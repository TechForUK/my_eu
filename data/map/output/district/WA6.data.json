The overall aim of VALERIE is to boost the outreach of research by facilitating the integration into innovative field practices. The work in VALERIE consists of three major approaches. (1). Stakeholder-driven approach. Ten case studies set the central stage for the bottom-up approach of the project, aided by highly effective tools of web semantics and ontology. Cases are centred around a specific supply-chain, a farming sector or a landscape. The stakeholder communities (SHC) represent the natural networks engaged in innovation. They drive the process of articulating innovation needs, enabling the retrieval of precisely matching knowledge and solutions, and evaluating their potential in the local context. (2) Theme-driven approach. VALERIE retains six thematic domains that are at the heart of sustainable production and resource use. These six provide the back-bone for structuring the annotation and summarising activities, which in turn will provide a vast body of knowledge accessible via the Communication Facility (CF). (3) Knowledge disclosure. VALERIE will launch a \u2018Communication Facility\u2019 (CF) for the EIP-Networking Facility. The CF supports communication amongst actors in the field and researchers. Next, it injects new knowledge into the innovation process, by enabling users to retrieve highly relevant (tailored-to-needs) information, based on their own vocabularies. In offering tools for communication, as well as content structured for efficient knowledge retrieval, the CF fuses the advantages typical of \u2018learning networks\u2019 and \u2018linear\u2019 modes of knowledge sharing. The CF will be set up, tested and integrated into the EIP-NF platform, as a generic infrastructure for use by \u2018fresh\u2019 stakeholder communities, also beyond the life of the VALERIE project.", 37369.0, 3074483.0, "VALERIE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.adas.uk", null, "fp7_111331_916021538"], ["0AR", "Developing SUstainable PERmanent Grassland systems and policies", "Rsk Adas Limited", "The existence and management of permanent grasslands (PG) is key to the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (ES) across Europe.

Using a list of 20 value chains reflecting the market diversity, and a list of 20 farm networks covering the diversity of grain legumes and fodder legumes species, LEGVALUE will demonstrate the added value of various legumes value chains and will provide a range of solutions to improve the economic interest of each actor involved in the value chains to use legumes. The feature of LEGVALUE is an approach to research that takes stakeholder-driven objectives. The gap between research and practice will be overcome with close collaboration between non-academic actors and scientists. LEGVALUE will result in the first decision tool for farmers to choose the optimal legume species with their adapted crop management and to assess the economic and environmental benefits of legumes in the cropping and grassland systems. LEGVALUE will contribute to identifying the supply chains that are the most competitive to foster legumes crops so helping the EU to identify: i) the technological topics that must be supported in priority to enhance legumes development; ii) insights into how to support actors coordination for better added value sharing iii) the new standards that will help trade and process of legumes.

The severity of each of these depends strongly on the unexpected enhanced permeability pattern, which may develop as an unwanted by-product of the fracking processes and may become pathway for gas and fluid migration towards underground water reservoirs or the surface. An important part of SHEER will be devoted to monitor and understand how far this enhanced permeability pattern will develop both in space and time. These hazard may be at least partially inter-related as they all depend on this enhanced permeability pattern. Therefore they will be approached from a multi-hazard, multi parameter perspective. SHEER will develop methodologies and procedures to track and model fracture evolution around shale gas exploitation sites and a robust statistically based, multi-parameter methodology to assess environmental impacts and risks across the operational lifecycle of shale gas. The developed methodologies will be applied and tested on a comprehensive database consisting of seismicity, changes of the quality of ground-waters and air, ground deformations, and operational data collected from past case studies.

Until December we had a French specialist on the staff who taught and led French across the school. When she left at Christmas, the school was left with a new subject leader and one member of staff to teach French. Due to timetabling constraints that now means that French is only delivered to Key Stage Two where it is statutory.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the objectives of our project are to support the new subject leader in her role and to build on existing  staff skills and confidence so that we can develop a team approach to the teaching of French across the whole school. We aim to provide a rolling development programme that will provide staff with the opportunities to not only increase their linguistic skills but provide them with intercultural knowledge and experiences that they can then share with the children at our school. We have built up very successful partnerships with schools in South Africa under the AfriTwin programme which has brought Africa alive to our pupils. We want to use this model to form partnerships with French schools to bring a European dimension to Hillside.\r\nHaving identified our school's needs, we have found a course provider that will address them. We have established a selection panel and have invited interested, committed staff to apply to undertake such a project.

This will enable participants to grown in confidence due to an increased skill level and first hand, authentic experiences. Each wave of participants to go to France will, on their return, plan and deliver whole staff training to increase the skills level off all staff in school. This will enable the next set of participants to go on their course better prepared so that they can take more on board.

We will see children keen to communicate with children from other countries, asking questions and celebrating differences. We will see French being used not only in French lessons, but across the curriculum, embedded in classroom practice. The children will leave our school and arrive at Secondary school with a confident grounding in French and transferable life skills.

We need to widen the children's viewpoint of the European dimension and help them to see the link between this and the language that they are learning in school. 6 members of staff over a 2 year period will attend intensive, personalised course in France and also spend time in a French primary school. This link will be maintained over the 2 year period to support both staff and pupils to improve their language learning and awareness of other cultures. The members of staff who are taking part in the scheme will be responsible for delivering French language lessons in a variety of different ways upon their return and they will therefore have boosted their confidence in their own spoken and listening skills, and also have collated a wealth of quality, native speaker resources which they can use alongside their class teaching to add authenticity and a purpose to their teaching. These new skills will also be shared with other members of staff in staff meetings. The project involves sending 6 members of staff over a 2 year period to intensive language and pedagogy classes in Carcassonne, France with PQ France. During this time staff are placed into ability classes best matched to their current language level. They will also have the opportunity to observe and teach in a French primary school, and share their practice with French teachers. Upon their return, the teaching staff will deliver reports to governors, parents and do assemblies with the children, to inform them of what has occurred and the impact it has had and will have on the children in our school. The staff will also lead staff meetings to disseminate the information in order to ensure that the message of a love of languages and a curiosity of other cultures is school-wide. The French co-ordinator will ensure that monitoring of lessons and content is carried out through book scrutinees, lesson observations and discussions with staff. The experience will also be shared at language hub partners opportunities and through our work as an Expert Centre for the Global Learning Programme.
