In the EU there is 1.3 out of 15 million persons with CP in the world. This neurological disorder affects body movement, balance and posture and almost always is accompanied by other cognitive or sensory impairments like mental retardation, deafness and vision problems. The severity of these problems varies widely, from very mild and subtle to very profound.\nThese disabilities lead to an inactive lifestyle which reduces the patient\u2019s physical health, social participation, and quality of life. Therapy costs can be up to \u20ac45,000 by year, a cost that cannot be afforded by most of the families. Playing Video games is a useful treatment that promotes and maintains more active and healthful lifestyle in these persons. This in turn contributes to reduce medical and social care cost and improve well-being of their families. However accessibility to videogames is hardly applied for them.\nGAME-ABLING is to create a software tool for creating interactive video games in an intuitive manner in such a way that non-expert personnel (e.g. parents) can develop customized games. Games will be controlled using body movements and voice. To this end, Computer Vision and image processing techniques will be developed to improve accessibility.\nGAME-ABLING  will create a web portal to make up a disabled gaming e-community in where users will have access to use the software tool, play games and upload own creations to share it. SMEs envisage GAME-ABLING exploitation following a subscription business model to have full access to the web portal.\nGAME-ABLING represents a business opportunity for the SMEs, who expect to reach 0.5% world market penetration and an accumulated income of \u20ac9.9 million in 5 years. In addition, GAME-ABLING will contribute to reduce medical and social care costs in the EU by at least 0.5% which supposes additional annual savings of \u20ac200 million.", 169999.0, 1249827.0, "GAME-ABLING", "Video games for cerebral palsy patients", "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuro-degenerative disease that affects 15 million people worldwide, and 1.3 million in the EU alone.

Cellular communications systems are planned using accurate/strict link budget allocation mechanisms, in order to keep the probability of outage in an acceptable range. The whole communication chain (coding, signalling chain, but as well as higher layer protocols) is optimized for the operation in this range. Therefore, communication services perform poorly or fail completely in unpredictable environments. Future networks will most likely be heterogeneous and dense, a structure which can be exploited if communication schemes are constructed on an appropriate the theoretical, technological, and practical basis. In order to establish this basis, RESCUE proposes the integrated concept 'links on the fly' which encompasses the key technologies of distributed joint source/channel coding in lossy wireless networks,\uf02d exploitation of multi-path information transfer in wireless mesh networks,\uf02d distributed and centralized MAC/network protocols for channel access, and routing,\uf02d cross-layer design for interference management and error control.This will allow to achieve successful and robust information transfer through multi-path networks that are constructed from lossy point-to-point links, \uf02d adaptability of information quality to the specific quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications and devices for higher spectrum and energy efficiency and  the integration of diverse communication infrastructure such as base stations, relays, and satellites, and terminals for network robustness and fast provision of communication.
