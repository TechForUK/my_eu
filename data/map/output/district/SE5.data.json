The founding principles of 1st Place are to provide innovative, high quality early learning experiences for young children, and training, volunteering and employment opportunities for local parents and other residents, supporting the regeneration of the community to contribute to long-term social and economic stability. \r\n\r\nWe serve an area of high deprivation in the north west of the London Borough of Southwark. We have grown over the last 12 years and are now delivering early education to 250+ children, as well as providing support services to children and families in the wider community through the Sure Start Children's Centres programme. The community we serve is within the 10% most deprived in England.\r\n\r\nWe have participated over the last year in a peer review programme, led by Southwark Teaching Schools Alliance. Exploring how well middle managers were enabled to develop highlighted a reliance on established leaders and the need to identify potential leaders in existing staff, to enable greater distribution of leadership responsibility. In addition, emerging leaders need to be enabled to see their role as one beyond the day to day management of their teams, and one of being strategic, motivational and forward thinking. This will be essential to maintain the quality of our early years provision, which is influenced by the Reggio Emilia approach, as well as to ensure future leaders have the skills and confidence to respond to changes within the sector and the needs of our community. The objective of this application is to obtain the funding that we need to address this need, to enable our provision to continue to flourish.\r\n\r\nAs part of our strategic succession plan, we intend to take a group of eleven early education staff to SERN in Bologna for one week immersion training in 2019. The provider has established links with our borough  and has previously coordinated projects with other settings and has been recommended to us by a number of school leaders.. This visit will include input from local experts, their regional education administration, local schools and kindergartens and a cultural programme. \r\n\r\nFollowing this,  2020 we would like to take the same group to attend a course delivered by Jarfalla Municipality, in outer Stockholm, Sweden.  This  will include municipality input and discussions with heads from that borough and visits to a number of primary and pre-schools. Jarfalla Municiapality undertook  a successful Reggio project with Southwark on 'Leadership' from 2012 -- 2014.  (See page 165 of the Comenius Partnerships Compendium at:  http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/repository/education/library/others/comenius-compendium-2013_en.pdf)\r\n\r\n Our objectives are\r\n - To explore different models of leadership, and identify those most suited to our approach to early education and to provide the most effective management of our nursery in order to provide the best early education environment for children. It will also give us the opportunity to look at our  current teaching practice. \r\n\r\n- To strategically plan for succession within the Senior Management team. To ensure that the existing skills within the team are shared, and through this develop the leadership skills of middle managers to ensure all our our provision is outstanding.   \r\n\r\nThese courses will provide the 1st Place leadership team with the opportunity to explore leadership models in two European countries, and how this is applied to early years settings in each region.  Through this opportunity our nursery staff will gain experience outside the day to day provision within the English education system, and expect significant personal and professional development as a result of these training activities.  This will enable 1st Place to maintain and build on the skills in our senior leadership team, supporting the development of the wider staff team to ensure that children have the best quality early education experience, and parents have a good understanding of early learning. \r\n\r\nAs a Children's Centre we have a remit to share good practice with other settings especially those outside the maintained sector, who have limited training budgets. We invite these partners to our three INSET days planned across the year. We will use the skills and knowledge gained through leadership focused training days to support training within the setting.  These sessions take place at monthly twilight staff meetings.

In current clinical practice, patients with chronic CAD are followed using non-invasive imaging methodologies for possible adverse morphologic remodelling and functional recovery of the myocardium before the decision for invasive examinations and treatments is taken.  Technological developments have brought about several newer imaging methodologies (and associated parameters) that have shown accurate prognostic results under study conditions in selected patient populations. Each of these methodologies offers intrinsic advantages and disadvantages due to the physiologic processes it tries to assess, due to the technology it requires or due to its availability (often determined by its associated cost). However, to date, no large scale studies have made a direct comparison of the different methodologies towards predicting adverse morphologic remodelling or functional recovery of the myocardium after medical therapy. The lack of such information results in a sub-optimal use of the methodologies at hand.

However, a decrease in these vocations is now threatening progress and improvement of healthcare, thereby impacting on economic competiveness worldwide. \n\nIDIBAPS, the leading biomedical research institute of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Spain) as pioneer in fostering clinician scientists, proposes a 60-month innovative fellowship programme called BITRECS, Biomedicine international training research programme for excellent clinician-scientists, based on excellence only. Through 2 international peer-reviewed calls, it invites 10 fellows to implement a 36-month bottom-up research project through an outgoing phase (12-18 months at any worldwide institution outside Spain) and a return phase (18-24 months at IDIBAPS), helping to make a lasting impact within the European Research Area and put the European Union ahead of the game in this crucial area of human health. \n\nBITRECS is an international, intersectorial and interdisciplinary programme. This transnational mobility scheme will boost the fellows\u2019 professional growth through: 1) continuous career support (scientific supervision, career mentoring and support for exploiting/disseminating the results); 2) participation in scientific and non-scientific training/networking activities linked to both sectors (academic and non-academic); and, 3) sharing experiences with peers from different disciplines.\n\nIDIBAPS, with its HRS4R strategy aligned to the European Charter and Code and a strong background in other human resources programmes guarantees a successful implementation.", null, 1852146.0, 8, 19, "BITRECS", null, "http://www.kch.nhs.uk", null, "h2020_210351_998711516"]]}}}}
