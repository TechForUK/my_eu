Therefore, it is essential to tailor our school\u2019s current educational strategy to suit the latest EU norms and standards for education. Accordingly, it is important for both teachers and students to develop \u2018soft skills\u2019 such as proactivity, creativity and competitiveness, and for this, the approach to teaching, and learning, respectively, has to be rejuvenated. In this sense, our major objectives are: \r\n- to improve knowledge about the new teaching and assessment methods with regard to the competences that can be acquired in formal/ non-formal context. Eight teachers (selected in consideration of their availability to get involved in a long-time enterprise like this) are to acquire four innovative methods in four different countries with the help of four different partners throughout the two-year project;\r\n- to acquire soft (practical, analytical, emotional and social) skills that the participants in the mobility  to schools with a strong tradition in education of high standards can share with their colleagues\r\n- to put our school on the map of the European schools, and thus manage to attract better prepared students and teachers. It is expected that those already learning/ working in our school will become more motivated and active to improve themselves on a professional as well as interpersonal level; \r\nWe have made up a project team with very clear tasks such as applying various types of questionnaires in order to identify problems, set up objectives and suggest the best activities that can be organized in order to get the expected results. We have collaborated in this sense with our Belgian partner with whom we have also developed a number of eTwinning projects, and decided to organize a job shadowing activity in order to gain hands-on experience on their approach and practices. \r\nWe have selected three different courses in three different countries by different providers with the aim of expanding our opportunities to access various educational representatives in the European community. Two teachers will take part in each mobility; one of them is responsible for teachers\u2019 training, and the other has to carefully observe the activities that those schools have designed for students. \r\nThe fact that each participant in the mobility has to train two teachers and provide two educational materials to integrate and evaluate curricular competences into non-formal activities will have a cumulative and long-term effect. All the resulting materials will be uploaded on the Internet to be freely used by both students and teachers  so that: \r\n- they all become well aware that education continues in the non-formal context, too. Such a context strengthens the student-teacher-parent and even teacher-teacher interrelations even further, due to the more relaxed and friendly environment that it creates, but it also offers a more concrete approach to real-life situations and work market.   Therefore, the competences acquire in the non-formal/ informal context must be included to complete formal education; \r\n- teaching staff will grow more motivated and self-confident in their own ability to readjust their teaching methods to the standards of quality and interactivity like those proliferated in schools in the European space, as well as to include new technologies in the curriculum. By actively participating in a mobility and coming into direct contact with colleagues from other European schools, our teachers will trust in the school\u2019s capacity to regain its success and prestige by starting to carry out activities similar to those observed during the mobility;\r\n- our school will win a vote of confidence from potential students and teachers who may consider choosing it as a viable institution where education can be delivered in the best conditions. Thus, the new activities will have a positive impact especially on students, which may lead to an increasing number of learners who opt to continue their studies in our school.\r\nAt the end of the two-year project, we expect that:\r\nThe entire community in our school will become aware of the importance of life-long learning approach and the significant contribution that the non-formal education brings along.  \r\nNew technologies will be integrated more frequently into the teaching/ learning process\r\nTeaching staff will be more assertive and motivated to apply the newly acquired methodologies because students are more familiar with the latest technologies and will thus respond to the proposed activities more actively\r\nA better educational environment in which both students and teachers feel they can easily engage themselves with one another.", "http://www.merganser.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA101-014818_3"], ["9DF", "Gestionar, Formar, Ense\u00f1ar y Aprender Idiomas en un Entorno Europeo de Calidad", "Merganser Consulting Ltd", 4457.0, "\"MANAGING, TRAINING, TEACHING AND LANGUAGE LEARNING IN A EUROPEAN QUALITY ENVIRONMENT\"\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nThe Official Language School of Ll\u00edria is a public institution, relatively young, whose Management Team and teaching staff have not enjoyed stability in their composition.

The project TIICEE aims at renovating the pedagogy in our school because we have to admit that too many pupils aren't interested in learning any more and we, teachers, find really difficult to motivate them. We need to teach differently and they need to learn differently too. We have listed our priorities: first we think that it is vital to widen their intercultural approach so that they can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Then we think that the pupils must use the ITC tools intelligently and properly. Finally we need to develop the \"working together\", the autonomy, the creativity and the choice-making process in all the teenagers so that they can find a good job. A group of 6 teachers and a member of staff have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The structured courses with school visits (\"job shadowing\") are meant to observe and understand new and innovating teaching practices in countries such as Iceland, Finland or Ireland. Other training sessions are more specialized and concern the science teacher, the sports teacher, drama techniques  and ITC tools.

This is an enormous step forward in the creation of training and employment opportunities within sustainable building in both the UK and across Europe.  It would also be in direct support of the global Paris agreement on climate change 2015, through the accreditation of natural, low carbon emission building materials in construction.With the recent acceptance and recognition of earth building training within the UK National Occupational Standards (NOS 2015),comes the need for recognised qualifications (NVQ or other) which do not currently exist in the UK.  To meet this need an approved assessment process with verified assessors is required, opening the door to National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) and other certified training in the UK. NOS and NVQ development are successful outcomes of a previous European Partnership Programme (KA2 PIRATE).  The UK is unique within Europe for having achieved the NOS for earth building, and as such is in a unique position to empower not just our own industry to accept, adopt, train and employ workers in earth building technology, but to help European partners to do so. It is only possible to offer accredited training in earth building when verified assessors are appointed.  Assessors in turn need training, assessor experience and validation, which can only be gained from partner European countries already trained and proficient in delivering assessment and qualifications in earth building techniques.  So the project aims to train potential assessors (all of whom will be practitioners and trainers in different earth building techniques, many of whom will already have been instrumental in the creation of the Units of Learning Outcomes for the new PIRATE Earth Building Training Program.  Our partner countries of France, Germany, Slovakia and Spain are committed to a partnership of assessor training for EBUKI members, which in turn will offer UK accredited  training and qualifications for both European and UK earth builders and trainees.Earth building is  both traditional and modern, businesses operate in the UK which both build new dwellings, public and commercial buildings while others are conserving and repairing the thousands of existing earth structures.Earth building is sustainable, using materials which are both locally available do not have the climate changing emissions associated with most modern building materials. The PIRATE project allowed 18 organisations from 8 countries to analyse and write the activities involved in earth building. Units of Learning Outcomes were written allowing training organisations, builders and contractors to structure their training in a new way, respecting European differences in training culture but at the same time allowing the assessment of outcomes to be universally applied. In the UK this process of writing Units has already allowed the National Occupational Standard (NOS), to change to accepting earth as a material with a training curriculum, the first country in Europe to do so under the active engagement of EBUKIParticipants to this application are lifelong learners who already work with and have experience of earth building and as trainers. As a largely self taught industry which has had little mainstream support all will already have shown a great deal of self motivation. They are also passionate about passing on the skills they have to another generation. For most this is the first opportunity to pioneer an officially recognised qualification in their field and will be a boost not only to what and how they teach but to their own practice.Activities include attending assessed workshops under the supervision of certified assessors to give experience of assessment and to certify new assessors. While ECVET assessors have been working for some time with earth plasters qualifications earth structures qualifications are the next step.

Therefore the learners will be able to travel themselves to get useful tools and methods to secure their school and after-school project.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s positive outcome will have a substantial effect on the whole school community (teachers, school staffs, all the pupils _ including this time pupils with special needs, and those who are on the verge of leaving school due to a loss of interest).

The school serves about 475 students, starting from preschool to grade 9. The school is divided into primary and secondary schools, each led by its own head teacher. The secondary school also serves students from two other communities that are close by, Harbo and T\u00e4rnsj\u00f6. The economy has traditionally relied on agriculture and established craftsman trades. The general contentment with this lifestyle is likely the reason that the opportunities in academic careers have never been considered to be as important. Heby municipality has the largest percentage of young people in our county choosing not to aim for higher academic studies.\r\nProfessional and competent teacher can have a high impact regarding this matter. We strongly believe in integrating international issues and perspectives in different subjects. This will enhance the curiosity and the ability to live with and become aware of the values of a multicultural society. We believe that the educational politics of the EU has a great impact on the Swedish school which we see as one of the main factors helping our students reaching higher goals.\r\n \r\nAt this time we are looking to send 13 people from our staff. All of the school\u2019s head teachers are involved in this project and has made sure that key people from all stages and subjects, career teachers and representatives from the school health team. The teachers involved are all experienced and certified. As individual teachers we specialize in teaching specific age groups and therefore we feel that there is an urgent need to improve communication and co-operation within our own institution in order to improve the skill levels of our students in mathematics, foreign languages and increase the students\u2019 educational motivation and further studies. Our broad variety of students requires us teachers to constantly maintain high standards when it comes to inclusive teaching. We are planning to seek out new pedagogic and didactic ideas that will help us to grow as teachers and to create the school of the future. We want to be able to inspire and motivate our students to broaden their vision towards the opportunities that the European community brings. The school health team plays an important part in strengthening the students\u2019 motivation and the feeling of meaningfulness in life. In order to reach all students and make them feel included and involved, we need to improve our skills when it comes to the preventive work within the student health team. To make sure that the outcome reaches as many colleagues and students as possible at our school the selection of representatives for this project is crucial.\r\n \r\nWe are planning to collaborate with course organizers that have done ground breaking with focus on the aims of the life-long learning within the European programme. Each course contains elements connected to methodology and didactic which we want to improve. The majority of the selected courses develops our digital literacy which is prominent is the recently reformed curricula. Another of the selected courses highlights poor mental health which can be linked to early school leaving. This makes it important to strengthen the preventive and promoting work of the student health team. Thus we feel that it is valuable to get an insight into school health teams in other countries.\r\n \r\nOne of our present and future goals is to develop the language skills of our students in all subjects. The applied method aims to develop knowledge of different subjects and language skills at the same time, since languages are preferably learned in a meaningful context. The school has an urgent need to develop the students literacy in all subjects. This is an ongoing process that started during our last project and needs further development with the support of Erasmus+.

The purpose of the project is to develop the skills of key personnel of the school's staff. This group consists of teachers, student counselors and student health who will participate in courses in the areas of stress and burnout, integration through ICT, the development of employability of students, weak study background and global citizenship, Upplands-Bro high school also applies for a job shadow at four schools in Finland, the Netherlands and Spain, which has shown good results in the above mentioned areas.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we seek funding within the framework of KA1 is that Upplands-Bro High School has recently faced major challenges due to the large number of newly arrived refugee students who have come to school, while at the same time the school has a fairly difficult socio-economic area where many with higher merit values going towards the central parts of Stockholm, but those who are less motivated remain and choose the municipal option in Upplands-Bro high school.\r\n\r\nThese changes in the student base have meant that the school has been faced with major challenges, and the school leadership has therefore chosen to collaborate on the development of skills around these circumstances and begin to see them as an opportunity for development rather than just highlighting the problems. The school has also had falling results on students' national tests and grades, even there is a need to reverse that trend and improve the outcomes and quality of education at Upplands-Bro High School. In addition to the work in progress at school with study days and auscultations with teaching teachers as part of collegial learning, the staff and the municipal council have jointly expressed the need to strengthen the European dimension at school and to learn from other countries and schools that have been faced same challenges. By meeting colleagues from other countries under the professional guidance of course organizers, hope is to gain new skills and contacts that will lead to the school's desire to increase internationalization at school and, as a result, improve the quality of the business.\r\n\r\nThe school has participated in Erasmus + projects over the last year and everyone involved has been very pleased with that experience and it has become a renewed energy for the staff who have left and it has led to changes in the school. The hope is that this project will continue this development with an international dimension in school as well as with a more open attitude towards change awareness, the ability to reverse the negative trend of school through international experience exchange.\r\n\r\nIn this project application, we want 20 students from the staff group to get 4 courses and 4 job shifts in groups 2-3 to each occasion. The job shadows we want to implement have been made possible by a participation in the contact seminar in autumn 2017, where the contact was taken to match the development needs set by the school in its development plan.\r\n\r\nThe hope of the project in the short term is that the school will be attractive to both staff and students through increased security and well-being, which in turn will lead to increased merit values. Already now we can see the spreading effects of the international work that begins at school, more and more staff and students ask for the opportunity to participate in projects compared to a year ago and other schools in the municipality have asked to get help with their internationalization work. There is also a growing awareness of the Erasmus + projects we participate in, and which will be further strengthened with the help of this project.
