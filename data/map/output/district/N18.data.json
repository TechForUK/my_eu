Thus, the problems negatively affect the attitudes of teachers to the inclusive education and the special needs children and normal children cannot take advantageous of inclusive education. According to the researches, the teachers are not sufficiently aware of inclusive education and this situation negatively affects the application of inclusive education. Inclusive education is the part of education and learning activities which train socially beneficial students who act in compliance with the society but the required education cannot be provided for special needs kids because of lack of information about inclusive education. It is aimed in the Project that the students, who will be the preschool teachers in the future, will have skills to determine the problems and difficulties in school life as a result of training in Europe. The participants will understand the necessity and importance of inclusive education and this will make it easy for function of each element in the application of inclusive education in professional life. The participants will have information about types of disabilities for better understanding the students included in the inclusive education.The teachers will participate in the training activities in Europe, spread the subject to the larger mass and the students will be graduated as qualified in this subject as a result of training of trainers activity to be organized in the scope of the Project. In addition to this, the efficiency and capacity of the schools will increase and thus the individuals, who have self-confidence and develop themselves in economic, social, cultural and logical aspects at the end of training of trainers activities.
