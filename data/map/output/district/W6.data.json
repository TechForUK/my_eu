For this purpose, the QualiMaster infrastructure will enable autonomous proactive, reflective and cross-pipeline adaptation, in addition to the more traditional reactive adaptation. Starting from configurable stream processing pipelines, adaptation will be based on quality-aware component description, pipelines optimization and the systematic exploitation of families of approximate algorithms with different quality/performance tradeoffs. However, adaptation will not be restricted to the software level alone: We will go a level further by investigating the systematic translation of stream processing algorithms into code for reconfigurable hardware and the synergistic exploitation of such hardware-based processing in adaptive high performance large-scale data processing.

Cost estimates by EU governments indicate that billions of euros will be spent over several decades to implement WFD. There is an increasing level of concern on the implementation cost (financial and carbon). Integrated water quality models designed to predict the quality of water across the linked urban and rural scales in a catchment is seen as a tool to optimise this cost. Integrated Catchment Modelling (ICM) is based on linking numerous empirically calibrated sub-models of water quality processes.  Catchment scale WQ predictions are then used to justify investment. Current water quality sub-models contain significant uncertainty.  Methods have been developed to quantify uncertainty at a level however little work has been carried out to investigate WQ uncertainty propagation between sub-models. QUICS will develop a generalised catchment wide approach to uncertainty assessment that can then be used in WFD implementation studies. It will address uncertainty propagation at the spatial and temporal scales found in catchments and develop tools to reduce uncertainty by optimising sampling and monitoring and the objective selection of model structure.

Although cardiovascular mortality rates, adjusted for age, are generally declining, the prevalence of IHD is increasing due to the emergence of new risk factors.\n\nIn order to further reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, better prevention and management of IHD is needed. A common technique for the diagnosis of IHD is invasive coronary angiography, but its current diagnostic yeld is suboptimal mainly due to underutilization of non-invasive tests prior to the invasive study.\n\nThe EU-funded EVINCI-STUDY project investigated the diagnostic accuracy of combining non-invasive anatomical information from computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with functional information from stress imaging. The aim is to achieve earlier non-invasive detection and characterisation and thus better management of IHD. Project partners performed the investigations in a cohort of 697 patients with suspected IHD, and low-intemediate probability of disease, selected from 14 clinical centres across Europe.\n\nComparison of several imaging techniques for their diagnostic accuracy to detect obstructive coronary disease and predict revascularization revealed that CTCA had better diagnostic performance than stress imaging. Perfusion based imaging techniques (Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET)) had greater sensitivity, while wall motion based techniques (echocardiogram (ECHO) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)) had greater specificity. In addition, integration of CTCA with functional imaging increased diagnostic accuracy of functional imaging alone.\n\nProject members implemented a multimodal electronic tool to enable the organisation and visualization of all available information (clinical, biological and cardiac imaging) for a single patient. This ensured easy presentation of the integrated information at multiple levels of complexity to specialists and referring physicians, including medical practitioners.\n\nIn years to come, there will hopefully be a reduction in the use of invasive procedures, inappropriate revascularisation and health costs due to poor management.

Participants are the trainees who attend this business college. These students serve apprenticeships as office administration assistants, assistants in health care management, sport and fitness management assistants as well as event management assistants. The main objective of this program is to increase the mobility of the young people on the European labour market, to enlargen their language knowledge (especially acquiring authentic Business-English) and to enable them to gain intercultural experience and competences.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this project can be seen as an ideal way of introducing the advantages of the German dual education system to employers in other countries. The evalution of the English companies has always been very positive. Especially the practical knowledge combined with a high degree of theoretical background is highly appreciated by the employers in London.\r\n\r\nEach year about 20 trainees of the above mentioned professions take part in the project. When they start at H20 and at least once every year they are informed about the project at a meeting especially organised for that purpose. Those who are interested in it then must apply for participation. They apply at school but also directly with companies in London. These companies decide whom they will take on, mostly together with the organiser at H20 who is also responsible for booking flights and accommodation as well as informing about everything the participants need to know about their stay in London. \r\n\r\nNearly all participants have at least the German equivalent of a GCSE, most of them even the German university entrance qualification (similar to A-levels). This fact combined with the advantageous situation that many companies have been cooperating with our school for many years helps achieve a high level of quality of the work placements. Most companies know what to expect of the interns and try to find suitable, very often demanding tasks. Even companies that start cooperating with us mostly succeed in doing so due to the personal contact e. g. during the work placement. Companies that cannot offer suitable tasks or enough supervision very often inform us about that in order to avoid disappointment. Then they do not take on an intern that year but are of course contacted next time and in case that the situation has then improved take part in the project again. Ensuring a certain standard of quality is considered more important by us than increasing the amount of participants.\r\n\r\nIt is another advantage of the project that more and more companies in Hamburg consider sending their trainees to a work placement in London because they see that they benefit from the experience, increased competence and new contacts of their trainees. Although there are still companies that have to be convinced of this we are glad that due to the information that is spread e. g. at meetings of those who are responsible for the traineeships or on the H20 homepage people start thinking about letting their trainees particpate.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the events industry networking is an essential part of the business.

Artistic workshops: the first one, concerns the making of traditional food using the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, an ancient and traditional artistic art of Putignano, the city which will host the activities.

Gustave Eiffel High School of Bordeaux was chosen in 2014 to initiate this project. \r\nThis request responds to two rationales: first, a territorial reasoning, to galvanize rural areas; the other, to do with job fields, looking to support burgeoning sectors that are viewed as essential to the Aquitaine\u2019s development. For instance, the aeronautics and forestry industries. \r\nTo be successful, covering the whole territory of Nouvelle Aquitaine, we plan to integrate and support every high school and their respective European projects. Integral to the plan is to add two more high schools, one from Poitiers and another from Limoges Academies, to the about 50 high schools that are in the Bordeaux Academy.  Our ambition is to spread the Program throughout the new region \r\nGustave Eiffel High School integrates a \u201cCFA\u201d and in its desire of an internalization of the VET, helps apprentices do internships around Europe. It has been demonstrated that a short term mobility has benefits for the learners and, also, for their employers.  \r\nICT learners go on internships lasting six months, after three months of doing linguistic and cultural training. This ICT is designed to give an opportunity to young, recently graduated VET, HND and CT learners coming from Nouvelle Aquitaine High Schools, to register for training in which they will gain a valuable professional experience in a European company.\r\nThe VET learners from CFA fulfill a three-week internship in a company and have the option of validating a unit called \u201cmobility\u201d. It is essential that these learners have a professional supervisor to help them to get used to a new environment and so they can to fully take advantage of all their unique opportunity. The supervisor will also be evaluating the learning outcomes of this mobility period (e.g., reverse planning).\r\nOur aims for this Project are to promote youth employability and to offer the youth an international exposure. In fact, a lack of experience is one of the main obstacles facing the youth in their pursuit of their first jobs. \r\nOur participants improve their abilities and actively participate in the international transmission of knowledge and in opening businesses. They learn to assume responsibility and develop personal aptitudes which are useful in their future careers, leading to enhance opportunities for employment. \r\nWe want to anchor going abroad to do an internship in the VET courses and to participate in the recognition of this training that is very often disvalued. We have established a partnership with the UK ACCOR group, putting in place the ECVET system to, initially, to work with the hospitality industry. Our wish is to expand it to all business sectors at a later point.\r\nAfter the participants present and defend their internship report, they will receive a \u201cEuropass Mobilit\u00e9\u201d and a European Mobility Certificate or one of the ICT signed by the Chancellor from Bordeaux Academy and the President of the Regional Council. \r\nBecause of our concerns for equity and accessibility of mobility to disadvantaged young and rural students, we have launched an ICT Diffusion Kit (containing a video accessible to everyone to expand our audience and to adapt ourselves to different public) providing all the necessary information about the mobility and the training program. In addition to the website and social networks, we created informational brochures to be utilized (attached here).\r\nWe have taken into consideration the elements critiqued in the previous application in order to improve our practices, proving that we have the capacity to live up to VET Charter expectations.

It is possible to learn in any place and within society. In order to do so, connection and cooperation between families, schools and community must exist. It is not possible to involve the family in the school dynamic if educational institutions don\u2019t recognize them as the first strategic agent of learning. A school\u00b4s first challenge should be to articulate the necessary mechanisms to understand the reality of its families.  (Education Strategy 2020).\r\n\r\nAs teachers, we should adapt ourselves to a changing world that affects us as educators, our students, and their families without knowing how much and in what ways. Nevertheless schools should offer the necessary resources so that children can adapt to a constantly changing society that requires learning to learn, learning throughout one\u00b4s lifetime, and even learning to unlearn. \r\n\r\nTeachers have to introduce changes in methodology that support  families' proposals and students' learning needs in order to educate children in a holistic way. We expect a global impact of every anticipated result of our project. Therefore, during and after its completion, we expect improvement in the following areas:  Active familial participation in schools and the development of the curriculum, families\u2019 acceptance as being educational agents, multidirectional joint organization between family and school (feedback),forms of communication, information channels, utilization of new technologies for the exchange of information, relationships with our social surroundings, broadcasting our schools\u2019 work and projects through online forms of communication, opened learning communities among European early childhood educational centers. \r\n\r\nThe three infant schools in this project consider ourselves as responsible agents of change. We should favor an educational model where not only creativity and innovation are key objectives, but also where interactive, educational projects will be implemented. Within the collaborative school-family-community triangle, these new projects will point education towards developing the necessary skills that our students need to become involved and engaged citizens in the 21st century. \r\n\r\nThe S.E.L.F. project will give our families (more than 150) the opportunity to participate in educational projects, where one will be within a European dimension.
