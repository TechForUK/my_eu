Complex analysis of images from multiple cameras will become the norm in the future, from cars to industrial systems, from smart cities to facility monitoring, aimed at extracting meaningful, context-dependent information.\nToday\u2019s market is dominated by a combination of relatively simple, fixed function, configurable cameras that stream video to PC-based (and in some cases small embedded) gateways. These systems cannot scale beyond a certain size because of power consumption and the aggregate networking bandwidth required to stream videos to servers, where aggregated video analysis is performed. So the trend for visual analytics functions is that they get executed at the edge of these complex vision systems, e.g. in the cameras themselves.\nThe Cognitive and Perceptive Camera Systems (COPCAMS) proposal leverages recent advances in embedded computing platforms to design, prototype and field-test full large-scale vision systems. It aims at exploiting a new many-core programmable accelerator platform to power a new generation of vision related devices (smart cameras and gateways), able to extract relevant information from captured images and autonomously react to the sensed  environment by interoperating at large scale in a distributed manner.\n\nDate of approval by ECSEL JU: 11/07/2016.", null, 10963981.0, "COPCAMS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.asl-vision.co.uk", null, "fp7_111181_983072206"], ["2AQ", "DEvelopment platform for Safe and Efficient dRiVE", "Application Solutions (Electronics and Vision) Ltd", "According to a recent forecast published by ABI Research , a fast growth of the market of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) is foreseen in the next five years. For example, in 2016 the overall annual market for Lane Departure Warning systems is expected to reach 22 million units/year (corresponding to 14,3 billion dollars). This market growth will be possible only through the reduction of costs of components as well as the seamless integration of different functions in the same architecture. Since the market will include also low volume vehicles, there will be also a strong need to reduce development costs. Electric vehicles will be an additional catalyst for the ADAS market. The absence of engine noise requires the introduction of new means to protect vulnerable road users from these vehicles. On the other hand, electric vehicles can easily support (semi)automatic functions (such as parking manoeuvres and Stop&Go).\nTo manage the expected increase of function complexity together with the required reduction of costs (fixed and variable) DESERVE will design and build an ARTEMIS Tool Platform based on the standardisation of the interfaces, software (SW) reuse, development of common non-competitive SW modules,  and easy and safety-compliant integration of  standardised hardware (HW) or SW from different suppliers. With innovative design space exploration (DSE) methods system design costs can be reduced by more than 15%.\nHence, DESERVE will build an innovation ecosystem for European leadership in ADAS embedded systems, based on the automotive R&D actors, with possible applications in other industrial domains.\nSince the purpose of ADAS functions is also to support the driver, an advanced human-centred design strategy will be integrated in the Tool Platform. Therefore, the developed applications will provide natural and friendly  support to the driver, with proper levels of overall functional safety also during complex or emergency manoeuvres.\n-\n-\n-\nVersion approved by the JU on 14/07/2015", 82768.0, 19372210.0, "DESERVE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.asl-vision.co.uk", null, "fp7_104880_983072206"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2XN", "Lower ability maths teaching", "Priory School", 1080.0, "'Maths teaching and learning for lower-ability students -the Finnish model'\r\n\r\nPriory School has a need to develop more effective ways of teaching compulsory subjects, especially Maths.

Under section 8 of the Act of March the 5th, 2014 promoting vocational learning in France and the framework of strategic guidelines for the quality of learning in Grand Est, the Regional Council wants to encourage more European mobility of apprentices. Indeed, European mobility is a way to improve the vocational learning of apprentices and their skills related to social-economic issues. This regional project is for the apprentices from V and IV levels, who aren\u2019t very mobile, it will be coordinated by the Regional Council of Grand Est and associates 19 vocational training centers providing different domains of training (crafts, agriculture, catering trade, construction, services ...) from level V to level III. It aims to offer these apprentices the opportunity to experience a first work placement in Europe and acquire new professional, personal and language skills. Mobility, organized in groups, wants to be a leverage for building character of the apprentice, to strengthen its perception of the environment that surrounds him, to sharpen its ability to adapt to new constraints and at different working methods. The project will allow 556 apprentices to stop in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Czech Republic and other European countries in order to perform an internship during 2 or 3 weeks, and to benefit a preparation before departure between June 2017 and May 2019. This project will allow the mutualisation of human, technical and financial resources regarding the management and coordination of the project and ensure that Erasmus + funds are best used for the participants and their preparation for departure. Access to new skills is a challenge for the apprentices given the privileged geographical position border of Grand Est (only French region on the borders of three member states of the European Union - Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany \u2013 and Switzerland) which offers interesting job opportunities. Intermediate project partners are mostly vocational learning institutions, chambers and other European regions with which discussions have already taken place.

The project significantly increased our capacity in important ways that we want to build on.\r\n\r\nBased on the gains from the previous project we see: A shift in the culture of our organisation in terms of incorporating more experiential and participatory learning methodologies; development in terms of the inclusivity and diversity dimension of our work; strengthened connections with other like-minded organisations able to work together to reach our respective aims.\r\n\r\nWe aim to consolidate and build on these gains, especially our effectiveness in working to support some specific demographic groups who suffer disenfranchisement, disadvantage and vulnerability. Specifically, this includes: LGBT communities, disabled people \u2013 especially those who are hearing impaired, homeless people and those enduring precarious housing.\r\n\r\nWe want to increase our capacity to support diverse and disadvantaged learners; build on burgeoning shifts in quality, methodology and language for training approaches; increase our trainers' ability to secure paid employment. \r\n\r\nWe also seek to expand our work at a European level, forge stronger European connections for the sharing of best practices and strengthening sectoral capacity in terms of informal adult education, including the spread of entrepreneurial approaches.\r\n\r\nWe will send 15 of our trainers on courses and five of our team will be involved in carrying out teaching assignments. These participants range from experienced professionals to staff who work voluntarily for the organisation and who are economically precarious. \r\n\r\nWe are choosing trainings in educational approaches that have been shown to be effective in creating inclusive and empowering learning opportunities that can enhance people\u2019s capacity to live meaningful lives as healthy and valued members of society.\r\n\r\nThe trainings will enable staff to acquire skills that have been innovated and developed out of the body of work initiated by Augusto Boal. Boal\u2019s work is built on the Freireian idea that education should be a \u201cpractice of freedom, the means by which men and women deal critically and creatively with reality and discover how to participate in the transformation of their world.\u201d Focusing on issues of oppression and empowerment, these approaches are ideally suited to our needs. \r\n\r\nOthers attending structured trainings will be gaining competences related to the use of a wide range of creative tools in the context of participatory education. The trainings emphasise the use of these tools in the context of active citizenship. Based in a methodology of emergent focus they are highly learner centred approaches. \r\n\r\nA critical mass of staff will increase their knowledge, skill and competence in using pedagogical approaches that incorporate participatory methodologies, embodied learning, incorporating visual and audio arts based practices, and an increased repertoire for working with marginalised and disadvantaged groups. We will see an increase in our organisational capacity to meet our strategic objectives concerning provision of inclusive and empowering education. We will bring learning into the organisation about innovative approaches developed in Europe, and gain exposure to best practice being conducted by experts in the European context. \r\n\r\nThrough the teaching assignments staff will consolidate learning acquired through participation in a previous project with the partner; become equipped to champion the integration of these approaches in ways that will further our strategic objectives; gain valuable experience about the challenges of design and delivery of the above content in a \u2018training of trainers\u2019 context; and have the opportunity to share some of our best practice and competences.\r\n\r\nFor this project we have chosen a training provider who we know to show a high level of competence and professionalism in this kind of work. Their work in this area has influenced informal adult education in many organisations and grassroots settings across Europe. We want to learn from their expertise and build stronger relationships with them and other trainers they support. Through this we will benefit learners and build European capacity to deliver trainings for a better and more inclusive society.\r\n\r\nAt a time when there is such strain on the European project from social and political forces, we hope this kind of collaboration will help to strengthen citizen resolve to preserve and value the positive social and personal impact that European scale cooperation can have.", "http://www.movingsounds.org", "Moving Sounds C.I.C.", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-036078_coordinator"], ["1JU", "Want to stay up late, too!", "Stay Up Late", 10327.0, "This project is for youngsters with learning disabilities.

The inclusion of this latter student profile (approved by the MIUR since school year 2015/16) in the Project  fits in with the goal of the Cerletti Institute to internationalize the professions taught there. \r\nForeign partnership has been confirmed in order to continue and reinforce the educational alliance that has developed over time. \r\nFurthermore, International vision has been increased, according to the  Project strategy, thanks to two new partners: Czech Republic (Prague) and Slovenia (Maribor); these countries are wine competitors and are particularly interesting for the educational and training opportunities they can offer in this field. \r\nThe other destinations are confirmed: United Kingdom (Reading, Cardiff, Plumpton, Brighton), France (Cannes), Spain (Valencia), Austria (Wien). Some accompanying staff will be required as many participants are under age at the end of the fourth year.\r\nThe 6 staff mobilities  will be partially realized in 2017 (4 teachers) and completed in 2018.This planning has taken into consideration  the fact that the staff mobility has been fully and successfully realized in the current project and, thanks to the interest  and expectations aroused, it has had a positive impact  on the sending institutions.\r\nThis is the reason why the schools want to make the most of the results achieved that are: implementation or increase of CLIL modules; development of language education; increased number of   certifications for teachers (5 more certifications according to the number of teachers enrolled at certification courses). In addition, next year the number of staff applications will be more than double the places available thanks to the promoting activities carried out by each individual institution.\r\n\r\nAn important element in the Consortium plan of international development is the increase of other kinds of mobility: the schools are applying for MOVE 4.0 Call (DGR Veneto n.1866/2016) in order to organize study holidays with compulsory B1 certification. If financed, 90 3rd year students will be involved and they are prospective candidates for Erasmus + mobility in 2018. The school will organize, as usual, self-financed study holidays (50 participants) and school trips focused on linguistic, cultural and professional learning. An increase of 1-2 groups for each school is foreseen. This number is only apparently low as these activities are often an alternative to exchanges, that are the most important mobilities in the schools of the Consortium. More in detail, the institute Cerletti aims at increasing the following actions: mutual cooperation with foreign vocational institutions; training in internationalized firms (two exchanges in FR, 2 in DE, 1 in CZ); continuation of the project VITEA 2015-FR01-KA202-015381 regarding high vocational training for the profile of Certified Trimmer integrated in the ECVET system. In 2016 this Project involved 32 students, 18 teachers, 2 French ECVET experts and 8 European schools. Furthermore, next year the Institute Cerletti is planning to start two new exchanges: one institution in Krems (AT) following the Vinea Project and one institution in Novo Mesto (SL). \r\nThe Institute F. Da Collo, in addition to the exchange with a school of Isernhagen (DE, 40 students), will go on with the organization of an exchange with the French  \u201cLycee de la Vallee du Cailly\u201d (Rouen,  4th year students). An additional mobility, if financed, is the school-work experience abroad (MOVE Call for ASL DGR 1914/29-11-16 POR-FSE).\r\nThe Consortium will increase the number of the B1, B2, and C1 certifications for the students (120 at the moment) in the languages studied.
