Across the MEDA region youth work happens on the frontline of conflict, political uncertainty and issues of migration and the Balkans, much similar to Italy in terms of youth work environment and current state of affairs, are also still dealing with the consequences of war.\r\nWhat is common for all is that there appears to be natural or structured pathway or transition for progressing from being a young person in the youth club to becoming a youth leader, and in most countries there is no recognition tool for young people or newcomers to youth work to develop their leadership skills and youth work practice.

Out of studies, such as The European Youth Forum\u2019s study about the contribution of non-formal education in terms of increased employability, the soft skills that employers most frequently demand include communication skills, organisational/planning skills, decision-making skills, team working skills, confidence/autonomy and numeracy. Five of these six most frequently demanded soft skills that employers require are also being amongst those skills developed to a greater extent in youth organisations, the exception being numeracy. \r\nThese soft skills are seen as a key element for successful job performance. Certain personality traits are also found to be important components of these skills and competencies, contributing to their development.  For example, sense of initiative and pro-activity are traits associated with confidence/autonomy and entrepreneurship. Employers do also have a positive attitude towards young people\u2019s experience in youth organizations. Employers however stress a special emphasis on the way of presenting the skills and competences (what they present, how they present it has more impact than what is written on the paper) acquired during the participation in youth work, which is an area where there is still room for improvement. \r\n\r\nIn youth work, we have the instrument of the youth pass at European level,  a lot of countries have own national recognizing tools for competences, and each young person can use the European CV format (the Europass CV) for presenting the skills and competences towards employers. But only few still know, how to work effectively with it (e.g. what to present if I have already Youthpass from 6 different events). \r\n\r\nWith this project we want to bring youth workers together, to support them in enabling young people to better assess and express their competences for employment purposes.\r\n\r\nYoung workers should be made more aware about the value that employers place on the skills and the competencies developed in the youth work, and youth workers can be trained in how to support the young people they work with, in this topic.

Together we know more than alone and we can learn a lot from each other. As a school we decided that it is good to continue looking for ways how mobile technology is used. This was picked up by the ICT-er and teacher of the school. Also the staff member of the foundation of the school decided to think about this. By means of job shadowing at 2 different schools who are already far in the use of mobile devices, both in their own ways, our school and our foundation hopes to learn as much as possible about the effective use of mobile technology and the skills of the teachers involved. By means of a course we hope that we will get in touch with even more schools and that we will learn as much as possible through workshops including demonstrations and simulations of lessons, lesson plans and classroom management, so that in a few years we will know what we have to do with mobile devices in the classroom and use them effectively and hopefully then take the next step in the use of mobile devices for working thematically with the subjects history, nature and geography.", "http://www.layton.blackpool.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA101-038819_1"], ["7SY", "Effective digital habits for digital youth work", "Think Forward CIC", 57631.0, "\u2018Effective Digital Habits for Youth Work\u2019 aims to explore and build the required youth work competences to promote online good practice, a better understanding of digital youth work, a confidence to embrace and engage in the digital world that young people exist and a platform for utilising the digital opportunities for promoting what we do and celebrating our success and outcomes.\r\n\r\nTen partner organisations from: The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Lithuania, Germany, Cyprus, Belgium, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Ireland will each identify and support a total of 90 participants in the 3 mobilities (induction seminar, training and evaluation seminar) that will be held in The Netherlands and Lithuania. The participants will be leaders and decision makers from partner organisations or associated organisations, youth leaders and youth workers, social workers and volunteers working with young people, those individuals who are maybe struggling to maintain their digital competences as well those who are embracing and following some of the digital developments.\r\n\r\nMobility 1: iDigital Seminar - will lay foundations for developing general understanding of youth work and digital realities, digital youth work concept and needs for digital competences and literacy, will introduce Covey\u2019s paradigms and principles and will approach 3 of the first habits for effective digital youth work and will establish cooperation for digital alliances. \r\n\r\nMobility 2: Grow Digital Training Course - will deepen competence development and increase capacity of partner organisations to plan and implement digital youth work having the strategic perspective in mind. Participants will continue developing necessary competences and will train on their four other habits for effective digital youth work. The cooperation within digital alliances will continue and will bring practical insights. \r\n\r\nMobility 3: Digital Harvest Seminar - will look for practical solutions that digital youth work can offer to address the needs and problems that young people and youth work has in the digital age. This activity will also conclude and capitalise on the learning outcomes, results, and achievements of the previous phases of this project and will allow participants and partner organisations to prepare dissemination content, products and strategies to achieve sustainable impact of this project. \r\n\r\nThere will be practice phases between mobility activities to support practical application of learning from mobilities to youth work realities of partner organisations, young people, local partner networks, and community. We see that competence and habit development can happen only and when participants apply their new learning to practice and then reflect the success and challenges of such application.\r\n\r\nFor \u2018What - learning outcomes\u2019 we chose a competence framework developed by the European expert group on digitalisation of youth work. This group identified 7 areas of competences where youth workers need to develop:\r\n1. Digitalisation of society\r\n2. Planning, designing and evaluating digital youth work\r\n3. Information and data literacy\r\n4. Communication\r\n5. Digital creativity\r\n6. Safety\r\n7. Reflection and evaluation\r\n\r\nThe above competence model will be used transversally during all phases of our project. We will provide reflection and self-assessment tools for participants to monitor the development of their digital competences.\r\n\r\nFor \u2018How - learning outcomes\u2019 we chose a framework of Covey\u2019s 7 habits for effective leadership which we already employed in previous long-term training programmes for youth workers and youth leaders. These are the areas of competences covered by Covey\u2019s 7 habits:\r\n\r\n1. Being proactive\r\n2. Having the end in mind\r\n3. Putting first things first\r\n4. Think win-win\r\n5.

ORA Methodology provide young people with direct opportunity to Observe their context (local and international), to Rethink their own role (as individuals and as members of society) and to Act as responsible citizens to strengthen the community. This project find its roots in the project \"ORA: green tools to enhance the social inclusion of young people and sustainable development of local communities\" (2016-2-DE04-KA105-014202) realised by ORA Network in 2017, when a working group was created involving all partners defining aims, objectives and contents.\r\nThe project \"ORA: Non Formal Environmental Education to enhance youth inclusion\" consist of 3 main Activities (Study Visit, Training Course, Seminar). Partners come from UK, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria. The duration will be 11 months. Study Visit will be in Italy lasting 5 days, Training Course will be in Belgium lasting 8 days, Seminar will be in Germany lasting 4 days.

Each Activity will have 1 person per partner coming from fewer conditions (Economic, Geographical and Social obstacles). Objectives to reach are:\r\nOrganize a multi-activity project, including a Study Visit, a Training Course, local activities and a Seminar, to build capacity for NGOs, youth workers, young people, to use Non Formal methods in Environmental Education to enhance possibilities of involvement, inclusion and active engagement among young people from disadvantaged conditions.\r\nVisit, share and know good examples and best practices realised at European level on the use of Environmental Education and Non Formal Educations as tool for the inclusion, involvement and engagement of young people and for the growth of local communities.\r\nShare results and outcomes and to apply the knowledge and competences acquired in the project with the local communities in order to aware/sensitise civil society, citizens, institutions and to contribute in developing higher quality initiatives that will at the same time activate and integrate in the community young people with fewer opportunities.\r\nProduce a final booklet in which to collect all the outcomes of the project in order to make them available, useful and reproducible by other interested groups.\r\nPlan follow up measures to be realised both at local level, applying the competences acquired during the project (multiplying effect) and at international level through the Erasmus+ Programm in order to generate further possibilities of inclusion and involvement of young people.\r\nProject will involve 85 persons (27 from fewer conditions): 7 are facilitators and 6 support staff. Study Visit will focus on acquiring knowledge about good practices and experiences on the use of Environmental Education and Sustainable Development to involve and include young people providing positive development of territories. Training Course will generate an experience of significant development of skills and competences thanks to the \"Workshop path\" (Environmental education modules, Sustainable life style, Positive promotion of a territory). Local activities will involve young people and will be small events, workshops, outdoor initiatives, providing practical dimension of what participants have learnt in Activities 1 and 2. Seminar will evaluate, elaborate and rationalise all the previous steps (including the local activities) and identify quality elements of the educational, learning and practical path of the project. It will set a methodological and educational platform of shared standards and quality elements on how to use Non Formal methods in Environmental Education to facilitate processes of inclusion, involvement and engagement of young people and especially those coming from fewer conditions.

Media - In our own Image", "Think Forward CIC", 38378.0, "The overarching aim of work with girls and young women is to empower them to live happy,  healthy and fulfilling lives where they are afforded opportunities to reach their full potential. Kabeer (1999) argues that to empower girls and young women the following criteria, which are indivisible, must be met. Girls and young women must have; ownership of resources, the power to participate in decision making processes and also well-being and achievement. \r\nEvidence of research highlights that providing the opportunity for young women to engage with their peers in a single gendered environment on a regular basis enables opportunities for girls and young women to explore topical issues and also creates room for them to build knowledge, learn new skills and build meaningful relationships with professionals, as well as their peer group.\r\n\r\nThe partnership for this ambitious all female youth exchange are from the UK, Italy and Netherlands all working with the lead organisation from Ireland. \r\nThe aim of this long-term Youth Exchange project is to explore the portrayal of women in the media and the impact this has on young women today. \r\nThe young women from Ireland were the first to identify the desire to do a youth exchange and then quickly identified the focus and then partners were searched for. Once partners were confirmed, the young women predominantly from the UK and Ireland were instrumental in shaping the content for the application based on organisational activities in youth councils and young women\u2019s groups locally. This was done through face to face meetings an online consultancy with the young women. This helped to identify a project name, confirm dates, intentions, interest and the type of activities.  \r\n\r\nThe project aims to provide the opportunity to bring 32 young women, Age 15-20. from 4 countries who hold no prejudice towards each other and are in similar social settings with similar issues and concerns.  Leading on from this, it is hoped to explore how women are regarded, not only in society but in the media which is one of the biggest influences in their lives.  There are two youth exchange mobility's planned; one for August 2018 in Italy and the final one in January 2019 with identified 5 phases throughout the whole process;. \r\nPhase 1 - Lights, Camera - National meetings for preparation of first Youth Exchange\r\nPhase 2 - Action - Using the first exchange to share /explore the role of women and cultural differences\r\nPhase 3 - Girls Go Guerilla - Testing identified actions created in the Youth Exchange in their own realities and localities\r\nPhase 4 - Mirror Mirror on the Wall - Second Youth Exchange to review /reflect on the process and sharing the results, impact and outcomes\r\nPhase 5 - WoW (Working on Women) - Disseminating the results, outcomes and benefits of the project to wider stakeholders\r\n\r\nThe whole process is consultative, and the groups from each country will be kept informed weekly / monthly alongside their own work plans.  Specific Roles and responsibilities will fall on hosting country participants for certain activities, but group leaders will support fully.  All areas of calculating budgets, comparing to approved budget, planning travel itineraries, accommodation etc. will be part of the programme of preparation in clubs / projects.\r\n\r\nOur partners strongly believe that Youthpass represents a significant addition to the youth exchange experience. While some countries do the Youthpass during the exchange, This partnership will wait until they return from the 2nd exchange to re-engage young people about what they learnt on the exchange. We strongly believe that the Youthpass makes young people more confident, with the added advantage of increasing their employment prospects. Since the young people decide what they have learnt, it \u2018gives them a great sense of achievement and develops their skills of self-reflection and personal development\u2019 This will be addressed alongside the dissemination strategy in preparation for the final report.\r\nAll partner organisations will disseminate locally and through their websites and social media. They will talk about the project and outcomes through local meetings and share throughout their own local networks. \r\nFor the 4 partners this project will increase capacity for their local youth provision and offer. It is an opportunity to engage the leaders more in the organisation as well as building a positive wave of information and sharing in the community about the impact and benefits of Youth Exchanges. Addressing the issues and topic offer a sensitive and authentic way in which to promote equality and empower a group of women to create a range of media based messages to show who they are, want to be and how to support others.  \r\nThe groups are already forming plans for dissemination acknowledging the Women's Centenary in the UK and the international #MeToo movement.", "http://www.thinkforwardcic.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IE01-KA105-038745_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FY3"}
