Current research reveals that NEETs often lack self-confidence and the essential social skills needed to seek and secure employment. Youth inclusion associations across Europe provide social coaching programmes, in order to help young people acquire and improve their social competencies.  However, it is an expensive and time-consuming approach that relies on the availability of trained practitioners as well as the willingness of the young people to engage in exploring their social strengths and weakness in front of their peers and practitioners.Digital technologies such as serious-games offer the advantage of repeatable experience that can be modulated to suit the individual needs of the young people. Additionally, such technologies are intrinsically motivating to the young and carry the potential of removing the many barriers that real-life situations may pose, in particular the stress associated with engaging in unfamiliar interactions with others.TARDIS aims to build a scenario-based serious-game simulation platform for young people at risk of exclusion, aged 18-25, to explore, practice and improve their social skills.  TARDIS will facilitate the interaction through virtual agents (VAs) acting as recruiters in job interviews scenarios. The VAs are designed to deliver realistic socio-emotional interactions and are credible, yet tireless interlocutors. TARDIS exploits the unique affordances of digital technology, by creating an environment in which the quality and the quantity of emotional display by the agents can be modulated to scaffold the young trainees through a diverse range of possible interview situations.  The scenarios are co-designed with experienced practitioners in several European countries in order to ensure their relevance to the different individuals across a number of cultural contexts.TARDIS offers three major innovations. First, it will be able to detect in real-time user's emotions and social attitudes through voice and facial expression recognition, and to adapt the progress of the game and the behaviour virtual interlocutor's behaviour to the individual users. Second, it will provide field practitioners with an intuitive authoring tool for designing appropriate interview scenarios and for setting agents' behaviours without the help of computer scientists. Third, it will give practitioners a unique access to a systematic record of the specific difficulties that the users experience.

Furthermore, the provision of AD \u2013 i.e. verbal descriptions illustrating the visual elements of an AV product for the blind and visually impaired community \u2013 is uneven across Europe (ADLAB 2012, 2014). ADLAP PRO aims to fill this gap and it will define a curriculum for ensuring professional Europe-wide AD implementation in all cultural and media sectors through the creation of training materials to implement the new AD professional profile.  ADLAB PRO's work will produce a comprehensive snapshot of the current AD training practices in Europe (IO1) and outline the AD professional profile, its required skills and its competences (IO2). The results of IO1 and IO2 will be disseminated via website, publication, presentation at conferences, and dedicated Multiplier Events. Feedback coming from a varied range of stakeholders (i.e. from the \u2018horse\u2019s mouth\u2019) will be monitored and used to build subsequent activities. Crucially, the information gleaned for IO1 and IO2 will be used to delineate concrete training proposals based on different types of AD (TV, cinema, museums, live performance) in IO3. Then, based on IO3, training materials will be created (e.g. OERs, webinars, e-documents, recorded showcases, online tutorials, etc.) and made available as open deliverables of IO4. All IOs will be evaluated and tested (IO5) before more IOs are produced in order to monitor academic quality, real usefulness and adequate learning progress as well as to implement \u2013 as we go along \u2013 all feedback and improvements. The project will also look at the evaluation and accreditation of the educational components for both academic and vocational levels (IO6): ECTS/ECVETS will be attributed to each educational component to secure their quality, and also the project's sustainability and resilience. In this way, learners and workers will see their knowledge, skills, competence and qualifications quickly and easily recognized, thus raising their skill levels and increasing their employability.  These activities will be carried out through the synergy of educational and non-educational partners ensuring that the profile meets multiple market needs and the curriculum designed to train future AD experts is efficient, flexible in implementation, and of high quality. The HEI partners are the Univ. of Trieste (acting as leader), the Univ. of Antwerpen, the Autonomous Univ. of Barcelona and the A. Mickiewicz Univ. in Poznan, all successfully involved in the project ADLAB (2011-2014). Non-academic partners, selected for their diversified expertise and complementarity, are four. Utopian Voices, a private UK company supplying high-quality AD, training, research and data analysis in the field of AVT. Soundfocus, an audio post-production studio specialized in media accessibility and responsible for all major AD projects in The Netherlands. RTV Slovenija, the national public radio and TV house that recently incorporated AD in its programming and strives to implement it, disseminating good practices also across the Balkan Regions. The Royal National Institute for the Blind, a renowned UK charity that will rise project awareness in a country where AD is long-established amongst sophisticated AD users and providers.    Besides affecting directly higher education as well as trainees interested in AD and the AVT market, ADLAB PRO will have a strong long-term impact on a wide spectrum of potential beneficiaries of the ADs produced by the new AD professionals. These include the blind and visually impaired communities but also vulnerable audiences (elderly, physically or mentally challenged groups, people with special needs and learning disabilities including those diagnosed with autism) and any new citizens wishing to integrate into the cultural environment of their new homeland (migrants).  The training material produced by ADLAB PRO will be open, online and free, but also modular and fully customizable: it will be possible to use the modules all together as a comprehensive course, or separately in different constellations. This offers added value to the project (1) enabling anyone to access and be trained via this material, regardless of their professional or academic background; (2) offering its deliverables worldwide, thus enabling EU\u2019s know-how, access concepts and guidelines to be disseminated effortlessly across the globe; and (3) securing resilience, since the online material will have validity for many years. Since media accessibility and AD are still unknown to many countries, the curriculum and the training material produced by ADLAB PRO may seem dated in regions where accessibility and AD are well under way (UK, USA), but will be cutting edge for others (Myanmar, Balkan regions, etc.).", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA203-024311_1"], ["9HF", "Professional Standards Framework for Excellence in Teaching and Learning in Lebanese Universities", "STAFF AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPPMENT ASSOCIATION", 545057.0, "E-TALEB is a structural project aiming at developing Lebanese Professional Standards in Teaching and Learning and cooperating for innovation and exchange of good practices and experiences relevant to similar frameworks established in Europe.The main objective of this project is to support the initial and continuing professional development of staff engaged in teaching and foster dynamic approaches to teaching and learning through creativity, innovation and continuous development in diverse academic disciplines and/or professional settings.

Further, it is hoped that this project will be a catalyst for further funding bids to facilitate the digitisation of the UACES archival materials.", "http://www.uaces.org", "UACES", "erasmus_574501-EPP-1-2016-1-UK-EPPJMO-PROJECT_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9HU", "THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES EMPLOYERS' ASSOCIATION LBG*UCEA", 366.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18674", 2016], ["9NA", "HELPAGE INTERNATIONAL LBG*HAI", 340995.0, "Disaster prevention, disaster risk reduction and preparedness (23.02.02)", "fts_2016_32105", 2016], ["9BB", "INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH LIMITED", 6177.0, "External trade relations, including access to the markets of third countries (20.02.01)", "fts_2016_52473", 2016], ["9NA", "AGE CONCERN LONDON", 33991.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (09.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_10039", 2017], ["8BU", "CONFLICT ARMAMENT RESEARCH LTD", 3030487.0, "Support to non-proliferation and disarmament (19.03.02)", "fts_2017_12106", 2017], ["9NE", "THE ROYAL NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF THE BLIND ROYAL CHARTER*RNIB", 148175.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_14311", 2017], ["9NA", "HELPAGE INTERNATIONAL LBG*HAI", 610577.0, "Delivery of rapid, effective and needs-based humanitarian aid and food aid (23.02.01)", "fts_2017_27454", 2017], ["9NA", "LAW CENTRES FEDERATION", 35508.0, "Ensuring the protection of rights and empowering citizens (33.02.01)", "fts_2017_38982", 2017], ["9BB", "INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH LIMITED", 6636.0, "External trade relations, including access to the markets of third countries (20.02.01)", "fts_2017_55898", 2017], ["9HQ", "UACES", 43613.0, "Promoting excellence in teaching and research activities in European integration through the Jean Monnet activities worldwide (15.02.02)", "fts_2017_57470", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "WC1H"}
