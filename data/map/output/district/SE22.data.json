Indeed, different European countries are showing opposite reactions and approaches to the issue which has not really found a convincing solution after the recent agreement with Turkey on 20th March 2016.On the one hand the dramatic situation of the asylum seekers and migrants moved the heart of many Europeans - among them, normal citizens, associations and volunteers showed greater sensitivity than their own governments. On the other hand, a parallel flow of diffidence, hatred, and hate speech grew and displayed how easily racism and xenophobia can grow at every level of society.As a matter of fact, this is the evidence that, even in Europe, human rights\u2019 awareness and defense, together with intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding, are crucial and urgent priorities.Within this framework, Greece is in the front line, with more than half million people transiting the country in 2015.

It aims at strengthening the participants' skills on human rights education in order to develop raising awareness and advocacy actions inside their organisations. It also aims at raising the local population awareness, especially the youth, and to develop advocacy to defend human rights and living together.

They also share good practises from their different organisations. A meeting with local organisations defending human rights and living together, give them an insight of the local context and allows them to discover new methods, tools and forms of mobilization to defend human rights.

The four EVS volunteers will assist in the daily tasks and thus gain experience of community living, while also participating in and and facilitating the different events held there. The main objectives are for the volunteers to assist with the programme of events to provide opportunities for discussion, intercultural understanding and learning, and for them to benefit as individuals from their participation so that they too gain a greater sense of human solidarity and develop the confidence to continue as active citizens.\r\n\r\nIn terms of context, Othona Bradwell is located in a beautiful coastal area of Essex, between the North Sea and the estuary of the River Blackwater. The community was established next to the chapel of St Peter, constructed on the ruins of a Roman fortress in the sixth century. From its beginning in 1946 as a summer camp in tents, Othona has grown to become a meeting place for people from different countries and backgrounds - it is a place of reconciliation where people come together to be refreshed, to take stock and to make friends through working and socialising together, learning new skills and gaining a greater understanding of each other\u2019s cultures and backgrounds. Examples of events recently held or planned at Othona include a residential study session on \"Exploring the Qur'an\", a seminar organised with Volunteer Action for Peace (VAP) on the topic of migration, and a \"Together beyond words\" reconciliation week bringing people from Palestine and Israel together. There are also events focused on environmental education, wildlife, art and music. The objective for the EVS volunteers' practical support for and participation in these events is to promote understanding and inclusion between different groups, especially in the context of intercultural and international solidarity and actively reducing xenophobia and conflict.\r\n\r\nThe second main activity that the volunteers will be involved in is co-ordinating short-term international residential projects elsewhere in the UK for a period of 3 weeks. These are workcamp projects that VAP organises annually with community organisations and arranges for international volunteers to take part in; examples include cultural festivals and community centres. By acting as coordinators for the group of international volunteers, the EVS volunteers will be able to further develop their skills as intercultural mediators and project coordinators. In addition, they will be trained to use a toolkit of non-formal activities during these short-term projects that have been designed to help people learn more, think more and act more about specific human rights topics, specifically with regard to migration and gender issues. The objective here is for the volunteers to develop experience of promoting active citizenship, respect for diversity, intercultural dialogue and solidarity. This aspect of the EVS volunteers' activities will also have a major impact on the quality of the UK workcamps, as the EVS volunteers will be fully trained, confident coordinators and thus raise the standard of international voluntary service in the UK.\r\n\r\nAn additional important activity that the volunteers selected for the project will participate in is contributing to VAP's public information events. As well as being able to find out about other aspects of international volunteering, the EVS volunteers will present on their experience of the EVS project so that UK-based young people can find out more about EVS themselves. The objective here is therefore to promote the benefits of the Erasmus+ programme to the wider population so that more people can be involved in the exchange and learning opportunities available. This will also allow other organisations in the UK who could benefit from hosting EVS projects to find out more about the programme and is intended to increase the number of EVS projects in the UK for young people to contribute to.\r\n\r\nIn total, there are therefore three main long-term impacts of this project. Firstly, the volunteers will support the programme of events held at Othona so that these seminars, visits and retreats are maintained at a high quality and allow more people to share ideas about the key topics of inclusion, intercultural exchange and human solidarity. With the EVS volunteers coming from different countries and backgrounds will expand the breadth of perspective offered at these events. Secondly, the volunteers themselves will develop unique intercultural awareness and experience in project coordination. Finally, the dissemination aspect of the project will increase awareness of EVS in the UK among young people and potential new hosting organisations.", "http://www.vap.org.uk", "VOLUNTEER ACTION FOR PEACE", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035301_coordinator"], ["0PH", "Seeding Peace Training for and Human Rights and Peace Trainers", "VOLUNTEER ACTION FOR PEACE", 15926.0, "The White Paper of International Voluntary Service 2011-2021, created as a result of a long-term participatory process, contains the vision and global strategies of the international voluntary service movement. Every CCIVS biannual Plan of Action is based on this document.\r\nDuring the General Assembly in 2012, the analysis of the results achieved in regards with the WP highlighted the fact that actions were done on Peace and Human Rights by CCIVS members in the past years but lacked the network umbrella and visibility; and also underlined the need to compile the many educational materials existing on the thematic. \r\nCCIVS members during the GA 2016 voted for the continuation of the Raising Peace campaign and to turn this into a Programme which would take place every year - with training, local actions and communication elements. As a result of a Conference organised by CCIVS in 2016 and held on anti-radicalisation and violent extremism the CCIVS members upheld that the actions they implement locally are the best way to continue to try to access ' at risk' groups and to integrate them within local projects. The partners of this activity are all very active within the overall CCIVS Raising Peace programme and organise hundreds of projects each year which aim to include and provide the space for young people to participate in grassroots worthwhile projects focusing on community needs. \r\nTaking into account the situation in the world today where there is an increased divide and fear between people living in the same country, greater numbers of young people are without space for participation - we aim to break this down by training 21 young trainers from 11 different organisations specifically in the field of peace and human rights education so they may gain new skills but also tranfer this to their local communities with an intended oureach of 200 people in each locality and to provide information about this to millions via the communication surrounding the overall Raising Peace programme of which the training makes part. \r\n.\r\nThe main aim of this activity is to empower young activists with HRs and Peace education competencies necessary to\r\nrun Raising Peace activities. Participants going through this process will be invited to join the Pool of Trainers (PoT), consisting of experienced trainers in the field of HRs and Peace and to support future Raising Peace events open for the IVS movement\r\nThe sessions proposed to participants will provide an understanding of the general context of human rights, specific training skills and inspirations on how to improve the visibility of related initiatives. For this reason, the objectives of the training will be:\r\n\u2022 to consolidate participants\u2019 knowledge on Human Rights Education and on the contributions of the IVS on the promotion of Peace and human rights;\r\n\u2022 to acquire tools, methods and techniques to design and implement intercultural projects focused on human rights and Peace;\r\n\u2022 to improve teamwork skills, intercultural communication, cooperation;\r\n\u2022 to provide participants with communication tools for the promotion of their actions, initiatives and projects related to human rights and Peace\r\n\r\nTo respond to these objectives CCIVS will implement a Training for Trainers to take place in Afacan, Turkey from the 5-9 September 2018. The choice of Turkey as a host country is a way to support a region and an organisation deeply affected by recent dramatic events, which had a negative impact on the voluntary exchange and on the implementation of local projects. The number of incoming volunteers and participants in Turkey has considerably decreased over the last two years, therefore to organise the event with the CCIVS member in Turkey Gen\u00e7tur will produce a positive impact on the organisation and it will be a way to encourage other organisations to send activists and volunteers in the region.\r\n\r\nNFE methodology will be used throughout the project,  which we consider to be extremely important for integration and understanding between cultures. We will also use technology to give a real-time feedback of the results of the activities.\r\n\r\n1000+ young people in local communities will benefit from the activities implemented by the trained multipliers promoting non-violence and intercultural dialogue. Over 20 youth workers will gain new tools and expertise for their personal and professional growth and will take this back to their sending organisations. 11 Youth organisations directly involved in this project from 8 countries and 20+ institutions contacted via the communication campaign will benefit from the development of this project and from the sharing of the results. \r\nThis project is a concrete step towards intergrating young people at risk of exclusion on a local level and of raising awarness about this situation externally, the activity will provide a platform for the discussion and exchange and all information will be widely diffused and will show the important support of the E+ programme.", "http://www.vap.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-FR02-KA105-013633_5"], ["0PH", "Life across the fences", "Volunteer Action for Peace", 22512.0, "Massive migration flows triggered a severe and multifaceted crisis in Europe. Indeed, different European countries are showing opposite reactions and approaches to the issue. On the one hand the dramatic situation of the asylum seekers and migrants moved the heart of many Europeans - among them, normal citizens, associations and volunteers showed greater sensitivity than their own governments. On the other hand, a parallel flow of diffidence, hatred, and hate speech grew and displayed how easily racism and xenophobia can grow at every level of society. As a matter of fact, this is the evidence that, even in Europe, intercultural dialogue and mutual understanding together with human rights\u2019 awareness and defense are crucial and urgent priorities.\r\nLife across the fences aims to empower youth workers and leaders of IVS organisations to deal with the topic of migration by increasing intercultural awareness and aims at improving active participation and commitment among youth.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we set the following objectives:\r\n- To promote mutual understanding and constructive debate among the participants by encouraging them to approach intercultural dialogue with tolerance and open-minded attitude;\r\n- To bring the participants to an active reflection on the topic through non-formal education activities and experiential learning;\r\n- To empower the participants - and through them other actors in their communities of origin - by strengthening their skills, in particular the ones needed to organize projects, raising awareness actions and events at local, national and international level; \r\n- To introduce Youthpass as a tool for self-assessment, evaluation and recognition of non-formal learning \r\nThe 30 participants and an organising and support team of 6 people will be from Hungary, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, Greece, Spain, UK. The participants will be youth workers, leaders and volunteers of partner organisations of the IVS networks, who intend to widen their toolkit that better responds to the challenges of xenophobia among youth.  The activities will be a combination of exercises raising intercultural awareness and dialogue, learning about migration and human rights of migrants, political dimension of youth projects, raising awareness action and project development.\r\n\r\nWorking methods are designed according to the principles of experiential, non-formal learning in a multicultural context. The following working methods will be used during the activities of the TC: short interactive presentations by the trainers, presentations led by participants, facilitated discussions and brainstorming in plenary and in small groups, facilitated reflection groups to monitor and support the individual learning, activities in mixed nationality groups, couples, trios and individually followed by a debriefing, icebreakers, games and role play, artistic expression, artistic expression, video projection, interactive art gallery, opinion line, forum theatre, panel discussion, individual reflection, facilitated group reflection and evaluation.\r\n\r\nDeveloping an open-minded attitude to intercultural awareness and sensitivity will enable participants to respond to the growing xenophobic phenomena in their countries. Organising awareness raising actions contributes to active youth participation, developing future projects to increase intercultural dialogue will enhance international development co-operation between IVS organisation in the topic of migration. \r\nThe expected benefit is that partners can offer diverse activities under Raising Peace Campaign, which allows them to involve and engage young people on the long-term, as well as to reach new target groups. Young people develop a responsible attitude towards diversity. Moreover, the recognition of non-formal learning and international mobility as a tool of learning increases in the local communities.", "http://www.vap.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-HU01-KA105-036130_1"], ["0PH", "IVS for Climate Justice Don\u2019t just say it!
