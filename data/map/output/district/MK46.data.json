This should encourage the awareness of its potential among the young generations and of the need to train professionals so that they could make the history and fortunes of the hospitality industry in the area. Also, there is a need to open the way to some places along the winding road of tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an age in which students graduating from HEI are called to make a lifestyle choice, it is even more necessary to have an exchange of real information on the quality and effectiveness of their studies as well as on the real employment opportunities on the labour market, especially the local one. \r\n\r\nThe proximity to the local tourism industry, the demand for skilled professionals in tourism enterprises and the opportunity for graduates to access the labour market, immediately after their graduation, highlight the importance and effectiveness of the attendance of VET Institutes focused on environment and tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this perspective, the Municipality of Vietri sul Mare promotes the sectorial mobility project \"T.U.R.I.AR.T-Training Opportunities for young gRaduated In ARt and Tourism\" for the implementation of 50 internships in EU in the field of tourism and environmental heritage promotion and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is addressed to 50 recent graduates entering the labour market who on the date of the notice publication satisfy the following requirements: age of majority; Italian citizenship; residence in the Campania Region; status of unemployment/inactivity and full civil and political rights; good command of the host Country language; VET school-leaving certificate in one of the following disciplines: administration and marketing, environment, agriculture, agribusiness and rural development, food and wine, hospitality, craft and industrial production, commercial business; \r\n\r\nWith the same score, priority will be given to young people residing in one of the towns of the Amalfi Coast participating in the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will last 24 months (from July 1st 2014 to June 30th 2016). The 120-days internships will be implemented between January 2015 and May 2016 in the following Countries: Spain, United Kingdom, and Malta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring their stay abroad, beneficiaries will be supported by Vietri City Council, local partners and receiving organisations through the provision of the following services:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 definition of the training plan; \r\n\r\n\u2022 flight booking;\r\n\r\n   airport meet and greet;\r\n\r\n\u2022 accommodation in the city of destination; \r\n\r\n\u2022 insurance coverage for workplace accidents and civil liability; \r\n\r\n\u2022 supply of a pocket money to cover the subsidence expenses (food) and local transports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy increasing the professional skills of human resources, the project aims to promote and develop tourism  industry in the Amalfi Coast and to disseminate practices and methodologies implementing a kind of sustainable development. It also seeks to promote and develop a kind of \"European culture of tourism\", creating positive synergies between local professionals\u2019 prior knowledge and the different experiences and techniques of the European Countries involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of these considerations, the project T.U.R.I.AR.T represents one of the auspicious actions, as it refers both to the beneficiaries of the grant, who will improve their professional skills, and to the local area they belong, which will indirectly benefit from the raising awareness and project promotion processes, as well as from the know how of the participants, as workers in the sector, who will transfer the innovative practices and preservation processes learned during their work experience abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese general purposes correspond to the following specific purposes referred to the participants: to foster professional growth and improvement of language and social skills, projecting recent graduates in the European Union context and focusing the mobility action on the improvement of their skills in the field of tourism and environment; to promote transnational exchanges among young professionals in the sector; to form a skilled labour force in the field of tourism marketing and promotion.", "http://www.languagestays.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA102-000188_12"], ["4DH", "Grant for Learning Opportunities in european Countries Aimed at promoting Local development", "LanguageStays Limited", 595497.0, "The project  G.L.O.C.A.L (Grant for Learning Opportunities in european Countries Aimed at promoting Local development) refers to the context of Campania region, which stands out to be the Italian region with the lowest GDP per capita (less than \u20ac 16,500) and the highest number of young people who do not study nor work nor seeking work (nearly 600,000 NEET - \"Not (engaged) in Education, Employment or Training\"), due to the lack of confidence in a better future and to the highest youth unemployment rate in Italy (51, 5%). \u2013 (Svimez 2013)  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Campania has a business system composed of medium, small and micro enterprises characterized by a difficulty in attracting adequately skilled human resources. Thus, acting as a driving force for the economic development of the region is a very hard mission to accomplish for them, although there are peaks of excellence in the  manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, G.L.O.C.A.L. will seek to promote the development of the local area through the qualification of its human resources, in order to pursue the following purposes: \r\n\r\n\u2022 to promote a new model of training on the job based on the needs of the local productive fabric;\r\n\r\n\u2022 to involve different types of actors in order to create local and international networks and to create synergies for development and competitiveness, to create new international business relationships and to improve existing ones, with a positive impact on the entire territorial community, in terms of increasing employment rates; \r\n\r\n\u2022 to improve transparency and recognition of qualifications and competences; \r\n\r\n\u2022 to encourage foreign languages learning with particular reference to micro-languages;\r\n\r\n\u2022 to facilitate job matching in order to develop the European labour market;\r\n\r\n\u2022 to strengthen the concept of European citizenship and the mobility of human resources, as repeatedly pointed out and recommended by the European Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is open to 100 recent graduates from VET schools residing in the Campania Region, and aims to support the arrangement of work experience placements in companies located in the following Countries: Spain, United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium.\r\n\r\nGlocal will manage all the project phases in order to support the participants, taking charge, either directly or through partners, of the management of part of the grant on behalf of the participants. In particular, the support provided to the trainees includes the following services:\r\n\r\n\u2022 selection of the host companies and definition of the training plan; \r\n\r\n\u2022 airport meet and greet;\r\n\r\n\u2022 accommodation in the city of destination; \r\n\r\n\u2022 insurance coverage for workplace accidents and civil liability; \r\n\r\n\u2022 supply of a pocket money to cover the subsidence expenses (food) and local transports (if not covered by the host company);\r\n\r\nWith reference to the expected outcomes concerning the improvement of professional skills, the project G.L.O.C.A.L will make trainees \u201cexperience\u201d the European labour market and it will implement training activities in accordance with the productive fabric needs; thus providing an important added value to those people enhancing their professional skills under these requirements.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the improvement of personal and cultural skills (including linguistic preparation), the 120-days-work experience abroad will make trainees achieve and develop a good knowledge of the host Country lifestyle. Also, it will give them the opportunity to approach the so called \"microlanguages\", in this case the technical language used in Business Management, as well as local slang and idioms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project G.L.O.C.A.L. will have a major impact in terms of partnership, consolidating and extending those collaborations which are prior to the project itself, and thus already strenghtened, at least with respect to most of the Italian partners. \r\n\r\nWith reference to the dissemination measures, Glocal, together with all the partners involved in the project, intends to implement a strategy of dissemination of the project\u2019s outcomes in all of its phases. The main aim of the strategy is to disseminate the expected \u201cproduct\u201d of the mobility, represented by the skills gained by the participants as well as by \u201cthe processes relating to the management and organization of the training, the partnership and the project itself\u201d.
