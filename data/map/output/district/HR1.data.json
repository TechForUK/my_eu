Both are providers of education and training to students with visual impairment with a residential component with cohorts from 16-25 who are \"younger adult learners\" studying academic and vocation routes to formal qualifications from entry level to university entrance and preparation for the workplace.  Our differences lie in approaches to core skills of independent living, (which for any acquired visual impairment have to be learned anew)  and the expectation of more intense and longer work placements as students put their learning into practice.   Whilst RNCB has short term engagements with older students , CSRP has Ecole, Lycee and College, and in the older group include sighted students, a different dimension culturally. Initial engagements came from chance meeting of two senior staff who appreciated the similarities and saw how, if approached effectively synergy could bring huge benefit to the organisations, the individuals working therein and most importantly to students. Visual impairment brings challenges to both formal and informal learning as the individual is not able to observe and imitate both in their early years or as a young adult,  and access to print and so to information is compromised. Even with effective working medium through braille or technology solutions students take longer to complete qualifications and for example will often have 100% time allowance in examinations where they may use a reader and scribe. this is also extremely stressful and tiring. In moving on to work, a new set of challenges and competencies need putting in place and reinforcing purely to access the workplace, and to acquire integrate and operate suitable equipment and software to demonstrate their abilities. The project will involve approximately 50 students and 10 staff and many volunteers in each of the two colleges by using aspects of the various activities in cross college and specific accredited curriculum linked work, some of this will be collaborative and over the extent of the project allied to to exchange aspects such as recruitment and selection, interview techniques and practical work placements. Four staff from each college have a particular role in investigating or offering aspects of their work where we think the partner may have much to teach us or to gain from our practices, and this will continue to shape the project beyond the first year and hopefully into future engagements. There is potential for investigating and developing outreach beyond the colleges. The present project continues these themes of making and taking opportunities to demonstrate ability, to evidence \"Growing Respect and Opportunities in the Workplace and in the Home for Visually Impaired People\" as ambassadors for themselves for our college communities, for visually impaired people everywhere (in UK only 33% of people with Vi are ever employed and many do not sustain this for more than a year). On a different scale the project allows participants as students and teachers, and workplace providers to explore and foster an international dimension, and to discover varied cultural habits and practices, attitudes and misconceptions, and to move through and beyond these through friendship and cooperation, professional interchange and challenge for everyones betterment.The extended nature of this three year project allows for greater depth and continuity, and broadening of the topic areas to be considered and taken further even beyond the remit of the project.  Having found a partner with a similar brief makes so many aspects more secure when dealing with vulnerable students by virtue of their core disability of visual impairment, as both partners are familiar with this and the environments are appropriately managed.  We seek to prove that by working towards successful work placements both our ambassador students from either side of the channel and their employers will acquire new found confidence in managing in the workplace regardless of disability and appropriate adaptations to access modes finding they have reliable, effective, valuable and loyal workers who fit in and complement the business.", "http://www.rnc.ac.uk", "Royal National College for the Blind", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024435_coordinator"], [2015, "Transports et travail accessibles \u00e0 tous", "Royal National College for the Blind", 34145.0, 2, 2, "The aim of this programme is to establish a UK - France link and increase global citizenship by  sending twenty young people - some of them  visually impaired-  to the UK to do  a work placement.

The aim is to develop an equitable and sustainable partnership lasting twenty-four months with two periods dedicated to internships. Thus , the students/pupils following a B-tech in Business Studies in our vocational school will be able to do their work placements abroad developing both their language and professional skills. A number of activities will be carried out before the internships take place. Visually impaired students need to orientate themselves on new premises so as to be able to find their way, especially in British   public transports . A collaborative study will enable  the students to compare accessibility in public transports in both countries. Peer guidance will be experienced during a stay in Hereford prior to the work placement period. A collaborative study of  legislation concerning disability  in the workplace in both countries will  be carried out. A comparative study of adapted workstations in companies will also be carried out. It will help students change their preconceptions on the working conditions of the disabled in the working world. This will lead us to work in collaboration with our partners  in the Royal National College as they are experts in adapting the workstation. They will install specific material (adapted software, JAWS...) which is indispensable for our students in their work placements. \r\n\r\nThe close working relationship between teachers in the two schools  is necessary for the professional experience of our students as trainees in British companies to be successful.  Working together to help and support visually impaired students in both countries contributes to enriching education and it will help our project to develop successfully.\r\n\r\nA partnership committee including adults and students from the two schools will define the different steps of the programme.

Youth In Action project, ran by CH and IES in 2013. Employment was one of the key issues that young people raised in the reasons why people would leave their rural area. IES and Close House want to bring together young people to look at the world of employment further and how it can positively change an area. Both partners also want to give project participants opportunities and time to explore for themselves the benefits of work, both personally and within a community. The primary purpose of this program is to develop the participants sense of purpose to engage fully in life. 'Work', in the context of the project title, is striving to achieve, rather than employment, although employment may be where participants decide they want to achieve. A mutual enforcing objective, increased confidence, is a further goal. Running this project as an international event we plan to expose young people to varying cultural attitudes about employment, given population change in the relevant localities particularly important, and fulfill our third objective of building cultural understanding.\r\n\r\nThis project will be ran with young people that;  due to their age, geographic location and social circumstances, are at risk of becoming Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET). They are especially in need of developing their sense of purpose and confidence in order to engage fully in their lives. Due to recent population and social change, they are also in need of developing tolerance and understanding with other cultures. The project will take place with equal number of participants from Hereford and Olawa, each party with two supporting staff and eight young people, to make a total of twenty project participants.\r\n\r\nActivities to take place will be centered on self evaluation, developing understanding and exposure to new experiences.\r\nThe first aspect of this will be visits to places of employment. We have four visits planned around the country visiting very different workplaces with differing community impacts. The first stage to employment, forms and interviews, is intimidating to those leaving formal education and this project will show them the exciting possibilities and stories behind what can be an off-putting introduction. Through our workshops we plan to solidify the learning experience of the factory visits and have participants discuss how employment fits in to their lives. \r\n\r\nThe Second aspect is to develop the confidence of participants. This is the background to all the activities and runs through the entirety of the project. As well as having their contributions and work valued within the core activities, participants will be encouraged to actively engage with the project and turn it into their own creation. Ownership of the 'Work Works for Me' project takes many forms.  Surveying members of the general public, the film project to be shown at the end and team games will all be key project moments participants can demonstrate their abilities and grow confident in their achievements.\r\n\r\nThe final aspect of the project is to develop cultural understanding. The young people will be encouraged to work and play in groups that increases interaction between these different cultures, and through these working partnerships and teams, friendships will develop that outlast the longevity of the project. To add to this understanding, participants will have a dedicated night to display examples of their own culture and feel pride in where they are from while appreciating any differences.\r\n\r\nBuilding the participants understanding about the world of work may ultimately make them choose to seek employment, further education or vocational training and all those paths, not only employment, would be justifiable. Through this experience we plan to have participants take time to reflect on their own feelings to make decisions about the path of their life, not necessarily only valuing employment. We also envisage a positive change in community feeling towards new migrants as participants enter back into their communities with positive stories to tell of their friendships formed through the exchange between England and Poland.

The work life requires new kinds of competencies and even if there are fewer financial resources available for education VET must be able to provide the labour market with students that have the needed new competencies. One way of being able to do this is for VET and work to collaborate and thus respond more swiftly to changes in work life and operating environment and in adapting to individual competence needs. This is why VET in Europe is more and more stressing the importance of collaborations between VET providers and working life. This has resulted in a need to do develop tools and methodologies that helps VET providers and employers as well as other potential stakeholders set up systematic pedagogical collaborations where students\u2019 skills and competencies are developed in various work-based settings. Our main target groups and beneficiaries are the VET providers and employers. Other beneficiaries are VET students and municipalities and the labout market in general. \r\n\r\nVET@Work will address the following topics:\r\n1. Cooperation between educational institutions and business \r\n2. New innovative educational methods\r\n3.

All work will be done together in order to develop an online manual that will provide the users with information on how to set up pedagogical communications and evaluate learning environments.\r\nThe outcome of the project is an Online Manual for implementing innovative ways of collaborating with the labor market when educating students within VET. The manual will consist of 5 chapters. Chapter 1:  General information why collaboration between VET providers and employers is neede. Chapter 2: Descriptions of the 12 selected best practices (includes step-by-step instructions on suggestions for implementation). Chapter 3: Benefits from the VET providers aspect. Chapter 4: Benefits from the Employers aspect. Chapter 5: Employer VET Self Evaluation Tool.

The need for AppMentor in VET has arisen as an increasing  partof the learning is conducted during work based learning and during  workplacements away from the VET provider. Sometimes it is impossible to travel to the companies and have mentoring sessions on the spot. Many work mentors & mentoring teachers already see the benefits of using mobile technology in mentoring.  Also reporting and registering is already done online in many sectors of industry and service.

VMA in Iceland, Charlottenlund in Trondheim,  Norway and Axxell in Finland, are vocational colleges offering many types of vocational study.  Jules Rieffel is an agricultural college in France working with small workplaces in agriculture.  The consultants, IFSAT in the Netherlands, also connected with a re-integration program for young unemployed, and Broadshoulders in England, have been involved in developing many different things in vocational education, particularly the role of workplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe need for this project has been identified when evaluating the WorkMentor project. This was the 3rd in a series of projects dealing with the learner in the workplace using a portfolio of evidence to report on his learning progress (ProVoTrain project), a project for the support to and teaching of VET teachers who needed professional adaptation to blended learning (PO\u00c8TE project) and the WorkMentor project which developed training packages for work mentors guiding learners in the workplace. During this evaluation it was felt that a solid support structure, a framework of agreements, arrangements and matching documents, could increase the efficiency of the learning placement and clarify the role of each of the three parties in the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of the project is to develop a system of processes, sheets, forms and inspections to use with workplacements that can be incorporated into the quality management systems vocational colleges or other providers work with. This is directly linked to the efforts of the European Commission when developing tools to use when comparing and cooperating within the scope of vocational education.  ECVET, EQF and other tools have been established to facilitate the flow of students and qualified workers.  The EC has furthermore allocated funds towards development of international relations and connections in education through it's Lifelong Learning Programme, the Leonardo da Vinci for VET and more recently throught the ERASMUS+ program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe WorkQual project will collect information on which aspects different stakeholders want to discuss when looking at learning in the workplace.  The partners will host meetings with local stakeholders and collect the viewpoints from six countries, comparing the different situations and designing a common practice when placing students in workplaces.  \r\n\r\nThis common practice will be written into the processes and documents used at each college and inspected as a part of the Quality Management System of each college. \r\n\r\nThe final major output will be a system integrated into each country's system and rooted in the general European system proposed in the European tools. This will be made publicly available on a dedicated website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the belief of the partnership that this system for working with students in workplaces is of great importance now when many countries have been working on their vocational education systems.  Often the responsibility of training in the workplace is placed on the colleges.  This calls for a structure and a transparent system to use when placing students in workplaces and monitoring their competence.\r\n\r\nEven if many countries have good structure for this they are not taking the role of workmentors in the workplace into account.   \r\n\r\nThe general assumption is that there are three responsible partners involved: a college/provider, a workplace and the student.  The system must take this into account so the education will be manageable for the college, not a burden for the workplace and it will be relevant and inviting for the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal is to develop a system that can be used in many sectors.  \r\n\r\nEven if there are different competences to gain in the workplace for different vocations there are general factors involved in the success of students.  How can we match the student to the most suitable workplace?  What does the underlying agreement look like? How can we support the students during workplacements? How can we evaluate the student without expecting workplaces and students to deliver lengthy reports?  Will the workplacement be valuable for the student when entering the vocation?

From this, the children will be able to access methods that they can recall and implement or identify opportunities where they could utilise their knowledge. As a result, the children and staff will become more capable of handling stressful situations. Thus, giving pupils the skills to move forward through their teenage and adult years and staff to cope with the stresses and strains of everyday life.\r\nThrough the variety of activities that have been arranged and designed, the maximum number of participants have been catered for, no matter what their economic, academic, social, religious or cultural backgrounds. Across the consortium of schools, the project will aim to meet the needs of almost 4000 pupils. In addition to this over 200 staff will benefit from the instruction and benefits of the project.\r\nThrough the project, the children will be able to identify where there food comes from and the societal pressures that individuals have upon them when it comes to dietary choices. Through the identification of these, and the sharing of them with parents and stakeholders, they will be able to make a positive impact on the balance within their choices made. They will be able to develop their language skills and apply their knowledge of technology to disseminate their knowledge and ideas on how they have embedded their understanding of the areas covered. \r\nBy using a variety of approaches, the children will have the opportunity to learn in a variety of ways and therefore encourage the maximum amount of participation no matter of their ability. Also, the inclusion of mobilities for the project allows the opportunities for children and staff to benefit from witnessing first hand how other schools, communities and societies live. They will have the cooperate and work together on projects and communicate first hand on a variety of projects that encompass a range of teaching and learning styles. We aim to de-stigmatise mental issues and provide the opportunities and experiences for all our young people to have happy and healthy lifestyles and provide them with the tools to achive this.\r\nThe conclusion of the project will result in a range of findings that can be shared on a variety of platforms: through the school, higher education establishments and via the EST portal. \r\nUltimately, the outcomes envisaged will contribute to healthier and more balanced individuals. they will be more able, moving forward, to make choices that are in their own, their families and societies interest, allowing for a longer, healthier  happier and more productive life.", "http://www.mordifordceprimaryschool.co.uk", "St Georges CE Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036654_4"], [2017, "EN MARCHA (Aprende, ense\u00f1a, comparte y gana)", "Mordiford CE Primary School", 28803.0, 3, 4, "Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n Elementary and Primary Education School, with 34 teachers and 358 students, is located in Toledo, in the neighborhood of Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia. The students come from diverse social extraction families: some with university education, others with socio-economic and cultural deprivation situations, ethnic minorities and immigrants. About 22% of the students suffer some type of problem such as school truancy, behavior problems, school mismatch, etc. Our center has for years applied an integrated curriculum that fuses the contents of the British National Curriculum and those of the Spanish Curriculum, derived from the signing of the Agreement between the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science and the British Council. Our aim of center when requesting this action of mobility for 2 years is to promote the enthusiasm of the teachers to continue forming and improving their linguistic and methodological competences to enhance our teaching quality. The objectives set for this purpose are: * To improve linguistic competence through observation and training activities in a more globalized educational and cultural context. * To deep in the knowledge of tools and methodologies that favor the integration of non-linguistic contents using a foreign language as Vehicular language * Know and compare educational models to improve our teaching work and achieve successful teaching-learning experiences, in which students enjoy learning and develop attitudes of acceptance and respect for others, promoting interculturality in our center. The application of new technologies in our teaching practice to motivate students and make them participants in their learning process * Exchange educational experiences with teachers and students of the visited center promoting interculturality through new technologies. The students and teachers the consciousness of belonging to the EU as a site for personal and work development. Our team member in this project consists of 19 teachers of Infantile and Primary Education with different level of linguistic competence, that go from A1 to C1 of English. Through this project we have proposed to work a set of activities such as participation in language training courses, CLIL methodology training courses and new technologies, training courses in Montessori methodology and a jobshadowing process in 3 centers in 2 countries (UK, Denmark). The methodology to be followed throughout the project will be based on experience and direct observation to foster the critical spirit, and will be carried out in a cooperative way  by the whole cloister. This will be achieved through language courses, focused on a communicative approach, and jobshadowing, with which we will cover aspects such as school organization, curriculum, space distribution, ... To take to the classroom everything we learned will use one Methodology based on meaningful learning, starting from the level of knowledge of our students and progressively moving towards more complex learning. It will also take into account the principles of educational intervention (socialization, globalization, family-school collaboration, motivation, intuition, autonomy, ability to learn to learn ...) Achieving the proposed objectives will have a short, medium and long impact Term of the entire Educational Community. In this way the teaching staff will improve the linguistic competence,  we will deep in the new methodologies mentioned above and we will boost the team work, which will result in an increase of the motivation and the improvement of its working system. The improvement of the linguistic competence of the teaching staff will revert to the students, who will participate in active and more motivating methodologies that will imply a greater involvement in their learning process in addition to a greater knowledge of the European dimension and an intercultural reinforcement that will broaden their horizons. In the Center, the Language Program will be strengthened, the team work of the faculty will be strengthened, sharing its knowledge with the rest of the teachers and drawing common lines of work for the application of such learning, thus revalorizing the concept of unity and the image of the Center on the outside. Long-term benefits: create a Strategic Action Plan in the methodological scope with objectives and deadlines for its achievement; Improved English proficiency; Intercultural knowledge or exchange; Awareness of the European dimension and identity; Of continuing teacher training beyond the framework of the project itself and participation in future European projects.", "http://www.mordifordceprimaryschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036419_1"]]}}}}
