The partnership will focus on sharing, developing and transferring innovative practices in education between the participating schools.\r\nThe project will focus on equipping our children with SKILLS FOR THE FUTURE OF EUROPE, to ensure that they are prepared for employment. \r\nThe project will aim to raise aspirations in our children at a time when they are still young enough for this to impact on their future employment potential. Many  children do not achieve as well as they should in subjects such as Maths and Literacy, Science and ICT unless they see WHY these skills are important. We will explain and demonstrate to them the need for working hard at these subjects in primary school, as this will be a good foundation for success at secondary (high) school, and for later careers, either academic or technical. We will also develop other skills needed for employment, including creativity, problem solving, teamwork, perseverance, character and resilience. Older students will act as mentors to younger children in developing workplace skills.\r\nStudies show that you have to interest children in the idea of university or college education early. We aim to impact on attitudes towards all aspects of education and training for employment.\r\nOurs will be a practical project with local business to engage those children who do not attain as well as they could because they do not fully understand the lifelong implications of learning .\r\nThe partnerships is composed of five schools serving varied communities and age ranges(from Kindergarten to secondary school) in the UK, Poland, Germany, Turkey, and Italy. Some of the partner schools have prior experiences of successful Comenius projects which focused on areas of learning including music and literacy, and healthy, active lifestyles. Some of the partners are new to Comenius, and will benefit from the experience of the rest of the group in working collaboratively across Europe.\r\nThe project will focus on making local links between schools and  businesses which are forward looking and innovative in creating employment and economic success. Through this contact the students will develop skills of entrepreneurship which they will apply in their own choice of enterprise. Throughout the project, the students will share their experiences with each other, their own school community,partner schools and the wider community. Their progress and engagement will be monitored closely to measure the impact on attitudes to learning and understanding of the relevance of key skills to future employment.", "http://www.st-johns-wetleyrocks.staffs.sch.uk", "St Johns CofE (C) School, Wetley Rocks", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000256_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ST9"}
