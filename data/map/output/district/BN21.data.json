Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage. The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.sussexdowns.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_18"], [2018, "NEXT Uddannelse K\u00f8benhavn mobility", "Sussex Downs College", 219412.0, 7, 13, "The overall objective of the project is to be seen as part of the school's strategy NEXT 2020, which strives for better education for more in a valuable cooperation with the outside world.\r\nNEXT will help to improve teachers and counselor qualifications, so that they have stronger abilities to work with internationalization within their respective fields.

As we offer LDV stays for students, teachers and staff, it is a good opportunity to anchor internationalisation in the different departments of the school, along with the other international activities which make globalization sustainable and meaningful to both students and staff at the institution.\r\n\r\nThe past years the school has sent our Upper secondary and Vocational education students abroad in work placements after graduation. We consider LDV stay as a good tool to enhance the participants cultural, linguistic and personal skills in relation to succeed as Work placement Abroad student later, likewise a LDV stay in general can help to highlight career paths in the participants' subsequent education. The vocational training and upper secondary students are offered a three week LDV stay in either Spain, Germany, the UK or Malta. The participants are offered internships within the field of retail and office work. Furthermore, all the partners in our application offer cultural activities as one of our main goals is to strengthen intercultural competences. Moreover, we want to strengthen the language output of our school\u2019s primary languages, English, German and Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe Participants represent two different departments at the school and students have different academic and personal needs. Therefore we have two different procedures. The most immediate difference of the two groups is that the vocational students only are offered Malta as a destination and an accompanying teacher always will travel with the students the first week of their stay. For the vocational training students, the goal is especially to give them more confidence regarding their second language training and on the personal level. An accompanying teacher will give the students the safety they need to make such a stay a success.\r\n\r\nFor both types of students the project's overall objective is that the students throughout their LDV-stay have a good experience abroad and gain great confidence in their professional and personal qualifications. A goal in itself is that after graduation a LDV stay can motivate the students to go abroad in work placement, which many  of the returned LDV students have already expressed in their internal evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe two coordinators are responsible for the project and have selected partnerships in the UK, Germany, Spain and Malta. The partnerships are chosen because they offer a wide range of companies for internships that can meet the needs of both types of students at KHS, and because they offer language school courses. The coordinators continually are in dialogue with partnerships in relation to monitoring and improving LDV stays.\r\n\r\nThe coordinators are also responsible for selection of participants, monitoring and evaluation of the LDV stays. Moreover, the coordinators also organize the cultural and linguistic preparation courses to make the students ready for the three-week stay. The coordinators have developed a process that ensures that all stages before, during and after LDV stays are implemented and evaluated in order to continuously develop the students LDV stay. The coordinators work with the school\u2019s marketing department to disseminate the results and experiences of the LDV participants both internally and in the surrounding media.\r\n\r\nAnother target group in this application is VETPRO participants. We have good experience with sending the professional staff on a 1 week VETPRO stay focused on inspiration and training. The coordinators bring together interested candidates twice a year for an information meeting together with the Vetpro participants who have already returned home. The goal is to create a platform for inspiration and knowledge sharing of VETPRO experiences. \r\n\r\nWe apply in this application for LDV stays for 90 Vet students and 2 accompanying teachers for the period 2014-2016. We have prior to this application sent 100 Vet students and 10 Vetpro professionals abroad. Therefore, we believe we can guarantee good student stays and competent partnerships abroad and hereby realizing the objectives of this application. \r\n\r\nLDV stays are an improvement of K\u00f8ge Business College's international profile and enhance internationalisation to be anchored in the school\u00b4s strategy for the benefit of the individual student and the school as an institution.", "http://www.sussexdowns.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA102-000080_5"], [2014, "International comparison of social and job-related life in Germany and Great Britain", "Sussex Downs College", 92779.0, 2, 2, "Initiated by Leo-von-Klenze-Schule, Staatliche Berufsschule II Ingolstadt, 35 students   take part in the project \u201eInternational comparison of social and job-related life in Germany and Great Britain\u201d.

It also gives us a competitive edge compared to upper secondary education in colleges providing general education. Continuation in creating this international profile is crucial. \r\n\r\nSignificant target are ...\r\n1) ... for learners: increasing the number of participating students and companies, consolidating the usage of standardized instruments for recognition (especially Europass mobility and ECVET), improving their design and facilitating their handling.\r\n2) ... for teachers: broader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education and training across countries,  implementing suitable practices from the partners in their own teaching and discussing adaptations in teachers' conferences, thus triggering changes in terms of modernisation and international opening within our college, strengthening the international orientation of our college and putting it on firm footing, especially by enlisting more colleagues in the execution of work placements abroad, exchange programmes and international projects. \r\n\r\n30 interested apprentices in dual business management training in internationally oriented companies will be picked for BRIDGES.  Teachers who are chosen for staff mobility are either already teaching in the BRIDGES or EBBD (European Business Baccalaureate Diploma) programme or seek to teach in these programmes or want to contribute to the internationalization of our college in another way, e.g. by creating new exchange programmes or projects of cooperation.\r\n\r\nBRIDGES comprises two different types of activities, each with a specific way of realization. \r\n1) work placements in social services providers in Worcester: Apart from several events for preparation in Germany that exceed lessons (e.g. project presentations by former participants, a seminar training of intercultural competences, information events about the organization of the work placements) learners will have special language lessons in Worcester preparing them for the new field of activity and the challenges that go with it. At the social services providers an employee will be assigned mentor of the interns. Once a week employees of our partner in Worcester will visit the interns at the social services providers for a mentoring talk. Activities reports will reflect the students' learning progress and will be sent to the German teacher responsible for that project once a week via email.  The students will reflect on their mobility by using an evaluation sheet based on ECVET criteria, stating the learning outcomes they will have achieved during their stay. These evaluation sheets will be discussed with their mentors at the social services providers and recognized by them. This evaluation will be completed by a presentation of the mobility's results to other apprentices in Germany. \r\n2) In Sussex apprentices and English students will plan, realize and evaluate a social project together. Additionally they will contribute to Sussex Downs College's school life by volunteer work. The instruments of documentation an evaluation mentioned above will be used accordingly.\r\n\r\nA crucial element of staff mobility is the further development of the European Business Baccalaureate's implementation. When staying with partner that already offer EBBD (Business College Helsinki and IBC in Vienna) concepts applied there will be compared to our concept. Aspects that might improve our own concept will be identified and documented. In Spain staff mobility will serve to transfer knowledge about the implementation of EBBD. Teachers going to ROC Horizon will not only contribute to the implementation of EBBD by adding the aspects of virtual mobility. A broader cooperation is intended, especially with regard to work placements of apprentices/students of both institutions. \r\n\r\nWith regard to our apprentices we expect increased social, communicative, personal and intercultural competences as well improved English language competences. From teachers we expect innovations in their teaching, contributions to the modernisation and international opening within our college, especially further cooperation in realizing work placements of apprentices abroad, student exchange programmes and international projects, thus increasing our college's attractiveness and strengthening the cooperation with our partners (local companies and university of applied sciences, regional colleges sending students to us, Rhineland-Palatinate project team of upper secondary education in VET colleges, continuation and extension of projects with our international partners, dissemination of EBBD).

One of the EBBD standards requires that students need to successfully complete a high-qualitative work placement abroad. As we do not have experiences with both - providing EBBD programmes  and organizing the required work placements - we need staff mobility for teachers, especially job shadowing in EBBD schools (Internationales Business College Hetzendorf/Wien and Andr\u00e1ssy Katolikus K\u00f6z\u00e9piskola in Hungary) or schools with a wide range of bilingual courses (e.g. IBB Niels Brock Business College, Copenhagen) and in organizations providing well organized and monitored work placements, which will be certified according to European standards (ECVET and Europass) by CSCS Pistoia, so that the participating students can meet the required standards and teachers can gain the necessary experience, improve their competences linked to teaching, provide a better quality of their work and activities for their students and increase the capacity to trigger changes in terms of modernisation and international opening within our college. We also hope they will further promote mobility activities for learners, increase their motivation and statisfaction in their daily work. A considerable boost of innovation is induced by participation at EfVET conferences (see vgl. http://www.efvet.org/), which is why we want to go to this year's conference in Porto. \r\n\r\nBesides EBBD in our upper secondary vocational education department we agreed upon mobility activities with one major local employer, BASF: apprentices for industrial clerks will work as interns in the social sector in order to gain soft skills in other areas than the ones provided by their professional background. That is why the project is called BRIDGES. This will be a first step towards increasing mobility of apprentices in our college. In this case we rely on partners in UK (Principia School for Language/Worcester and Sussex Downs College near Brighton) which are well experienced and connected to local chambers of commerce and companies, provide fitting work placements in the social sector and secure safe accomodation in host families. It is planned for 24 apprentices. Like CSCS with EBBD they will support, monitor and certify the students' work placements, newly implementing ECVET elements in this process. This mobility's focus is on developing personal and social competences as well as intercultural competences which could not be achieved during the students' apprenticeship. Besides students will increase their foreign language competences and employability. This also applies for the 4 students' EBBD work placements, who will be gaining initial work experiences abroad.\r\n\r\nAs our college does not have any experiences with work placements abroad yet, one teacher shall be trained at CSCS, job shadowing well experienced trainers and discussing the used instruments (matching tools, language and intercultural preparation, monitoring and certification of the mobilities according to ECVET instruments/Europass). Due to the ambitious standards which have to be met in EBBD (especially CLIL for working in companies (presentation, participation in meetings) and training of intercultural competences) and the extension/adjustment of CLIL-lessons at our college in this context, job shadowing of teachers in Copenhagen (IBB programme of Niels Brock Business College), in Vienna (International Business College Hetzendorf) and Hungary (Andr\u00e1ssy Katolikus K\u00f6z\u00e9piskola) are planned. \r\n\r\nWe want to achieve the implementation of newly acquired skills in EBBD-classes and bilingual programmes, the implementation of innovative teaching techniques whereever possible, sharing of experiences with colleagues and long-term fostering contacts with partner organizations, especially mentors, intercultural awareness \u2013 also for foreign students living in Germany  - (changing mind sets and attitudes), promotion of  mobility among both student and colleagues, encouraging more students to choose vocational instead of general upper secondary education because it provides better preparation for the job market and encouraging more students to go abroad for work placements, thus increasing their labour mobility, educating with more regard to international orientation and especially European participation based on the teachers\u2019 own experiences - creating awareness of European Citizenship and inducing more cross country cooperation.", "http://www.sussexdowns.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000345_6"], [2015, "Bridges", "Sussex Downs College", 25880.0, 2, 2, "The Bridges project seeks to share best practice across two VET organisations in the field of work experience and enterprise. \r\n\r\nBridges will enrich the Business curriculum for twenty  16-18 year old students offering them the unique opportunity to develop their enterprise and entrepreneurial skills with their German peers. \r\n\r\nDuring an exchange visit with our German partner, the students will benefit from a two-week placement that includes work experience with a German employer alongside the delivery of a social enterprise project.

D.I.C.K. was born after a careful analysis of the needs expressed by the members of the partnership and the examination of potential economic growth that Calabria territory could enable through a better training of its human resources and a better  marketing action for the positioning of food products in international market.\r\nThe Calabria region ( especially the territories  represented by the municipalities that are project partners) is characterized by an important agricultural and touristic potential. These territories despite their cultural and natural heritage, and the development of enogastronomic sector have been experiencing high rates of unemployment .\r\nThe region and the province of Reggio Calabria are not sufficiently able to enhance and promote their products. The high quality of products is not enough for the development if a marketing strategy is not implemented and  human resources are not really qualified.\r\nStarting from these considerations, MOB.Y. DICK was born to train adequate resources who can help face the challenges and opportunities coming from the global market and bring attention on agricultural and agri-food enterprises management. The objectives of the project are:\r\n1.To encourage a greater awareness of the opportunities that food industry can represent for territorial development;\r\n2.To train human resources able to answer global market modern needs;\r\n3.To work for a gradual and progressive adjustment of training systems according the real business needs, starting from the international experience and taking into account the European ECVET system of skills certification;\r\n4.To learn, through cooperation with foreign partners, good practices in the field of business management and marketing;\r\n5.To stimulate a greater dialogue among all stakeholders involved in the field of agribusiness and territorial development.\r\n\r\nMOB.Y. D.I.C.K. proposes a mobility period in Spain, United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland for 100 recent graduates who graduated in the following addresses: services for agriculture and rural development; or administration and marketing; or graphics and communications; and or tourism.\r\nBefore  their departure, participants will receive a pre departure preparation: \r\n- Support for the use of the linguistic platform;\r\n-identification of an individual professional development plan for each participant;\r\n- Cultural preparation and explication of the Erasmus+ Programme;\r\n- Presentation of the local area and its entrepreneurial and development opportunities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will improve technical knowledge and language skills, increasing their level of employability. Coming in contact with foreign companies and with different working styles, they will have the possibility to internationalize their curriculum and to acquire  knowledge for entering the European labor market . Their curriculum will be enriched by the Europass Mobility and other foreign certifications. Locally, the project will be an important opportunity for a territory that is characterized by an high level of youth unemployment. For recent graduates, it will represent an opportunity to apply the knowledge they learnt at school in a real labor experience functional to their career development.\r\nMoreover, the cooperation among various stakeholders involved in the area, will create greater synergy in order to join efforts in the promotion and commercialization of food and agriculture products. The comparison with the learners, once they get back, will represent a unique opportunity to compare different practices and to learn how foreign companies and territories have worked for the promotion of their own brands.\r\nMOB.Y. D.I.C.K. represents an opportunity to reflect on the professional figures that local territory needs. The cooperation between different partners (representing the field of education and training, institutional entities as employer realities) will allow to reschedule the training system so as to make it more suitable for local requirements.  The project aims to ensure that a 30% of the trainees will be offered an additional six-month internship in Italy. Of this 30%, it is estimate the recruitment of 20% of them. For 10% of the total of trainees, the project foresees the achievement of a contract abroad at the same companies that hosted them or in other realities. 10% of the beneficiaries are probably going to work on their own.

Each internship will last for 120 days, a duration necessary to guarantee to the trainees a complete professional experience and an enrichment from a personal perspective. The project proposal involves four types of partners: the applicant (project management and coordination and supervision of all of its phases and activities), participants (direct beneficiaries of the mobility activities), receiving organizations (the organization in charge of placements and the logistics of the participants in the host country) and local and foreign partners/host companies.The main objectives of the project are: meeting reasonable expectations for supplying the shortage of skills in the practical and operational disciplines studied; improving the ability to analyze, \u201cproblem solving\u201d and communication skills; improving and mastering the language listening and speaking skills; strengthening social skills and enriching their cultural background; promoting a model of \u201con the job\u201d training which starts from the empirical basis of the training needs of local production; improving the transparency and recognition of qualifications and skills; encouraging the learning of modern foreign languages with special reference to micro-languages; facilitating the matching demand and supply of labour, also in view of the development of a truly European labour market, with special reference to the tourism industry.In addition, since nowadays young people find it difficult to leave their families and live alone, it would include the need for many young people to make life experiences outside of the protective family environment.

The project, therefore, will have a concrete impact on the territory under two different points of view: the one of the participants, who will increase their employability skills, and that of the local economy, which can make use of highly qualified human resources, able to bring in the host companies practices and processes for success (best practices) that trainees will have learned in the course of the internship abroad.", "http://www.grandeastbourne.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005109_8"], [2018, "HLW lives Europe", "The Grand Hotel Eastbourne", 249361.0, 8, 30, "The development and objectives are divided into six priorities.\r\n1.

Public relations - dissemination of Erasmus + projects\r\n6. Getting to know and appreciate new living areas and cultures\r\n\r\n1. Quality Assurance:\r\nSchool education must be comparable with other vocational education and training systems. Educational objectives and learning outcomes and educational level of every single year must be must be exactly described. The allocation of ECVET points for the learning results must be carried out by a superior expert team uniformly for all schools; teachers of the HLW Rankweil are ready to be part of working teams.\r\nIt is planned to increasingly use the ECVET documents for documentation. So far, only the Learning Agreement and the Personal Transcripts have been applied, but additionally it is planned to complete the Memorandum of Understanding with the long-term project partners.\r\n\r\nSince the schoolyear 2017/2018 those students, who are going to absolve their practical training in Italy or Spain in the summer of 2018, have the possibility to register for the optional subject Italian or Spanish. \r\n\r\nMoreover, in the future it is planned to establish a partnership with experts in the fields of kitchen and service. Annually different teachers in different subjects are going to impart cultural knowledge about our partner countries. Besides the linguistic activities additional cooking and service workshops with foreign referents are going to be offered.\r\n\r\nTrainees convey new knowledge and impulses into the school routine. The teachers are challenged to slip the knowledge in their lessons\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of language certificates (DELF, BEC, DELE and CILS) and specialised certificates (boys' chefs and cheese chefs) increases the quality of the training and must be promoted and financially supported.\r\n\r\nMotivation of the pupils to participate in language competitions.\r\n\r\n2.Expansion of partnerships with foreign companies \r\nThe project team succeeded in winning new partners in Ireland and Italy. Thus, there is anetwork of 50 partner companies abroad.\r\n\r\n3. Social commitment\r\nWhen engaging in social services, pupils should show responsibility for the well-being of people in Europe. Our commitment for the project \u201cStreet Children\u201d in Romania and Bulgaria could be intensified.  A HLW graduate heads this project locally and she does that besides her University studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Strengthening the idea of the European Union\r\nStudents of fourth year are going to visit the EU Parliament in Brussels in the fall of 2018. EU experts are going to be invited to speak and hold workshops at our school. The EU Mobility Passes are going to be awarded in a special ceremony and during the ceremony the recipients are going to be informed about the meaning and importance of the European Union as an educational-, economic-and living area. \r\n5. Public relations \r\nIn addition to the print media also the social media will be used for the PR and the circulation of the project\r\n\r\n6. During language and culture weeks, the students are challenged to get to know new living areas and cultural sites in the European Union.\r\n\r\nCompared to previous years the number of participants has increased and in the summer of 2018, 89 or 90 students are going to absolve their mandatory internship abroad.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the quality of the foreign exchange program, cooperation with the companies has to be intensified and the process of the training has to be reflected.

They have the chance to experience a non-German-speaking working environment on the European labour market and to use and strenghten their acquired skills. \r\nThe aim of doing an internship in an EU-country outside Austria is to give our students the opportunity to \r\n- use their aquired knowlegde from school in subjects such as Business Studies, Accountancy, IT, Cooking and Service (which are important subjects in our type of school)\r\n- get some insight into the corporate structures of other countries \r\n- gain some job experience on the European labour market\r\n- improve their foreign language skills \r\n- improve their social skills and their sense of intercultural understanding\r\n- foster their personal development. \r\nThe target group for this programme are 17-year-old students (for the compulsory internship between years III and IV) and 18-year-olds (for the voluntary internship between years IV and V) who at this level have a fair knowledge of Business Studies and Accountance. Furthermore, all of them have been taught at least two foreign languages (English \u2013 B1+) and  (Italian or French  - B1) some of them are even learning  Spanish (Level \u2013 A2) as a third foreign language.

One of the major educational objectives of a vocational school providing higher education entrance qualifications like ours is to prepare our students for a working life where all the needs of modern economy and international business relations are considered. Moreover, the aspects of improving foreign language skills and getting familiar with business habits in other countries will be a major advantage for the young people who take part in this project.

Furthermore, within this project students will get the chance to get to know a country which they might not know at all or only from a short holiday. Another important aim is to improve their language skills \u2013 make use of what you already know, internalize it and expand your vocabulary, phrases, etc. Which skills are to be focused on, will be put down in the Learning Agreements in accordance with teacher, employers and students. During the training (accompanying persons, reports from students and mentors), that is, afterwards - the achievement of these goals will be checked. Additional ECVET aspects included in the project are: Personal Transcript and Memorandum of Understanding which are to be signed in the course of visits in the respective countries.Taking part in this project is therefore useful for the students in many respects. By working in a foreign countries they can consolidate their practical as well as their language skills, brush them up and enlarge them and that way increase their chance on the job market significantly. A further important aspect is that with the help of the Erasmus Plus project the students are to crack prejudices, become more open-minded and tolerant. And last but not least, participants are to become more mobile, even at an early age. The results of the project will be published by means of articles in local and regional newspapers, a radio interview is planned as well. Moreover, experienced project participants will pass their knowledge on to students who are thinking of going abroad in the following year at informative events at school but also outside of it.Staff mobility is another aspect that will be focused on this year. Four teachers are going to take part at the Summer Academy at Lanarkshire College in Scotland. Scottish-themed-cooking is the title of the seminar two English as well as two cooking teachers will participate in. The ultimate aim is to overcome language barriers and to finally design and hold classes together. In the long run bilingual education in the nutrion department of HLW should become part of the curriculum and give us an additional cutting edge in the future competition for students.", "http://www.grandeastbourne.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016559_5"]]}}, "4NN": {"cordis": {"data": [[1480550400000, 1527724800000, "Real-time Content Analysis and Processing (ReCAP) for Agile Media Production", "NMR Consultancy Ltd", "The media production industry is rapidly evolving and expanding globally, primarily driven by the explosion in mobile devices such as phones and tablets, the ubiquity of internet access and the subsequent demand to consume content anywhere, at any time and on any device.\nModern media production workflows must thus be agile and support multiple heterogeneous sources and playout targets in a responsive and cost-effective way.
