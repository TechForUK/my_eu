With half of the world\u2019s population currently living in urban centres, and with this figure set to increase to two-thirds by 2050, the issue of security and citizen safety is of paramount importance and a growing concern. In view of the growing number of threats from global terrorism, natural disasters or crime, urban planning practice must incorporate appropriate security measures for vulnerability identification and resilience enhancements.\nUrban planning is a process involving numerous stakeholders and multi-disciplinary teams. Although the use of software tools plays a significant role in this complex process, yet, none exist that take into consideration the security (and connected safety) aspects of urban planning as a whole.\nUrban planning teams need tools that fully encompass the pre-application process with developers/designers, and facilitate flexible solutions, not imposed measures. The objective of VITRUV is the development of software tools for the long and complex screening process, which is urban planning, moving across three levels from concept to plan to detail design. Based on an all hazard risk approach, the tools will enable planners\n\u2022 to make well-considered systematic qualitative decisions (concept level),\n\u2022 to analyse the susceptibility of urban spaces (e.g. building types, squares, public transport, and their functionalities) with respect to new threats (plan level), and\n\u2022 to perform vulnerability analyses of urban spaces by computing the likely damage on individuals, buildings, traffic infrastructure (detail level).\nAll levels (concept, plan and detail) will contribute to enabling the development of more robust and resilient space in the field of urban (re)planning/(re)design/(re)engineering. Planners who use VITRUV\u2019s tools will be able to deliver urban space less prone to and less affected by attacks and disasters, thus sustainably improving the security of citizens", 60187.0, 3800321.0, "VITRUV", "High-tech urban planning fosters security", "New software tools now under development are set to support urban planners and government officials in enhancing security across European towns and cities.", "A high standard of living depends to a large extent on a safe and secure urban environment, representing a vision that the EU is eager to realise in all its cities. The EU-funded project 'Vulnerability identification tools for resilience enhancements of urban environments' (VITRUV) is developing software tools for urban planners to further the viability of urban projects, designs and concepts. In particular, a set of Internet-compatible tools is assisting urban planners and city administrators to assess security weaknesses and propose solutions, rendering the urban environment much more resilient.\n\nThe software in question is framing urban security issues in relation to urban planners' decisions regarding spaces, including economic, ethical, social, safety and mobility considerations. Such threats could include the use of explosives, biological agents or chemical attacks. The solution involves outlining tools, methods and best practices for improved urban planning and assessment based on advanced algorithms that help identify specific urban security vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.\n\nIn more technical terms, the computer-based tool employs automated empirical and semi-quantitative risk analysis (ERA) based on database analysis and expert judgment. It also applies automated quantitative risk analysis (QRA) that examines location, building types, structural elements and load-bearing considerations, factoring in vulnerability analysis as well. The toolset comprises a 3D graphic user interface that offers resilience enhancement measures and their costs, enabling full 3D visualisation of urban planning scenarios, analysis input and results.\n\nAlready, the project team has developed preliminary versions of the ERA module and for quantitative modules covering explosive, biological and chemical threats. It conducted urban case studies across urban environments in Denmark, Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\nMore specifically, three valuable tools are expected to emerge from the project. The first is a concept-level tool supporting risk assessment, a knowledge base and recommendations to further analyse specific risks. The second is a planning-level tool that offers susceptibility analysis of infrastructure, vulnerability analysis of consequences after an event, and identification of hotspots at risk. Last is a detail-level tool that can also be used for susceptibility analysis to cover finer details such as inaccessibility of streets, as well as quantify potential damage to buildings and people. It can also estimate disruption to traffic and identify vulnerable areas or buildings, in addition to helping enhance resilience such as through the replacement or upgrading of specific infrastructure components. More about these tools can be found on the http://www.vitruv-project.eu/ (project website) . Much progress has been achieved on many other fronts, including a draft version of the knowledge base.\n\nOverall, VITRUV stands to enhance urban planning by integrating security and safety considerations, improving policymaking and accountability as well. These tools will help build urban areas that have less crime, social instability and even terrorism.

Only a joint effort by the global community will achieve this.d) Our second sub-goal is to establish a cross-cultural communication between the participants by focusing on our similarities while also not disregarding our cultural differences.We're going to organize this activity as an international youth exchange at a tent camp in the forest \u201cSteigerwald\u201d (near Erfurt) since there have already been partnerships between national youth groups for years. This camp will take place during the Thuringian summer holidays so that the German youth can participate without a problem.The result should be to give the participants a broader worldview instead of only thinking nationally when looking into environmental protection measures. We hope that these steps will give young people an incentive to live a more sustainable life and to make them realize their responsibilities in shaping a pluralistic society. A long term use also lies in the strengthening of our participants identities as well as their personal development while interacting with different young people of various origins (soft skills, intercultural learning).", "http://www.westyorkshiredales.anglican.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE04-KA105-013675_2"], ["2DH", "Raising Aspirations and Improving Skills and Employability", "Wakefield College", 159326.0, "Following on from the success of previous Leonardo and ERASMUS+ projects, the RAISE project has been devised with the key objective of raising the aspirations of our young people and helping them to improve and broaden their skills in order to make Wakefield College students, and in particular those from a disadvantaged background, more employable.

Entrepreneurial skills as solid base for a future in the Creative Industry\u201d project has as central aim to support the (young) (female) entrepreneurs and companies and its employees in the creative sector to go through a transformation and innovation process that is necessary to survive the present times and to become a company with a sustainable business case. The project results will be the relevant profiles of the companies at various stages in this path of development until the year 2026, learning material and digital tools.The core of the company profiles will be the description of core competences and entrepreneurial skills that have to be present in the company at management level and the entrepreneurial skills at the level of the employees.ContextThe Creative Industry has always been part of the communication and information industry. Over the last 30 years the industry has gone through a great deal of technological changes and revolutions. From a manual manufacturing industry dominated by production and output based companies, single channel companies, a change-over to full service communication and information companies, multi-channel companies are now needed. Technology has always been the main (sole) driver for initiating change in the companies. In many cases there is no real research based analyses to support the implementation of the production tools financially. Market research is not a strong point of the entrepreneurs.Goals, results and impact.The aim of this project is to develop innovative ways of learning about entrepreneurship and company development and to promote and create awareness on these subjects in schools and companies in the industry. This awareness is the start to implement the appropriate tools and strategies to drive that road up hill to a sustainable future in this extremely interesting Creative Industry of the future.The company profiles connected to the three direct target groups will be the foundation of the three learning modules that we will focus on. Modern, entrepreneurial skills that will support the individual and company development into a full service provider in the Creative Industry. The modules will have various work formats, from workshops to blended learning assignments with shared responsibilities of the students.An E-tool will be developed for benchmarking and self-assessment. Individuals and companies can apply the e-tool to benchmark their present position on the development scale that has been implemented in the tool, based on the company profiles. By doing this self-assessment, the individuals or companies will get a clear analysis of the gaps they have in entrepreneurial sense to have a successful transformation to the desired situation.Long termThe effect of working in a sustainable manner on the development of a company in the Creative Industry, in particular the communication sector, to get a better connection between the entrepreneur, the company, its customers and their needs. A higher level of customer experience will lead to more employee satisfaction. This all has to be managed by an entrepreneur with the adequate skills.
