WTL\u2019s voice of the customer surveys have identified enormous opportunities for garments which will extend functionality to network connectivity for improved safety in industrial markets. These products represent the outcome of this project. Benefits that arise from this include the ability to sense hazardous chemicals and then indicate danger not only to the garment wearer, but also co-workers and a central control room for large staff deployments. The oil and gas industry provides suitable markets for such garments and discussions with BP have already indicated that they are willing to be early customers.

Each have different diagnoses of the problems, because they do not engage with one another.\u201d The main goal of our project is to try and close this gap, building up cooperation between the two major players of job markets - employers and youth, creating an effective and successful work environment.Companies face several challanges due to changes in labor market trends, such as a trend of labor demand exceeding labor supply in the near future, or the already three different generations (baby boomers, X and Y) present in the labor market augmented with the new generation, so called Gen Z, recently entering the job market with whole new expectations, and so little known about. Our project\u2019s 2 main target groups therefore are companies who already, or will have gen Z employees, and members of gen Z, with the aim of harmonizing the needs of both sides, and bringing effective solutions to help them be more prepared for the new ways of cooperation. Within companies, we have chosen small and medium sized companies (SMEs) as the primary target group, as, according to studies, gen Z prefer to work at SMEs rather than multinational companies, added to which, SMEs represent 99% of all businesses in the EU. We will involve HR managers, company owners, supervisors, team leaders and mentors in our project.We will conduct two exhaustive surveys using the methods of focus group sessions, semi-sructured interviews and questionnaires; one of them involving members of gen Z (16-21yrs) with relevant work experience, who are able to compare their expectations with existing conditions (which makes the research unexampled); and the other researching company demands and experiences with the generation. Our first intellectual output is a methodology providing methods, tools and best practices for SMEs to create an attractive, supporting and retaining working environment, based on the results of the gen Z survey and further research. It aims to help companies gain better understanding of the attitudes, motivators and drives of gen Z, learning how to support and motivate them to work more productively, how to satisfy their needs as employees and how to manage and deal with conflicts. The second intellectual output closely linked with the methodology is the Mentor training, developed based on our surveys of European SMEs\u2019 and gen Z\u2019s demands. A survey of The European Foundation for Management Development and the European Mentoring and Coaching Council reported that, while organizations are experiencing substantial benefits from their investments in this area, in-company mentoring is still a \u201cwork in progress\u201d. Our project addresses this issue by focusing on in-company mentoring, as we believe it to be the bridge between education and work. The mentor training provides valuable knowledge and instructions on how to build a strong, two-leveled in company mentor program. Firstly, the mentor training focuses on developing the key competences mentors need in order to support the integration of new employees from gen Z appropriately. Secondly, the mentors will be trained to train future mentors as well, ensuring the system to be independently and autodynamically working. It will be available in all partner languages, covering all the steps needed to establish a mentor program, assuring the perpetuance of the project.The third intellectual output of the project is a soft skill training material produced for members of gen Z, based on the company survey and further research, prepared in a form adjusted to gen Z\u2019s learning ways. This will help young employees to be more prepared for,  and more confident and content at work, more assertive and able to solve problems due to understanding the demands of the job market and the working styles of older generations.Due to and besides these, we expect the employment rate of gen Z members to increase, the role of SMEs in the labor market and in the local and national industry to grow and the project conception and achievements to reach the decision makers of the educational sector, HR professionals and mentors of the companies, or similar organizations in partner countries. The partners\u2019 extended networks, both embracing the corporate sector (P2, P3, P4) and the field of education (P1, P5, P6, P7), will be connected, raising a bridge over the gap which often divides the fields of education and industry.Ultimately, the main expected result of our project, as detailed above, is a strong, well-established, prosperous relationship, and a foundation of cooperation (with a special focus on working environments) between employers and their (future) employees from Gen Z, based on deep understanding, acceptance, fluent communication, consciousness and grounded knowledge about one another, as well as practical experiences.", "http://www.exponentialtraining.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA202-023939_6"], ["8FU", "TeamMate360", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", 293605.0, "The so-called \u2018digital revolution\u2019 is changing the world in which we live and work. Trends such as home-working and globalisation are contributing to increased use of remote teams. The London Global Leaders\u2019 Summit reported that more than a third of executives expect that over 50% of their full-time employees will work remotely by 2020 (LBS, 2014). Teams are becoming increasingly geographically dispersed: team members might work just a few kilometres from their colleagues, or in different countries and time zones. Whilst remote teams bring benefits for both employers and individuals, they also bring some new challenges. For enterprises such as Google, remote working is embedded in their culture, but for most organisations it is still early days. Although the technology exists to support remote working, management practice is not keeping up with the demands of managing remote teams (CIPD: 2014) and requires a re-think of the role and competences required by both managers and employees (ILM: 2015). TeamMate 360 aims to address this problem.  Using a new on-line 360\u00b0 assessment tool TeamMate 360, partners benchmark the remote team-working practices of 150 managers from the public and private sector, SMEs and larger organisations and social enterprises. To achieve this, a team of trainers will take part in a blended learning course. Trainers will then be equipped with the skills and know-how to pilot TeamMate and to deliver a new VET course designed to provide managers with the skills and behaviours necessary for the management of remote teams.The project will create a new tool, TeamMate, and an innovative VET solution designed to develop the transversal competences managers of remote teams. Through the use of ECVET, participants will also be encouraged to progress toward a full qualification.  The project will culminate with a series of dissemination events designed to demonstrate the impact of the TeamMate. During the events, a series of case studies will be presented illustrating real performance improvement made by participants within their organisation. Once proven, partners plan to make TeamMate available to stakeholders throughout Europe.", "http://www.exponentialtraining.com", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024353_coordinator"], ["8FU", "Inclusion of Digital Education in Adult Learning", "Exponential Training & Assessment Limited", 137480.0, "Digital technologies are quickly changing education and is bringing many opportunities for schools & training organisations, impacting what, where & how education is delivered. However, the adoption of these technologies remain slower than seen in other industries. One study by the European Commission (Survey of Schools: ICT in Education) found that only 25% of students in the European Union are taught by digitally confident and supportive teachers, while another study by the OECD found that 56% of teachers report that they have \u201cmoderate to high development needs\u201d when it comes to using technology at work. In addition, teachers fail to appreciate the digital opportunities which exist and those which are due to open up in the near future.\r\nBuilding the digital skills of teachers & students is a vital step in actually benefiting from technology in education. Various teachers are ready to accept the wave of digitization but more effort still need to be exercised when it comes to teacher training. Outmoded teaching and training methods need to meet with 21st century teaching & learning trends. The IDEAL project aims to help educators, teachers & trainers in (in)formal adult education to understand & put digital education into practice. IDEAL will promote modern pedagogies, training methods & teaching practices, and develop learning materials and tools that support the effective use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in education & training. As a result, the project will promote digital literacy, skills & inclusion for both teachers & learners.\r\n\r\nThe IDEAL project will be executed by a partnership of seven organisation from 6 different EU countries:\r\n- Ense\u00f1a (ES), a training center for employment providing training services to contribute to the development and qualification of both workers & companies.\r\n- Eolas (ES), provides services & support to all enterprises, organisations & entities with demands in the field of the design & management of projects.\r\n- Inqubator Leeuwarden (NL), provides training & coaching to starting companies to firmly establish their business and to help them maximise their personal growth.\r\n- Expontential Training & Assessment (UK), is working with learners in over 50 countries undertaking professional development & qualifications in management & leadership, coaching & mentoring, business support & management consulting.\r\n- CrystalClearSoft (EL), expert in e-learning, develops its own learning tools ranging from e-learning platforms offering personalised learning environments, serious games, simulations, immersive environments etc.\r\n- North-East Regional Development Agency is authorized as provider of training & education by the National Authority for Qualification and carries out this activity under their North-East Regional Studies Center (CRS).\r\n- Eurocrea Merchant (IT) is a consulting & training company that aims to improve the competitiveness of the European society through business development, training & creation of transnational partnership.\r\n\r\nThe project uses a clear, complete & high quality methodology, including the 3 phases:\r\n1.
