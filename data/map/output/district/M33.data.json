Particular attention will be paid to factory ramp-up, which is critical for new products and can be a major stumbling block achieving fast time-to-market. We believe that it is only possible to design a virtual manufacturing process by developing a detailed understanding of the system at all levels. COPERNICO is directed at generic issues spanning the interests of all our industrial partners and indeed common to all factories. The problems include optimizing capacity, removing bottlenecks and scheduling (coordinating with both the upstream and downstream supply chain and minimizing work in progress). The emphasis of COPERNICO is on virtual simulation to eliminate problems before they happen. The preplanning stage is an ideal time in the life-cycle of the plant to include human and environmental concerns, safety factors and work-place satisfaction metrics. The objectives are to: 1. Identify and merge the range of mathematical, physical, data driven and knowledge based models with soft data such as worker and environmental considerations to create a tool to predict the behaviour of production processes and overall factory environments. 2. Use the models to develop optimum processing routes 3. Develop novel experimental methodologies to validate the models in a virtual test bed facility 4.

The COPERNICO virtual factory environment is a free online framework that helps the company select the tools required to move to the next level via the Modelling Tools Recommendation Tool. A company can also follow a customised route map to move forward to the next level and adapt to new challenges in production processes or product areas.\n\nEnd-user partners in the consortium applied the tool to real industrial situations at two SMEs, Footprint Sheffield and Temco, and one large company, Electrolux. Results were quite promising. Temco has now moved production of six parts back to Europe from the Far East with decreased costs and improved efficiency. The specialist toolmaker Footprint Sheffield used the tool to redesign its factory and streamline production, gaining 500 productive hours a year to introduce new products.

Phase 2 will comprise of the mobilities themselves, which we will aim to take as a school group of five, in order to enable the maximum impact on our return to the UK. Phase 3 will involve the dissemination of the mobilities\u2019 impact to our colleagues, pupils, schools in our teaching school alliance and MFL cluster, and to our Spanish link school. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that these mobilities will have a substantial and wide spread impact, both in the short term and long term. In the short term, the linguistic competencies of the delegates will have improved, which will lead to a stronger Spanish presence in the school, improvement of Spanish teaching and learning, and new resources and pedagogical ideas. It will also lead to a more authentic and stimulating learning environment, taking the form of school assemblies, displays, and a central resource bank. Furthermore, these ideas can be disseminated to all the staff in the school through the creation of a simple training package developed from ideas and training from the mobilities. There will also be a ready-made link with the Spanish school, which could be strengthened by making resources and letters from the pupils on the trip itself to exchange with our link school. \r\n\r\nIn terms of longer term impact, the MFL planning and curriculum will be enriched by the mobilities, which will ultimately impact upon hundreds of pupils over the years. The link with the Spanish school, if successfully maintain, will provide a real and meaningful reasons for our pupils to study Spanish, and a link which could be extended beyond primary school and into their secondary experiences. The training package which we could trial in our own school, could be developed and improved, and disseminated to schools in our MFL cluster and in our teaching alliance. We anticipate that participating in this project will raise the profile of Spanish in our school, improve the competencies of our teachers, and raise the enjoyment levels and engagement of our pupils.", "http://www.tyntesfieldschool.co.uk", "Tyntesfield Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035420_coordinator"], ["5FL", "Firs Bilingual Blog", "Firs primary", 5613.0, "The Firs is a Community Primary School catering for 370 children, aged between 3 and 11. \r\n\r\nOur most recent OFSTED inspection rated the school as \u201cGood\u201d.

We now believe that this is not the most effective way to approach language teaching and would like to update our approach, giving more staff the opportunity to become competent in Spanish, French, Italy and German so that they can teach their own classes and integrate language and culture into everyday activities. Languages have become compulsory in primary schools, we believe that our school has a duty to ensure that all our staff have the chance to develop their skills to enhance their future career prospects.\r\n\r\nWe need to offer all our staff the chance to improve their linguistic skills and cultural knowledge in as short a time as possible, and to develop links with schools in France, Spain, Italy and Germany to work together on joint projects and to speak to each other regularly.\r\n\r\nWe have a strong focus on improving provision for our pupils with special educational needs. We see this project as a great opportunity for us to develop improved language learning provision for our SEN pupils which can then be shared with other schools. We need to observe good practice within the Spanish, French, Italian and German education systems, share ideas with colleagues and find good quality resources that will be appropriate for our SEN pupils.\r\n\r\nWe want to find appropriate resources and ideas for 150 children in our Early Years and Foundation Stage, develop our language teaching methodology and increase the use of the target language in the classroom,  develop more cross curricular work, links with literacy and ICT to support language learning, and to improve transition of pupils into secondary school. \r\n\r\nWe aim to send 20 staff on structured training courses in France, Spain, Italy and Germany over the next two years. The courses involve a combination of intensive language learning, cultural information and activities, teaching ideas and methodology, discussion of important issues affecting schools and placement in a French, Spanish, Italian and German primary school.\r\n\r\nWe believe that participation in these courses will give our staff the confidence they need to be able to teach languages in their own classes. Having been immersed in French, Spanish, Italian and German culture and having intensive language classes they will feel able to be spontaneous and creative in the classroom and increase the use of target language. They will have much more confidence in their pronunciation and will be confident to use Spanish, French, Italian or German for classroom instructions and daily routines. They will have a bank of teaching ideas and resources suitable for the age of their classes and will have had the chance to get to know the Spanish, French, Italian and German teachers on a personal level. By giving more members of staff the opportunity to take part in this training, we will give them the skills and confidence they need to be able to perform their current job well and will also improve their future career prospects.\r\n\r\nThey will then be involved in dissemination and follow-up activities to pass on information to the rest of our staff.\r\n\r\nThe courses will give our staff the chance to focus on areas that we particularly want to develop within our school such as effective ways to teach languages in the early years, supporting SEN children, making links with literacy and other curriculum subjects and supporting language learning through ICT and transition. \r\n\r\nThe impact of this project will be significant. There will be a huge change in the way we approach language teaching in our school. All staff will be involved in planning and teaching languages within their own classes. This will lead to a much improved learning experience for our pupils and better attainment. Languages will be embedded into the life and daily routines of the classroom and reinforced through cross curricular links. Pupils will enjoy their lessons more and will greatly increase their understanding of other cultures. They will get to know Spanish, French, Italian and German children through communicating with our link schools and use of eTwinning.\r\n\r\nOur pupils with special educational needs will benefit from the results of this project as staff involved will have a much clearer idea of how to ensure SEN children are able to access language teaching and will have access to suitable materials to engage these pupils. Staff will have had the chance to get to know Spanish, French, Italian and German teachers on a personal level and gain an insight into school life in these countries. They will also have had the chance to observe the practice of teaching staff within another educational system and assimilate good practice into their own teaching. \r\n\r\nThe impact of these courses will be felt by all the staff in our school.
