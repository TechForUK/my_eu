Such ground deformations are usually associated with liquefaction, i.e., a decrease in strength caused by the increase in pore water pressures in saturated cohesionless materials during earthquake ground motion. Much earthquake damage caused by liquefaction-induced excessive displacements can be mitigated by soil improvement methods, thus limiting the associated economic and social problems. Unfortunately, large scale application of the more common soil improvement methods is often avoided because of excessive costs of deep methods and incomplete understanding of potential benefits of other methods. This leads to potentially catastrophic consequences from earthquakes. For this reason preloading is particularly attractive, because, as it is applied from the surface, it can overcome the restriction of prohibitive costs. The goal of this research is to develop a cost-effective method, based on preloading, to reduce seismic liquefaction susceptibility and the associated risk to buildings that may cause many fatalities. Verify and study the method by a field study and develop procedures to estimate improvement and risk mitigation for new sites. Towards this goal the following major tasks will be performed: 1. Study and verify the method by a field preload test 2. Study of the effect of preloading on the cyclic soil strength by elaborate laboratory testing 3. Collect and analyze in-situ test results before and after the field application of preloading 4. Analyze the effect of preloading on the seismic risk of buildings and other structures on liquefaction-susceptible sites by elaborate numerical analyses 5.

FastPass brings together key players of the entire ABC value chain - system and component producers, research institutions, governmental authorities and end-users.\nThe development of a harmonized ABC gate will be accomplished with continuous end-user involvement. The entire innovation process, from components development to the final design of the user interface, will continuously be evaluated by the two end user groups, travellers and border guards.\nBorder control is a major challenge for security and mobility within the EU. Travellers request a minimum delay and a speedy border crossing, while Border Guards must fulfil their obligation to secure the EUs borders against illegal immigration and other threats. Fastpass will serve both demands at the same time to keep security at the highest level while increasing the speed and the comfort for all legitimate travellers at all border control points.\nThe FastPass ABC process will be designed to address both requirements with equal emphasis. One aspect of a speedy border crossing by legitimate travellers is a harmonised user interface. This will allow frequent travellers from Europe and third country states to pass through an ABC with minimum delay, using the full potential of ID documents. Improved traveller identification technologies, such as new biometric modules will increase the security of the ABC process and minimise spoofing.\nA demonstration and evaluation at all types of border (air, land and sea) will be implemented in at least three different member states.

The capabilities have been demonstrated in a number of recent high profile journals detailing optical-neural control from cell culture to primate models. The light-gated cation channels were discovered and first applied by European researchers. The photonics and optoelectronics sectors, which can provide new stimulation technologies to this field, are additionally, European strengths. Nevertheless, in recent years, the dominant research output in this area has shifted to well-funded US laboratories.This proposal therefore aims to create a consortium to develop an array of ultra bright electronically controlled microLEDs which will provide a truly revolutionary tool for the neuroscience and neurotechnology community. The consortium consists of experts in the field who converge the many disciplines (optics, sophisticated LED fabrication, CMOS flip chip design and bonding, biophysics, molecular biology, neurophysiology) to bear on the complex, and crucial to neuroscience, problem of studying dendritic physiology and neural network dynamics. Advances in the techniques of this field will absolutely be required to further our understanding of brain function.
