Three types of external fields will be explored, namely: electromagnetic, ultrasonic and intensive mechanical shearing.\n\nTo meet the future EU challenges of lightweighting and pollution reduction, especially relevant in transportation, it is necessary to improve the castability of light alloys, to enhance grain and eutectic refinement in monolithic alloys, and to develop new high-strength nanocomposites using nano-reinforcers which have only recently become available. Significant mechanical property improvements are foreseen in ExoMet - including 50% increases in tensile strength and ductility, as well as creep resistance up to 300-350 degC (currently limited to about 200 degC in Al and Mg alloys). This applies to both shape castings and wrought products like extruded profiles, bar, cable, sheet and plate.\n\nManufacturing scale-up will be tackled in ExoMet, using a variety of techniques such as low and high-pressure die casting, sand casting, investment casting, differential-presssure casting, twin-roll casting, ultrasound-assisted casting and twin-shear casting. The application of external fields to these industrial techniques is novel and would bring about major savings in energy, scrap and processing cost.\n\nHaving developed the field-enabled processes and produced high-quality light alloys and nanocomposites, the next stage of ExoMet will be prototypying and the assessment of industrial applications in four selected commercial sectors: (i) automotive powertrain and chassis, (ii) aircraft and aero-engine structures, (iii) space satellite and rockets, and (iv) high-strength high-conductivity Al electrical cabling.

Since 2011, the Hansa Berufskolleg has been entitled ' European School ' and firmly established the European guiding principle in the school program and all types of curricula. This becomes especially evident in the close co-operation with the local training companies which mainly act on the international market, i.e. industrial companies in the field of textile and steel trade which increasingly demand training of cross-border qualified employees. Target markets of these companies include the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Poland, Turkey and Italy. Since the year 2000, the Hansa Berufskolleg Unna has organised three-week internships with European funding. In addition, bilingual industrial classes and Europe classes are offered. Voluntary exams in Business English (KMK - tests ) complete the qualification for the European labour market.\r\nBeing abroad means gaining international experiences: The internship serves to acquire intercultural competence, to gain self-confidence and to improve language skills. As part of the final annual ceremony the participants proudly share their individual experiences with the fascinated audience and later receive their EUROPASS to certify their performances.\r\nFrom 26.09. - 17.10.2014, 30 business trainees and 5 students of the business grammar section may again receive experience abroad. \r\n\r\nThe beneficial outcome of the three-week stays have convinced us of adding the new qualification ' Industrial clerk EU ' for the first time, which implements a much longer stay abroad. This year 10 industrial clerks of the bilingual class in their second year of training will have the unique opportunity of doing a training section in Cork, Ireland for 3 months. Based on the positive experience of the pilot phase in 2013 during which 4 industrial clerks had spent two months in Cork under the leadership of the Irish agency Green Horizons, we felt encouraged  to bring this new project on the way. The Chamber of Commerce in Dortmund supports this long-term stay in all areas and welcomes the additional title of ' Industrial clerk EU '. This title enables participants to acquire a significant professional qualification for the global labour market and will be validated in accordance with ECVET-elements. The stay is provided from 29.08.2014 - 21.11.2014 .\r\n\r\nDue to the long-standing European activities further EU projects have been developed:\r\n- For 5 years there has been a Skype-Project with our Dutch partner in Waalwijk. Here, two German and two Dutch students act as founders of a fictitious company. The bilateral development and presentation of these business ideas is done in English. Technical support is offered by the IT department of the district of Unna.\r\n- Currently we are playing an active part in an innovative Comenius Regio project (2012-2014) together with our Polish partner in Nowy Sacz. This projects aims at the development and training of cross-culturally competent employees.\r\n- Due to the numerous stays abroad, a significant increase in the number of participants in the voluntary English tests (KMK - tests) could be detected.\r\n\r\nOverall, the implementation of these EU projects has significantly contributed to improved co-operation between local and foreign companies , the district of Unna and the Hansa vocational college.

To investigate the reasons for the exclusion of the elderly in clinical trials and to provide solutions for this problem. INTRODUCTION. Although the elderly account for high drug consumption, they are underrepresented in clinical trials. With an increasingly ageing European population it is essential to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of drugs. Clinical trials need to take into account the relevant issues of this population, i.e. changed metabolism, multiple chronic conditions and poly-pharmacy. To examine this issue and effect a paradigm shift it is necessary to target gatekeepers and stakeholders of clinical trials. METHODS. The project will be coordinated by the Medical Economics and Research Centre, Sheffield, with guidance from the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Ageing at Keele University, UK. The 5 work packages (WP) will be carried out by a multi-disciplinary team of highly qualified experts in Geriatrics, Gerontology and social sciences. WP1 will involve a systematic review of the literature and review of ongoing clinical trials to assess the extent of exclusion of the elderly. Based on these findings WP2 and WP 3 will investigate why the elderly are underrepresented in clinical trials and what can be done to improve their participation. This will be carried out in 9 countries: UK, Spain, Holland, Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Israel and the Czech Republic. WP2 will research the views of health professionals and ethicists using structured questionnaires. WP3 will explore the perceptions of older patients and carers using a focus group methodology. For WP4, the recommendations from WP2 and WP3 will be used to develop a charter for the elderly in clinical trials. WP5 will disseminate and implement the findings. CONCLUSION. PREDICT will promote the inclusion of the elderly in clinical trials in Europe.
