Now we apply for one more school in order to benefit from our joint experiences and strengths and to help each other.\r\n\r\nWe are three consortium members: The applying Allvar Gullstrand together with Selma Lagerl\u00f6f and Sval\u00f6fs gymnasium.  Selma and Sval\u00f6f keep the contact with the two municipalities Landskrona and Sval\u00f6v for a joint and collected dissemination of our results. Sval\u00f6f also has a long experience from ECVET knowledges.\r\n\r\nObjectives and impacts, organization level: We want to establish a placement network for the upper secondary schools in Landskrona and Sval\u00f6v. This is our main objective. Furthermore as a sidetrack we want to give our teachers an extended international school- and professional perspective that the students may benefit from.\r\n\r\nLandskrona and its vicinity is a region with high youth employment and many of our students are second/third generation immigrants so the project is a possible way to reduce the employment through enhanced European mobility and thereby increase the knowledge about EU/what EU can offer young people in our region. For the municipalities of Landskrona/Sval\u00f6v it is importantant that we keep the education on a high level, fight the segregation between natives and immigrants, offer our students a future without unemployment and counter the student migration from us to the big school cities in south: Lund, Malm\u00f6 and Helsingborg.\r\n\r\nObjectives and impacts, students: It is important for the students to see more of the outside world to create user friendly, ergonomically correct and competitive products and services and moreover to attune their professional skills and experiences to European demands and values. We want to increase their innovation abilities, strengthen their vocational qualifications and their employability in a mobile world where competition no longer has any geographical, cultural and language borders.\r\n\r\nResults and longer term benefits: The students should feel that the whole of Europe is their future labour market and that their products and services should have an international imprint to be able to match different needs in different countries. Instead of practicing for the third time at a local company we give the students the possibility to \u201cExtend their Horizons\u201d. To encounter this students will enhance their language skills. Young people who have been practicing abroad bring back more experience and a broad, international perspective that together with increased quality awareness, level of creativity and entrepreneurship are welcome contributions for future employments in companies in Landskrona and elsewhere, which adds to the Swedish initiative.\r\n\r\nThe placement experiences of the students form the basis for future education and placements at a local level.\r\n\r\nContext/Background, students: All the students come from the third year vocational programs. They have during their first two years been practicing at local companies as a complement to their theoretical studies in their vocational subjects. Abroad they use the skills they have acquired during their upper secondary school years and learn new curricular skills. \r\n\r\nMethodology: We intend to use ECVET, which means a written Memorandum of Understanding and a Learning Agreement. Through ECVET we hope even better to be able to document and identify what results each student should achieve abroad, how to assess, validate and quality ensure and in what way the new skills can be incorporated in their individual education plan. \r\n\r\nProfile, activities, impact, staff: Concerning the staff who are to participate in the staff training we intend the teachers who are directly involved in the students who are sent abroad, but not strictly vocational teachers but also others as language teachers, social sciences teachers etc. as they all partake in the teaching of our vocational students. \r\n\r\nActivities and number of participants: We apply for 81 students and 7 assistants on placements abroad and 10 teachers for staff training. The students are selected; they write their CVs, are prepared linguistically and intercultural, enter agreements and contracts concerning future placement.\r\n\r\nAbroad the students take part in practical modules with an educated monitor at their hand, as a part of their theoretical and practical education. The monitor will be present during all the three weeks. \r\n\r\nAfter the placement period the students get written assessments, the result is validated, and is credited in the students\u00b4 education plan. Europasses are issued as an evidence of the placement periods abroad.\r\n\r\nThe teachers on staff training discuss with their colleagues abroad during during two working days school issues, exchange experiences and solve common problems.

Our aim is to develop and improve our education to give our students higher competence and qualifications and to meet the changing demands and requirements of the labour market.

In the curriculum for the Swedish natural resource program a global perspective of natural resources is emphasized. Also, our students constitute a rather homogenous group with few students with an immigration background. This makes internationalization even more important.\r\n\r\nAll our students do 15 weeks of internship which is an essential part of their vocational training. We want to have a structured program for European internships in order to raise the appeal for and the international dimension of our education.\r\n\r\nThe teachers participating in this project all have long experience of organizing internships. In order to establish good contacts with the companies involved we want some of our teachers to job shadow there to learn how the work place is and discuss the structure of the internships.\r\n\r\nWe will co-operate with Across Europe Education Consulting Ltd in Great Britain which has worked for a long time with international mobility for students and teachers through Leonardo da Vinci- and Erasmus projects. They have a big network of companies for internships within the horse industry, animal care and farming.\r\n\r\nAs we are a school for natural resources, we work a lot with sustainable development. Sustainable development consists of different aspects such as environment, human rights, social and economic  development, democracy, equality etc. All those aspects you can achieve a better insight into in an international context. They are also important for the students' future professionally, socially and personally. In the curriculum for the natural resource program it is emphasized that the students should be given a global perspective of natural resources. Further, it is stated that the students should be given the possibility to develop innovative thinking and entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Erasmus+ Mobility meets the following needs in our organization.\r\n- A widened understanding of the world.\r\n- Improved understanding of sustainable development.\r\n- A global perspective of agribusiness.\r\n- Increased input of innovative thinking and entrepreneurship.\r\n- Improved occupational skills and increased employability.\r\n- Improved language ability.\r\n\r\nInternationalization also increases the staff's possibilities to clarify these aspects for the students.

After building in the results of two earlier Erasmus+ projects, there are still plenty of areas of education to be improved, professional challenges to face, which is impossible without a dedicated, well-prepared and motivated teaching staff. As the number of foreign students enrolling at our school is increasing, it is vital to get to know the latest and the most state of the art European methods and good practices, to integrate them into our every day work so that all the cultural, educational and language gaps could be bridged. The permanent language improvement of colleagues teaching non-bilingual classes to acquire confidence in their language use is essential to both support their students\u2019 education and communicate with parents efficiently. There is also a growing demand on higher level German language studies at our school, therefore, one of our German language teachers will also take part in a teacher development course in Germany.\r\nJob shadowing in support of theoretical professional development courses has become an important part of our project this year.  It is essential to study the diverse educational systems of Europe in depth and get an insight into their good practices to gain invaluable first-hand experience after theoretical establishment, in a helpful English speaking environment. \r\nOur Polish project partner is a primary school in Warsaw, excelling at teaching English at a high level and actively collaborating with our primary teachers in an eTwinning project this year. Our colleagues will get an insight into the education of children with learning and behavioural difficulties as well as into the methodology of teaching English from an early age. The knowledge gained during this visit can be fully applied in their everyday work in the classroom and can satisfy the parents\u2019 professional demands and priorities as well.\r\nIn the previous academic year our secondary school students carried out a successful online project with the pupils of our partner school in Folkestone, England. One of the aims of the job shadowing activity there is to get acquainted with high level (A-level) education of natural sciences in Britain. The experiences gained can be used to improve the project orientated learning, deal with talented students and facilitate the innovative use of modern IT tools and methods. \r\nFocusing on individual needs of gifted students is one of the strengths of the partner school. The applied methods and good practices can be used to facilitate both our language teaching and the preparation of our students for higher education. One of our colleagues teaching English language and British Civilization gets motivating, inspiring and cooperative teaching ideas from them.\r\nThe improvement of digital competences can be regarded as one of the major challenges of our changing world that all of us need to face, especially those who participate or plan to participate in eTwinning projects. Some colleagues will take part in professional development courses which will promote a better understanding of these areas.\r\nThe decreased motivation of students and their higher threshold of response are other challenges of the digital world. For modern bilingual and science education, it is vital to renew the motivational tools of our secondary school colleagues by their participation in European teacher development courses.   \r\nThroughout our 2017 Erasmus+ project 11 colleagues take part in different mobilities. The job shadowing activities have 4 participants, 2 teachers in Poland and 2 in the UK. The four primary and seven secondary teachers involved represent the whole school, covering the most important areas of the profile of our institution.  As a result of the courses and job shadowing activities, the repertoire of the school\u2019s good practices will be enriched. The experiences and fresh inspiration obtained will be shared with students and parents during everyday work and colleagues and the wider pedagogical environment on dissemination events.\r\nBoth the preparation and implementation phase of the project and our multiplicator role during dissemination have positive impacts on collegiality and the revival of our school life.

The continuous professional development and the intrinsic force to be innovative and open to reforms changed the teachers as well as the students of Budapest 2nd District Szab\u00f3 L\u0151rinc Bilingual Primary and Secondary School for ever. This year\u2019s project is titled \"New Dimensions in Bilingual Education\" in the framework of which 16 colleagues take part in various mobility programmes. The project summarizes the most important outcomes of the mobility activities and their possible effects. It includes taking part in courses and job shadowing. Courses benefit all levels of the school from lower and upper primary to secondary, both the bilingual and the language preparation classes through the acquisition of intercultural and ICT competencies, new methods and teaching/thinking strategies. The job shadowing activities are all connected to the previous projects and our eTwinning network. Job shadowing has contributed to the school\u2019s internationalisation to a great extent.  \r\n\r\nThe mobilities in harmony with the strategic development plan of the school contribute to \r\n- the development of a high command of English and German indispensable to the effective multifaceted communication inside and outside school\r\n- the extension of the number of bilingual subjects\r\n- the classroom material design for bilingual subjects\r\n- the training of professional personnel for bilingual education\r\n- the methodological and professional revival of the teaching staff\r\n- the promotion of using ICT and project-based strategies in all classes\r\n- the continuous professional self-training of the teaching staff\r\n- the motivation of students\r\n- the cooperation and teambuilding of the partakers\r\n- helping in the integration of non-Hungarian students\r\n- the successful integration of students with special needs\r\n- the enforcement of the European Dimensions in the school\r\n- helping with keeping the school in the European educational mainstream\r\n\r\nThis project is the continuation of the development that was started earlier. The school successfully complies with the regulations of bilingual education and effectively prepares students for the advanced level Matura exams. One of the school\u2019s new head teacher\u2019s major goals is to implement the cutting-edge methodology of the Western European educational system into our teaching process. The targeted mobility activities offer great possibilities to gain insight to the freshest knowledge / know-how available. The front-line methodology and ICT technologies motivate students and revitalize the lessons. Thanks to our expanding international network the students can practise the English and German languages with more efficiency. The project also helps us prepare for the realisation of the Digital Educational Strategy. Beside the teaching competencies, some transversal competencies are developed as well, such as learning abilities, communication, problem solving and the leadership and management skills, not to mention creativity and the ability to take part in teamwork.\r\n\r\nWhen planning this project, we were very specific to pay attention to all the details and needs of the whole school and its sections. We have been preparing very carefully so as to be able to collect the most diverse and variable experiences during the mobility activities. During the planning of the application, different liabilities were assigned, all partakers contributed to the compilation of the project design. The whole team keeps in touch and cooperates during the project and represents the school and the country to the best of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nA great emphasis has been put on the dissemination of the knowledge gained during the mobility activities. All partakers have the possibility to disseminate the practices they have acquired on various platforms. We have already established a new educational tradition in our district, which is titled the Professional Day in Pasar\u00e9t. This is a dissemination event where colleagues can share their experience gained during their mobility.\r\n\r\nThe most visible and immediate effect of the Erasmus+ mobility applications was that the colleagues taking part in the programme started to think together as a cohesive team for the good of the school and its students. The various mobility activities in the long run contribute to the school\u2019s innovation and open new professional dimensions.\r\n\r\nAll applying colleagues find that the programme engulfs in significant linguistic development, intercultural experience and professional revival, and all these help to impede the process of burning out. In a broader context, this mobility programme means a high quality jump towards the future, a development in the abilities necessary to meet international educational expectations and to get in the mainstream system of European schools.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever world offers you, curiosity will make you see it the way you want it.\" (L\u0151rinc Szab\u00f3: Curiosity)", "http://www.earlscliffe.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA101-047352_5"], ["2HR", "Demain, au-del\u00e0 du Viaduc", "Castlewoods Hotel Ltd", 22750.0, "Jean Vigo High School and Vocational High School have made the international opening a strong axis of their school project and they have realized professional mobilities abroad for many years.\r\n\r\nOur students come from a rural area and they have a low propensity for occupational mobility.

The objectives of the project are to develop challenging and interesting teaching materials and activities that can be used in projects, during project days and during  student exchanges. The activities are aimed at developing the skills and competences that students need  for study and work in an international setting. There are at least 70 active participants in the project ( coordinator, teacher-designers and students of five countries)  who are committed to making the best   teaching materials and activities as active members of an Erasmus group.   The teacher-designers are supported by other teachers in their school.  There are development meetings during which the teacher-designers develop the teaching materials and activities and short term student exchanges during which the materials and activities are tried and tested in real-life situations with students from different countries. The methodology used is make - test - adapt. The teacher-designers develop the materials and activities. The students give the teachers feedback after the testing of the materials and activities. The teachers then adapt the materials and activities. The result of the project will be a booklet with all the teaching materials and activities which will be made available to schools and organisations. The impact of the project  on the students is that , besides developing important skills and compteneces, they will also gain experience in working together with foreign students, learn about UNESCO themes and gain experience in working together with adults sharing responsibility for the end product.  They will also become more entrepreneurial and social. The impact on the schools inside and outside the project is that they will spend more time on projects  with a UNESCO theme because they have ready-made tested materials and activities.
