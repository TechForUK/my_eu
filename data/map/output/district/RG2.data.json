To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).

However, for ice charting, tactical navigation and management of off-shore activities much more important is to know and avoid hazardous sea ice conditions. In general, sea ice hazards are related to sea ice thickness. More often than not polar ships and off-shore platforms are only operating during summer seasons and certain regions. This is because they are designed to resist typical forces of induced by pack ice, but they are not designed to resist the extreme sea ice conditions. \n\nOngoing climate warming has manifested as shrinking and thinning of pack ice in the Arctic. This is a primary driver for the increasing shipping, oil and gas explorations and mining activities in the Arctic. However, severe sea ice conditions still exist and in consequence many locations are impossible for ship based operations. Moreover, year-to-year variability of sea ice is very large and hazardous multiyear ice (MYI) floes sometimes appear also in typically seasonally ice free regions.\n\nIn order to response needs of increase polar activities, we propose to focus on detection of sea ice extremes and automatic production of \u201csea ice warnings\u201d products. In particular, we aim for a detection of MYI floes in a area composed mostly first-year ice from synthetic aperture radar (SAR), heavily ridged ice regions from SAR, the thickest ice from radar altimeter (RA) thickness profiles, regional anomalies of thick or thin ice via passive microwave (PMW) data, sea ice areas vulnerable for the wave action, detection of early/late melting season and improving capabilities to forecast seasonal sea ice extremes.", 210825.0, 2464640.0, "SPICES", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ecmwf.int", null, "h2020_193692_999916741"], ["9AX", "Gap Analysis for Integrated Atmospheric ECV CLImate Monitoring", "European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts", "There is a recognised need for establishing sound methods for the characterisation of satellite-based Earth Observation (EO) data by surface-based and sub-orbital measurement platforms - spanning Atmosphere, Ocean and Land observations and the entire radiance spectrum.

In 2008, JMA (via the JMA Basketball Academy) became one of the first institutions in the UK to deliver the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) framework on behalf of Basketball England. AASE is a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport by competing on the world stage or securing a professional contract. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at the JMA Basketball Academy. Working with Baloncesto M\u00e1laga, S.A.D. (Unicaja) in Spain, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Basketball Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the JMA Basketball Academy programme and students.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding lifelong learning principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the 20 (male and female) Apprentices undertaking JMA Basketball Academy programme in the 2017/18 academic year (ie the 2016 and 2017 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their basketball ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will take place at Unicaja, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Spanish youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nUnicaja has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable JMA to enhance the activities of participants. For example:\r\n- Access to high quality local and regional basketball clubs with activities to include training sessions and games at world class training facilities.\r\n- A visit to the Basketball Federation of Andalusia to undertake work shadowing, observe the professional practices and explore exit pathways.\r\n- Observation of live Liga ABC Basketball games. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nJMA will put in place a detailed project work plan to set timescales and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n1) MANAGEMENT PROCESSES (JUL-AUG 2017):\r\n- Logistics Contract: outlining who is responsible for each of the practical and logistical aspects of the placement.\r\n- Memorandum of Association: to agree ECVET learning outcomes.\r\n- Communications Plan: Management processes agreed and finalised.\r\n- Dissemination Plan: identification of the key information to be distributed, to who on what timescales.\r\n\r\n2) PREPARATION ACTIVITIES (SEP 2017):\r\n- Information & Guidance: provision of clear and accessible resources. \r\n- Individual Learning Plans: clearly defining the project objectives and responsibilities in achieving them.\r\n- Participant Assessment: assessment of individual goals and learning outcomes.\r\n- Preparation Sessions: tailored to the individual needs of participants.\r\n\r\n3) PROJECT DELIVERY (OCT 2017):\r\nDelivery of planned project activities.\r\n\r\n4) EVALUATION ACTIVITIES (NOV 2017):\r\n- Recognition: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n- Evaluation: comprehensive evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Evidence of progress against recognised vocational qualifications. \r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on JMA are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the Basketball Academy programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the Basketball Academy programme and also the wider Sports Academy.", "http://www.johnmadejskiacademy.co.uk", "John Madejski Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036153_coordinator"], ["7AU", "Youth workers Pedal for Peace", "Follow The Women", 35140.0, "The project gathers together female youth workers promoting peace in different parts of Europe and its neighbouring countries to share their experiences, best practices, motivate each other and to get to know each other and new partner organisations for future projects while biking around \u00c5land islands.

The unequal share of powers affects the way men and women act and cooperate in trainings and in other events.
