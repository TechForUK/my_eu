It has been named 'City Lights' in view of the fact that both partner country participants are referred to as living in the City. Furthermore, the Sunderland stadium is called the Stadium of Lights. The Valletta Local Council and Riverside Consulting CIC in the United Kingdom will be working together to create a project for their youths revolving around the topic of sports, culture and climate. It is the norm that certain countries excel in certain sports on account of the fact that the climate conditions are on their side. This project will therefore aim to shine light on the different cultures of the two partner countries. In turn we will not only be encouraging youths to be active and healthy but we will also be discussing culture in relation to climate.\r\n\r\nThis project will take place in two parts, the first being an exchange held here in Malta and the second being an exchange held in the UK.

In view of this, we will be learning about the different ways in which the climate of a country can affect the natural talent of the citizens of that country. Throughout the exchanges we will be organizing several outings and activities that will allow the young participants to be active and sportive whilst also being given the opportunity to experience the culture of the hosting country. \r\n\r\nThe project will end with a video documenting the entire project from start to finish and showing all conclusions that the young participants come to throughout the project.", "http://riversideconsulting.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-MT01-KA105-003578_1"], ["6DD", "HTL-Rankweil.JobsAbroad.15", "Liebherr Sunderland Works Ltd.", 10677.0, "During their time at HTL Rankweil, our students receive their education and training both in theory and practice.

Our vocational college educates students in the fields of electronics, IT, structural and civil engineering, timber construction and integrated building technologies. The Erasmus exchange allows students to complete an internship with an international company, in a foreign country. This takes place, as part of their vocational education, at some point between July 2018 and June 2019. The name of the project is \u201cHTL Rankweil 2018 Internship Abroad and Internationalisation\u201d. \r\n\r\nOur school is known outside of Austria and is situated in Vorarlberg, which lies in the heart of a prosperous and highly technical area of the Rhein valley (\u201cRheintal\u201d), where there are many international companies. Our graduates are sought after as skilled workers by these firms and as such, it is important that our students receive a high standard of education which not only provides a contemporary approach, but also considers elements which will be important in the years to come. Through our school\u2019s cooperation with with international companies, our students can complete a professional internship, as well as gaining professional experience in a foreign country. The project allows students to gain new knowledge and skills in their field, as well as giving them an important insight into the professional world. \r\n\r\nSix students from the Electronics and IT pathway have the opportunity to undertake their internship in the UK with international companies like Zumtobel Group, Liebherr and Neutrik AG. These internships last 4-6 weeks. From the construction pathway, four students can gather professional experiences with the construction company S+B Group in Prague or Warsaw. The aim of the project is to allow students to learn new, discipline-specific skills from a company in a foreign country and further develop what they have already learnt at school. In addition to this, it is a chance to improve their foreign language skills, as they are required to use English in the workplace. Furthermore, they receive international experience and develop valuable connections for later in their careers. The project strengthens cooperation with foreign companies and is an important stimulus for the school\u2019s international outlook. The school\u2019s network is further developed by the project because the students also get to know other firms and institutes whilst in their host countries. Through their residency, the students also get new socio-cultural awareness of another country and experience more of the European Union. This exchange also imparts social competences onto the students through working in a team and promotes independence, far away from home. The students develop greatly in terms of character. The experience of an internship abroad can then be put to use back in school, with the students applying their new skills to their lessons.", "http://www.liebherr.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039111_3"], ["0LS", "European Schools Cooperating: Healthy Organisations Learning, Achieving, Reviewing", "South Hylton Primary School", 172200.0, "The E-SCHOLAR project (European Schools Cooperating: Healthy Organisations Learning, Achieving Reviewing) is a three-year project being delivered in the context of Sunderland and Saint-Nazaire\u2019s longstanding partnership.
