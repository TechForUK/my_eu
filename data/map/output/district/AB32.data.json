Aberdeenshire are embracing this and aim to introduce a modern language to children from primary one to primary seven, and a second from primary five onwards.  In order to address and embed European and International awareness through languages, teachers are required to have relatively high confidence levels.  Aberdeenshire Council are in the beginning stages of up-skilling their teachers. Autumn, a primary teacher from Aberdeenshire, wishes to engage in a one week LFEE immersion course in Malaga, to gain confidence and skills in teaching Spanish and enhance her knowledge and understanding of Spanish culture, in addition to inspiring, informing and supporting her colleagues at school and cluster schools.Autumn is enthusiastic at the prospect of meeting teachers from other European countries and sees this as a fantastic opportunity to build long-term, sustainable relationships with European schools.  Autumn is very aware of the numerous benefits of finding partner schools in both the UK and abroad; allowing staff and pupils to communicate and collaborative, as well as, improving ICT skills.  Furthermore, she believes this could be crucial in the implantation of the 1 + 2 Language programme and a key motivational tool for pupils, thus, enhancing and improving learning.Autumn intends to be involved in a range of dissemination activities surrounding her experience.  She aims to guide and motivate her colleagues, both teaching and non-teaching, with new ideas, materials and resources.  Autumn will then share this with her local cluster schools, as well as, with parents.  In addition to creating an information leaflet about her experience and the benefits of embracing the Scottish Government's 1 + 2 Languages programme, she plans to offer twilight sessions and in-service days.As a result of the LFEE immersion course, it is expected that Autumn's confidence and abilities in the teaching of modern languages will have increased significantly and will help to raise the profile and awareness of languages across her cluster in Aberdeenshire.  Consequently, helping to integrate and embed languages into daily classroom routines, in line with the 1 + 2 Languages programme.  Schools across Aberdeenshire will benefit from promoting languages and global citizenship, thus helping better equip pupils for an ever growing multilingual society.", "http://www.crombie.aberdeenshire.sch.uk/", "Crombie School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023753_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB32"}
