Hindering attempts to prevent autoimmune T1D, the aetiology and pathogenesis of the islet auto-immunization, including whether it is preceded by metabolic abnormalities and cell-mediated autoimmunity, is still poorly understood. To overcome this, DIAPREPP will focus on the early auto-immunization against islet antigens, in particular to disclose events preceding current autoantibody markers. The concept is that events prior to auto-immunization govern the likelihood and \u2018signature\u2019 of immunization, which in turn determines progression to disease. The overall objective is to determine mechanisms of islet autoantigen immunization.

The expected impact of DIAPREPP is new fundamental knowledge regarding how 1. immunization against islet autoantigens can occur; 2. signs of self-immunization can be exploited for prediction and monitoring of disease; and 3. the immunization or its progression to islet beta cell destruction and T1D development can be prevented.", 150802.0, 6697517.0, "DIAPREPP", "Finding ways to prevent childhood diabetes", "Understanding the causes of type1 diabetes (T1D) and finding early disease markers seem the only way forward to reduce disease incidence.

Considering the associated morbidity and substantially decreased life quality of T1D patients, novel strategies for preventing T1D are urgently required.\n\nThe key objective of the EU-funded 'Diabetes type 1 prediction, early pathogenesis and prevention' (DIAPREPP) project was to understand the mechanisms of autoimmunisation against self-antigens in order to develop diagnostic tools and strategies for preventing clinical T1D. Information about the project and related links can be found http://www.diaprepp.eu/ (online).\n\nCurrently, the earliest identifiable process in the pathogenesis of T1D is the development of autoantibodies to islet beta cells. However, the causes and events that precede the emergence of autoantibodies remain poorly understood.\n\nAfter generating a unique source of clinical material from children followed from birth to autoimmunity through to disease development, the consortium performed a thorough analysis of the patient metabolome. Interestingly, an altered profile in terms of phospholipid content and other metabolites in cord blood was found to be specifically associated with islet autoimmunity that leads to T1D.\n\nIn order to investigate the potential viral aetiology of T1D, partners examined patient samples for the presence of enteroviruses in relation to the appearance of islet autoantibodies, dietary intervention, maternal type 1 diabetes and clinical symptoms. Human enterovirus (HEV) was detected in nearly 10\u00a0% of the samples, but no correlation was found between the presence of HEV in the first year of life and the development of islet autoantibodies.\n\nHowever, the presence of enterovirus in the pancreatic islets of T1D patients led scientists to further investigate the mechanism of virus infection. They discovered that enterovirus could enter, infect and destroy beta cells while at the same time activating innate immune response pathways.\n\nAdditionally, genetic susceptibility was found to be instrumental in progression to T1D development. Children positive for islet autoantibodies were twice as prone to develop the disease if they carried susceptible genotypes for various genes, including IFIH1.\n\nAn important line of work of the DIAPREPP study entailed the development of technology for the capture and study of single immune responsive cells. This technology was implemented to identify autoantibodies that could be subsequently used for diagnostic purposes.\n\nThis commercially exploitable diagnostic technology, combined with the scientific discoveries of the DIAPREPP study, will contribute to the design of preventive measures against childhood diabetes.", "http://www.diaprepp.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2012-12/56054.jpg", "fp7_86772_999555707"], ["8XH", "Improved Water efficiency through ICT technologies for integrated supply-Demand side manaGEmenT", "Sms Energy Services Limited", "The aim of iWIDGET is to advance knowledge and understanding about smart metering technologies in order to develop novel, robust, practical and cost-effective methodologies and tools to manage urban water demand in households across Europe, by reducing wastage, improving utility understanding of end-user demand and reducing customer water and energy costs.The main scientific challenges for iWIDGET are the management and extraction of useful information from vast amounts of high-resolution consumption data, the development of customised intervention and awareness campaigns to influence behavioural change, and the integration of iWIDGET concepts into a set of decision-support tools for water utilities and consumers, applicable in differing local conditions.In order to meet these aims and challenges, iWIDGET will investigate: (i) how best to provide the dynamic accurate measurement and data transfer of useful information about end-user water consumption, (ii) how best to use consumption data to improve the operation of utilities and influence end-users to modify their behaviour, (iii) how to arrive at the best business model to convert a promising technology into a useful and cost-effective product, and (iv) how to demonstrate and validate the new methodologies on two case studies in the North and South of Europe.", 276751.0, 4024767.0, "iWIDGET", null, null, null, null, "http://www.up-ltd.co.uk", null, "fp7_105822_974978429"], ["8XH", "SmArt BI-directional multi eNergy gAteway", "Sms Energy Services Limited", "Flexibility needs to be added to Europe\u2019s power system to accommodate an increasing share of variable power generation from renewable sources.

These are students from different sectors. Students of the departments of Technique, Health and Social Care, ICT, Retail and Whole Sale, Marketing, Sports, Tourism and Horeca regularly go abroad. Most of them are full time students of level 4. To a specific number of courses, e.g. Tourism and Export Assistant, international internships are common parts of the curriculum.\r\nNumber of teachers and their profile:\r\nThe consortium expects that approximately 200 teachers go abroad for a study visit. These visits have the aims of upgrading of ones professionalism, to offer training courses or to visit schools and companies to gain more knowledge about innovative developments within their field(s) of profession.

For the upcoming years, we are going to focus on involving consortium employees, since the role of teacher/coach is significant in the student\u2019s decision to go abroad, which is established in a recent study done by consortium, please find attached. It therefore seems that the ambition to expand internationalisation is related to employees who have experience with going abroad, since they act as ambassadors in favour of internationalisation and thus enthuse students and colleagues alike to participate in an international activity. \r\nOur HR policy is always aimed at professionalising employees and internationalisation is one of the tools that we use to enhance this, for instance by offering a language course or a specialised training to our employees. Not only does a foreign experience add to the employees\u2019 knowledge but it also adds to personal educational ideas and educational development put within a wider European perspective. Naturally the foreign experience should be used as an asset to develop either the educational team or an educational element. \r\nAnother goal for the upcoming year is to focus on incorporating internationalisation within the HR policy. We are going to implement internationalisation in both PDP conversations and year evaluations and it will be noted in our team plans. Employees are expected to clearly account for their learning goals in the document \u2018Work programme VETPRO\u2019 before leaving, since by doing so the foreign experience is secured within the educational team and/or element. Moreover, the manager is going to sign the document \u2018Work programme VETPRO\u2019 beforehand. The document will then become a part of the digital tool and will be added to the employee\u2019s file. \r\nAs is mentioned above the teacher/coach plays a significant role in the students\u2019 decision process, and therefore the steering committee is going to inform teachers/coaches better in the upcoming Call about the possibilities within internationalisation. The first time that consortium organised a meeting was in 2016 and involved every member of the internationalisation working groups from three ROCs, hence these meetings are going to take place in the upcoming years as well. The head committee is going to provide better information to teachers/coaches by help of the working group members; in which they are aided by an informational leaflet and the website of consortium that is in development. In addition to this the head committee wants to offer courses, such as the IOA course or NUFFIC courses to employees who fulfil an active role within internationalisation.\r\nIn short 'staff awareness for internationalisation' means:\r\n- the results of a foreign experience will be secured by the 'work programme VETPRO', endorsed by the manager.\r\n- improved information for teachers/coaches.\r\n- offering sources regarding internationalisation.\r\nThe Erasmus+ 2016 System Check proved that the consortium used all kinds of documents to account for the grant. The steering committee decided to develop a digital tool in which everyone uploads and files the same documents. Spring 2017 there will be a pilot using the tool and it will be deployed simultaneously starting from the school year 2017/2018.\r\nIn the context of quality improvement we would like to come to more in-depth agreements with our preferred partners. In 2017 the consortium is going to organise a meeting with our preferred partners in order to agree on the following: student exchange based on ECVET, job shadowing, incoming and outgoing mobility and management exchange.\r\nOur level 1 and 2 students have often never been abroad, but increasingly participate\r\nin foreign experiences.
