Bladder cancer incidence is strongly related to age, with the highest incidence rates being in older men and women. Cystoscopy/cystoscopic biopsy remains the current gold standard diagnostic and monitoring tool. This procedure is highly invasive and expensive - costing up to \u20ac1200 per test - and has been reported to miss in the region of 25% of all bladder tumours.  As an adjunct to cystoscopy, urine cytology is routinely carried out globally but its deficiencies in terms of poor cancer detection (low sensitivity) are well recognised and reported.  \n\nThe overall objective of the LAUREN project is to provide a commercial non-invasive in vitro diagnostic that will significantly reduce the management cost of caring for bladder cancer patients, whilst at the same time improving patient comfort and reducing morbidity associated with current invasive procedures.  The specific diagnostic is based on the MCM2 \\ Immunofluorescence biomarker for bladder cancer cells found in urine.The scope of the project is to complete the final development, validation and regulatory activities required to prepare a novel the new diagnostic for the market.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to:\nPO1  Clinically validate the biomarkers including the addition of Immuno Fluorescence \nPO2  Complete development of and validate a single use cell collection device,\nPO3  Validate the cell recognition software for regulatory acceptance\nPO4  Validate the software of an automated slide analysis system.\nPO5  Prepare a complete evidence package to support obtaining a CE Mark and FDA approval for commercialisation", 2589510.0, 2589510.0, "LAUREN", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197552_934942552"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9DG", "Bucksburn Academy Modern Languages 1+2", "Bucksburn Academy", 7132.0, "The participants had the desire to upgrade their languages skills and discovered the Erasmus+ programme through network meetings.

Pupils will be exposed to communication with other schools abroad through the use of ICT. \r\n\r\nThe programme would not only help the pupils and the teachers, but would also have an impact on the wider school community. Other staff members will be made aware of this programme which is a great professional development opportunity across the European Union. Besides, it is required that pupils access at least two foreign languages by 2020, which is not currently possible at Bucksburn Academy. Erasmus+ will allow our language teachers to receive further training and therefore they will be able to offer courses in these languages at the level required by SQA (Scottish Qualification Authority).", "http://www.bucksburnacademy.org.uk", "Bucksburn Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046843_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB21"}
