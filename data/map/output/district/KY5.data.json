They are the MFR of L\u2019Arbresle, Saint Laurent de Chamousset and Chessy in the Rh\u00f4ne d\u00e9partement, Saint Etienne and Montbrison in Loire, Montluel in Ain, Bonne, Th\u00f4nes and Seyssel in Haute-Savoie. Since the first Leonardo Da Vinci project in 2004, the promoter has chosen a group application in order to harmonize the management and monitoring, to guarantee quality and results of each participant \u2018s mobility.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of our application are the reinforcement of professionnal skills, the discovery of other cultures and the ability to embrace other cultures as well as an outward looking attitude.\r\n\r\nThen operational objectives aim at strengthening expertise and inter-personal skills in the following fields:\r\n\r\n- Significant improvement in the languages approach and in their learning.\r\n\r\n- The reinforcement of integration and adaptation skills by immersing partcipant in workplacement company and by taking part to its activities.\r\n\r\n- Acquisition of professionnal skills specific to business, to vocational curriculum, through activities determined beforehand by the partners.\r\n\r\n- Discovery of a European Union country and of its culture.\r\n\r\n- Development of autonomy and adaptability in order to take responsibility for themselves and gain selfconfidence.\r\n\r\n- As to the ability to embrace other cultures and  tolerance, the MFR of Chessy gives a very interesting objective:\u201d The young have a lot of a priori, especially concerning Eastern countries because they consider they are poor and dangerous. Taking them to meet these populations and immersing them in a different but close to ours way of life is a prior objective for us concerning life learning and openmindedness.\u201d This exemple shows the necessity to provoke a deep change in our students\u2019 representations whatever the hosting country is.\r\n\r\nIn this project, our ambition is that 219 students can leave. They are all studying for a level 4 vocational qualification in many different fields such as trade, social and health care, landscape gardening\u2026 Most of them are from rural areas and aim to work and live in rural areas. They have no or very little previous experience of mobility abroad and we believe they will draw benefits from this stay for themselves and for their future employability.\r\n\r\nAs to the project management, activities are shared between the promoter and the MFR involved.\r\n\r\nThe promoter carries out promotion, administrative and financial management, technical support, quality control of the project and its dissemination thanks to 3 project leaders.\r\n\r\nEach MFR with its own project leader is in charge of the preparation, information, organization of the stay, of monitoring and supporting students abroad, of exploiting their work afterwards, validating their skills and disseminating the results. The steering committee is composed of the project leaders, the regional federation director, the directors of each MFR. The technical committee is composed of the project managers and of each project leaders. They organize, plan and supervise every stage of the program by organizing many meetings or phone conferences.\r\n\r\nThe results and impact can take a variety of forms on a short or longer term. First, we expect the widening of professional skills of the beneficiaries. This experience will allow them to discover and put into practice different working methods, to improve their language comprehension, especially oral comprehension, to become aware of the necessity of speaking another language in order to be able to exchange and communicate. It will also allow them to develop personally since they will gain maturity and autonomy and thus gain self-confidence.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, we aim at making them aware of European issues, and making them aware of the notion of European citizenship, which is still a vague and abstract notion for our students.  We also aim at awakening the desire of travelling and of embracing other cultures. This notion is fundamental for our students since withdrawal temptations often emerge from these rural areas where most of them come from. We cannot consider the benefits for the moment but we will assess the effects in the continuation of European construction.", "http://www.levertraining.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000195_7"], ["9AF", "Un stage europ\u00e9en pour d\u00e9velopper ses comp\u00e9tences et pr\u00e9parer son insertion professionnelle", "Lever Training Limited", 416827.0, "Through this grouped application Erasmus + of the teaching and vocational training, the MFR Rh\u00f4ne- Alpes regional federation gathers twelve schools.  They are  the MFR of Seyssel, Bonne, Th\u00f4nes  (CFMM ), Cruseilles les Droni\u00e8res, Sallanches in the Haute-Savoie region, Eyzin-Pinet and Chatte in the Isere region; Chessy- les mines, L\u2019Arbresle, Saint Laurent de Chamousset in the Rh\u00f4ne region, Montbrison in the Loire region and Montluel in the Ain region.  Since 2004, this project has consecutively been the twelfth to be carried out and coordinated by the regional federation and is the most important further to a voluntarist policy to promote the european mobility that has been implemented for over ten years. In a context where the inward-looking attitude keeps increasing, the opening onto the world and towards others, interculturality, the strengthening of the professional, linguistic and personal skills constitute the aims of this project.\r\nAlthough every MFR has specifically defined its own aims, common objectives were upstream determined by the steering committee. They concern:\r\n-Significant improvements in language learning.\r\n-The strengthening of integration and adaptation capacities thanks to immersion work in a professional environment.\r\n-The development of professional skills specific to the enterprise, to the professional system of reference through carrying out activities determined beforehand by the partners.\r\n-The discovery of a country of the European Union and its culture.\r\n-The accession to autonomy and self-confidence, the capacity to take care of oneself and the development of adaptability.\r\n-Education in the opening-up to the world and towards others. Far from being innate, openness towards others requires a daily education that reaches its climax during the stay. Young people have a lot of prejudice, their judgment towards foreigners is often negative. Experience in immersion and meetings constitute an excellent means to perceive otherness that, despite differences, reveals more convergence and common grounds.\r\nThe ambition of this project is to enable 351 students in vocational or technical high school to enjoy a three-week stay in a European country selected by their MFR. They are in fifth, sixth or final year of high school with the following options: Services to people and territories, Business studies, Horticultural production, technicians , sale in pet shop, management, administration, landscaping, farm management. They are between 16 and 20 years old, most of them coming from a rural background, they think of living and working in a rural environment. They have little or no experience of mobility abroad, consequently we are convinced that this stay will benefit them and their future employability. In the sectors: Service and Business, the proportion of female students is very important, it is the opposite in the other sectors.\r\nIn methodological terms, project activities are managed by the promoter and the MFR involved and distributed between them. The promoter is in charge of promotion, of administrative and financial management, of the follow-up and technical support, of the quality control of the project and its dissemination. The steering committee made up of the 3 official representatives appointed by the promoter, of the director of the MFR regional federation ,of the directors of every MFR and the technical committee made up of the 3 representatives and of every project leader, plan and supervise all project stages. To do that, numerous meetings are planned.\r\nThen, after appointing a project leader,  every  MFR involved is responsible for preparing, informing students and their families, organizing the  stays,  for the follow-up and on-the-spot support, for determining training course work and the restitution work required, for the exploitation and valuation of the acquired skills and for the dissemination of the results. All this should be achieved in accordance with the schedule of conditions determined by the promoter and the steering committee.\r\nIn the short or middle term, the results and impacts expected concern the widening of the beneficiaries\u2019 professional skills, improvement in linguistic understanding, above all orally, the awareness of the necessity to practise  another language than theirs so as to be able to exchange and communicate in any circumstances, personal development, a synonym of self- confidence and autonomy.\r\nIn the long term, the aim is the opening onto Europe, the awareness that we are all European citizens with rights and duties as well, the desire to travel and grow rich of the interculturality that ennobles every individual.  Above all the aim is to enhance the employability of every beneficiary.", "http://www.levertraining.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-013974_15"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KY5"}
