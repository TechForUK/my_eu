One is a primary school from Slovenia, the second is a Town twinning organization from Sedbergh. The project starts in May 2017 and ends in March2018. Around 15 participants (students, aged 14 and 15) from Slovenia will take part in the activities, the English side will have around 15 participants (students, aged between 14 and 17) Each side will provide mentors and leadres.\r\nThe leaders of the project are experienced teachers who have a lot of experience working with young people. Both have been leaders of school exchanges in the past. What we find extremely important is that leaders from both countries know the participants well which enables us to prepare the activities in a way that they are suitable for all the individual participants. \r\nBoth organisations started exchanges in 2005 when the twinning agreement between Zre\u010de and Sedberg was signed. Many exchanges have been organised so far.\r\nThe title of the project is Mostovi - Bridges, the main theme of the project is culture and literature. We will connect both culture and literature to castles. Thej play an important role in the history of both countries. And not only that, there were three castles in Zre\u010de in the past and one was in the vicinity of Sedbergh. The participants from Zre\u010de will visit the castle in Carlisle and Windsor.\r\nWith the project we want to prove that though two nations are different, there are also many things that are common or the same. \r\nThe project will consit of two parts. The first exchange (A1) in Sedbergh in the UK and the second (A2) in Zre\u010de in Slovenia. All the differences do not make friendship between people from both countries impossible. On the contrary it enriches individuals. This is something we must be aware of, especially after Brexit.\r\nThe children with special needs will have the opportunity to actively take part in all of the activities, we will have a similar number of boys and girls involved in the project. \r\nWith the project we want to promote the cooperation between the twin towns Sedberg and Zre\u010de in the future, which is only possible if young people from both towns are involved.\r\nAll of the activities will be followed by evaluations each day.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI02-KA105-014117_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA10"}
