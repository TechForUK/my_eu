This project provides unlimited possibilities to pursue the European dimension of education and contribute to quality improvement and school credibility in a wider region. European and national projects have become an inseparable part of schooling process. Moreover, they provide students and teachers great opportunities for the further vocational and language preparation. We decided to cooperate with reliable and time-proved partners in order to realize project activities such as Yale College Wrexham, Integrated Secondary School Sokolnice and Secondary vocational and electrical training school Plze\u0148. We appreciate their willingness to collaborate and exchange skills and knowledge with our participants. In addition, we acknowledge their goodwill to let us use their modern classrooms, training centers with high-tech equipment, social partners, and professional tutors for the project activities. \r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at students and professional school teachers. The mutual aim of both groups is education in various types of international schools, improvement of comprehensive, professional, and language competence and in particular participants' individual and professional development. The students' educational stay is aimed at increasing their competitiveness in finding employment at the European labor market, gaining new professional and improving their existing language competences, supporting the informal education and obtaining new experiences from foreign countries, mainly about their ways of education, work habits and living in general. On the other hand, pedagogical participants have an opportunity to acquire new information and knowledge about their area of tuition, grow professionally, improve the visibility and recognition of their qualification and optimize the abilities gained in informal education. The project is aimed at supporting the cooperation at high level of quality, with special emphasis on model and method exchange, as well as exchange of common criteria and principles for ensuring high value of vocational tuition and preparation.\r\n\r\nIn total 94 project participants will travel abroad, of which 72 are students at initial technical preparation, 12 are teachers as accompanying persons/mentors and 10 are teachers of the technical subjects. The project implementation is divided into 7 intervals in the period from May 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. The teachers involved in project are employees of the Secondary School Handlov\u00e1, who teach or create content for the technical subjects. Teachers are full of enthusiasm and motivation for involvement into reforms resulting in education improvements. The second target group the project is aimed at are students of technical fields of study and bilingual business academy. Students have already acquired basic knowledge during their ongoing education on technical subjects and vocational training. Students that will be sent to Coleg Cambria, will either undergo an intensive course of English language improvement or will expand their knowledge and practical skills of working with digital equipment on web and graphic design. On the other hand, the students that will be chosen for SOUE Plze\u0148 will take part in a practical training in Automatization workshops, Measuring and Electronics workshops and Digital technology workshops. Finally, the students that will visit the partner school ISS Sokolnice will verify their skills in energetics and heavy-current conduit workshops as well as in the Lifelong Learning Centre.\r\n\r\nProject will support expansion of multicultural dialog and mutual tolerance. It will contribute to the increasing creativity and competition among students from different educational systems and cultures.  SO\u0160 Handlova, as a project proposer, expects a smooth course of individual stages and acquired benefits in all targeted groups of students and teachers. Due to the obtained international educational experience, credit of all participants will be reinforced. Based on the teachers' recommendations, we plan to innovate the Scholar educational program and selected curricula. We will explore the new opportunities and sources for acquiring new equipment for vocational classrooms and their modernization. We will rely on wealth of experience from our partner organizations. We expect an increased motivation of students, leading to excellent educational results and improvement of language competences. All participants will obtain Europass Mobility and Certificate.           \r\n\r\nFrom the partner side, we expect the reinforcement in mutual collaboration as well as presentations of their experiences concerning project realizations, innovations in education, rebuilding of practical educational centers, introduction of new disciplines, upbringing and educational problems in different school systems and last but not least we expect suggestions for future cooperation.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SK01-KA102-000061_3"], ["7AB", "SKILLS +", "Coleg Cambria", 430913.0, "In the years until 2020, the EU youth generation will diminish from 90 to 81 million. This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners. The methodological framework of the project builds on existing methods and practices which are already in use in the partners\u2019 countries or developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF, etc.) where CPV and other partner organisations are involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. The project proposal will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES and FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities. The project intends to have a significant impact on public and private key actors of the partners\u2019 countries and the respective national, regional, local.  The project contributes to enhance partners\u2019 national VET systems through:\r\n\r\n- the promotion of internationalisation and mobility strategies, linked with the quality assurance systems for placements, monitoring contents and recognition of skills acquired  abroad;\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the quality in VET also significantly contributing to the further development of the competence of staff organising mobility as well as teachers, trainers and tutors involved. The EU added value of the project is, furthermore, the support provided to the implementation of common EU tools and methods for mobility quality assurance. for the implementation of an effective ECVET system for comparability and portability of VET qualifications in full compliance with EQF principles.

The BFS Grafenau, the teachers and instructors of both schools as well as those of the taking up institution, the Coleg Cambria are further involved in Wrexham/Wales.

The course contents are tuned to essential aspects of the later field of activity of the students. Thus the subject fields general communication and presentation rules, phoning and correspondence, complaint management, main features of the personnel guidance and analysis of target groups should be treated by the single lecturers in their groups. Moreover, general rules of intercultural trade are not only got to know, but are also deepened in exercises. Besides, different open teaching forms are applied.\r\n\r\nThe second stone consists in the fact that the students visit different places of interest of the surroundings and discuss with the tourism specialist staff there the marketing plans and strategies.

For both, the private academy for special education and the Katholische Jugendf\u00fcrsorge Augsburg, it is a concern to educate and train well-qualified professionals of social work for the European labor market. On the other hand they want to get well-qualified professionals for their own areas of responsibility and to get their offered jobs occupied.\r\n\r\nBy the increasing mobility within Europe former trainees und students request the private academy for special education to describe and confirm the skills acquired in their training in order to obtain the recognition of their formal training abroad and get proper access to the labor market at their trained level and according to their degree.

The initiators of the project already saw the advantages of implementing this model in UK schools, considering this model ( the only known model for VET schools) as an opportunity to respond to the needs and interests of school, of teachers and of students. The Yale Model is based on a few simple, easy to apply principles, but unknown for Romanian teachers. Everything is about a real need to RE-form the school, to pass from formalization to education, to convert school reactivity in school proactivity and, most important, to bring educational excellence by passing from imposed teaching-learning to the pleasure of teaching-learning. There will be a number of 30 participants, teachers of all kind, from Valeriu Braniste Technical College. There will be a number of 3 flows, each flow with a number of 10 persons. The project doesn't want to limit to the applicant, there is a vision that the participants will become teaching-learning experts for other schools and trainers for other teachers from Lugoj and all over Romania.\r\nThe training programme includes theoretical activities ( classes) and practical activities (learning by seeing, learning by observing, learning by doing, learning from own experience). Also, there will be as objectives: improvements of teacher communication, English language skills, cultural skills, professional and classroom management.

PARTNERSHIP\r\nThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. \r\nThe first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this new project. \r\nDue to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. \r\nGRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2014 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner. \r\n2. NEEDS \r\nBased upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 10 flows spanning 2 years, from 2015 until 2017, for 150 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO. \r\nWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. \r\nThe linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities. \r\n3. OBJECTIVES \r\nFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2015 until 2017, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding. \r\nHence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. \r\nOn the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 10 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2015 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2015 bidding session. \r\n4. OUTCOMES\r\nThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market. \r\n5. COMPOSITION AND TIMESPANS OF FLOWS \r\nAn overall number of 150 vocational students/apprentices (see qualifications below) are planned to be sent out to COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - LLANDRILLO COLLEGE, grouped in 5 separate flows each.

The  staff training mobilities have a strong common denominator consisting in the acquisition of innovative methods and effective use of technologies for teaching, for an innovative implementation of the processes of teaching / learning, able to contrast phenomena still very frequent in Italy as early school leaving and cyber-bullying in favor of a conscious use of technological tools and the integration of young students in the contexts of education and employment (according to the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy).\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the training packages are of short duration (3 days excluding travel) for the thematic areas: multimedia technologies, mobile technologies, video technologies. These mobilities include the creation of 70% of training activities (training of trainers) and the remaining 30% of job shadowing (direct observation). Short mobilities are 72 and will be implemented in the 6 countries mentioned above. The project also provides training packages of longer duration, two weeks, for the staff who will acquire language skills and in particular  the use of technology in teaching of foreign languages and skills and knowledge of the CLIL method for teachers NOT of foreign language.\r\nThese 10 mobilities will be realized in Spain and in the United Kingdom with host partners specialized in the provision of foreign language courses and CLIL method. Even in this second case the mobilities will be constituted by  a part of training of trainers (about 70% of the duration of mobility) and a part of job shadowing (the remaining 30% of the duration). The mobilities provide in both cases, a survey of the knowledge and skills acquired in the course of mobility by the participant; more realistically participants will realize the acquisition of small parts of very specific learning outcomes, that the beneficiaries may transfer in their job context to address concrete problems of their daily work, and that will allow them to contribute to the methodological changes within their organizations. \r\n\r\nThe detection will be done through specific monitoring tools (GRIDS) aimed to the external evaluation and to self-assessment of learning outcomes.

We will provide them with an intensive training programme specific to our area of expertise (the teaching of young learners) and then they will attend a four week placement with our partner in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe mobility will provide essential vocational experience to enable them to teach English confidently by offering a preparation programme, including sessions on how to teach Young Learners.  These are supplemented with certificates in Sports Leadership (Day Cert) and basic First Aid. An objective of this project is to upskill and address gaps in the learners\u2019 key competencies and as a result make them employable within the language market, either with our organisation or our host agencies. This is a significant impact as our learners' through their mobilities will come into contact with approximately 2500 EU students. This will increase inter-cultural awareness amongst this group and may help inspire and motivate further mobilities European wide from within participating countries.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, participants may then find work teaching English aboard within Europe which helps to promote language learning and linguistic diversity.

The profile of our students requires management internationalization, since in Mallorca, and especially in our town, Calvia, there is a large influx of English tourists, justifying that has a broad business network encompassed in the tourism sector.\r\n* Dual VET: IES Calvi\u00e0 is with another school in Mallorca the most advanced in the implementation of the Dual VET in Kitchen & Gastronomy. Germany is the country that greatly contribute to the improvement of skills of our students for two reasons: 1. There are many foreign residents and 2. the flow of German and British tourists accounted for 70% of the total flow of tourists coming to the islands. These are students have a large practical experience within the workplace and have the need to obtain an official certification that allows them to advance in their consolidation into the labour market. \r\nIn this sense, the experience in the center RBZ1 of Kiel will be decisive, being a center with a much extensive experience in the delivery of Dual VET.\r\n* FP Basic: Students who attend basic need FB are characterized by a degree of motivation, since there are a high number of school leavers that focuses on students attending these studies. The Italian center of the Agenzia delle Colline Astigiane is a privileged place in relation to basic VET, up to the point that has over ten years of experience in this regard.\r\n* Cooking and Gastronomy: Students of this professional family will learn in schools in the UK, Cambria and SCC, to join a company with an innovative organization, as there is only restaurants open to the educational community, that counts with an open service to the public through the possibility of recording orders on a web page. This, along with the skills and competencies acquired in a British center will contribute decisively when their integration into the labor market in Mallorca.\r\n* Laboratory of Image and Sound: laboratory students have a particularly oriented cosmopolitanism  profile, appreciation of graphic and audiovisual expression, multiculturalism, as well as aspects that link them with the growing interdependence of media and communication .

PARTNERSHIPThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. The first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this project.Due to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP.LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2015 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner.2. NEEDS Based upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 8 flows spanning 2 years, from 2016 until 2018, for 120 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLOWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. The linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities.3. OBJECTIVESFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2016 until 2087, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the  vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding.Hence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. On the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 8 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2016 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2016 bidding session.4. OUTCOMESThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market.5.

Discussions among teachers on issues concerning emerging new job profiles, new forms of work organization which affect training and educational needs and provision represent the main rationale of the project proposal. New emerging competencies and learning concepts, also taking into account the needs of microenterprises are required by both sectors: the traditional simple and repetitive tasks are evolved to multidisciplinary tasks in order to deliver more complex products and services.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. It takes independence, initiative and flexibility to work abroad. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad will involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment. The partnership brings together partners from different countries (IT,DE,NL,SLO,IE,UK,GR,ES,FR,DK,LT) and is built ad hoc to include the necessary expertise to successfully reach the goals of the project. Skills and competences are multidisciplinary and integrated in a consistent way with the tasks and phases of project development. Many of the partners already collaborated with CPV in other EU-funded projects thus developing a strong mutual trust. C.A.T.ER.P.I.LLA.R project is designated for 104 17-18 years old learners, attending the fourth year at vocational and technical upper secondary institutes. The schools involved, encompass a range of professional curricula: Tourism and Hospitality; Agriculture, Biotechnology, Winemaking.The methodological framework adopted in identifying and describing the main occupational profile \u2013 related units of LOs to be acquired/improved by learners built on: careful analysis of current study programmes and existing methods and practices developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF, etc.) where CPV and Consortium's members have been involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. Thus, the proposed model provides a \u201ccommon language\u201d for describing competences and their acquisition and offers a way to relate these competences to specific training programmes. The project will last 18 months and will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES (the work placement will last 30 days (travel excluded) and may include 2 days of induction. In the choice of work placement companies, the project partners will be supported by the E.R.M.E.S. database including more than 370 EU companies); Consortium and foreign partners will ensure an efficient mentoring and supervision arrangements of mobile participants through monitoring documents, monitoring visits by tutors; FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities.The project seeks to have significant impacts not just through the mobilities which the project will naturally promote but also by focusing on the sustainability of the multilateral ties that will ensure. By offering work-based vocational education and training in another country, the primary expected impact of the mobility experience on the participants is a direct and measureable improvement in their professional competencies and work-related skills. Other personal and social impact include: development of language, ICT and teamwork skills; increased intercultural awareness; increased level of independence, confidence and open mindedness.As to the participating organisations, the impact will include: -exposure to work-based learning practices in other EU countries; - development of openness and cooperation with schools from other countries; - strengthening of the EU dimension to the Consortium members\u2019 activities; - improvements in VET methods, systems and processes, development of interdisciplinary approaches.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005083_21"], ["7AB", "EXPERIENTA EUROPEANA \u00ceN DOMENIUL SERVICIILOR  \u201cLEARNING BY DOING\u201d", "COLEG CAMBRIA", 119645.0, "The mobility project is submitted by the \"JOANES KAJONI\" Vocational High School from Romania, in partnership with Coleg Cambria from Wrexham, Wales.The Hospitality, Tourism and Beauty areas have had a dynamic evolution, and the demands from clients are continuously growing.

We will provide them with an intensive training programme specific to our area of expertise (the teaching of young learners) and then they will attend a four week placement with our partner in Spain.Vocational Sector: Education & Language  Objectives & Impact: The mobility will provide essential vocational experience to enable them to teach English confidently by offering a preparation programme, including sessions on how to teach Young Learners.  These are supplemented with certificates in Sports Leadership (Day Cert) and basic First Aid.An objective of this project is to upskill and address gaps in the learners\u2019 key competencies and as a result make them employable within the language market, either with our organisation or our host agencies.  On return from the project, participants will be offered employment with UKLC which will give them the chance to work with EU students, gain further teaching practice and further increase their employability. This is a significant impact as our learners' through their mobilities will come into contact with approximately 2500 EU students. This will increase inter-cultural awareness amongst this group and may help inspire and motivate further mobilities European wide from within participating countries.Furthermore, participants may then find work teaching English aboard within Europe which helps to promote language learning and linguistic diversity.

The aim of students \u2018internship is to increase their applicability on the European labour market, to acquire new professional skills, to strengthen language competences, to support  informal learning, to acquire experiences and information  about  educational system and way of life of foreign countries during staying in visiting country. The aim of internship for teaching staff is professional development, possibility to acquire new information and knowledge in their fields, to improve the acceptance of qualification and skills acquired by informal learning.

For this activity the school kept the partners for the students \u2018trainings from the Renewable Energy courses, Automobile Mechatronics and Socio and cultural Animation and sought a new partner for the course of Metalworking Production, as it is the 1st time we will have trainings in this area. For each gflow, we included an accompanying teacher, who will stay with the students during the 1st week and help them to integrate in the companies, the culture and group environment. Most of these students are under 18 and travel abroad for the first time.For the A2 activity, we kept the work plan for graduate students, so as to carry out a 150-day mobility in companies. Comparing to the year before, we reduced the number of mobilities from 8 to 6, since we will have a lower number of graduate students this year. For this activity, we kept the same partners, considering the good performance shown. However, and bearing in mind the previous experience, we believe it would be very helpful for them to have a teacher to do the monitoring and integration in this period of mobility. We realized that many students would even like to try this European experience, but they end up quitting as they are afraid of going alone and without the support of a teacher.In 2015 we started to organize the mobility for the 10th grade students to provide them a period of training in schools / training centers abroad, so as to prevent failure and dropout, and to increase their motivation to attend professional courses and their language learning. Both students and parents reacted very positively to the innovative proposal, which registered a high level of interest. So, for this A3 activity, we decided to keep the same number of mobilities (total of 30, divided into 3 flows). In what concerns the selection of partners, we took into account the targeted training areas in reference schools. Since these students are under 18, we included in each flow, a teacher who will accompany them throughout the whole period of mobility.For all the participating students, we will work on the validation of training modules according to the ECVET and provide support on the award of the Europass document.In what concerns the staff - A4 activity,  we foresee to organize 10 mobilities. We increased both the number of flows and partners to cover different training realities and to enhance enriching experiences for the participants, which will surely be useful for their professional performance in CIOR.In summary, the application proposal provides a total of 81 mobilities among 4 types of activity to be held during the year 2016/2017, according to the start and end dates of the project, 61 of these mobilities are for students, 11 mobilities are for accompanying teachers and 10 mobilities are planned for the professional development of Staff.

Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage.

So as to achieve the goals set out in this strategy, we seek to develop a gradually more comprehensive project in terms of mobility opportunities, especially for young people attending vocational education. There are already very positive effects on learning, methodologies, performance, motivation of students and teachers, as well as on the organizational culture of our School, highlighting as well European citizenship in its different dimensions. The participation in mobility programs and the contact with different cultures/ realities have contributed to the enrichment of the participants' professional curricula, the acquisition of transversal skills and the development of language skills, which can only be achieved in activities that take place in contexts of diversified training.\r\nIn what concerns the School management, the implementation of the mobility projects allowed establishing teamwork dynamics, flexibility and time management, diversification of intervention strategies among students and a greater openness to innovative projects. It also contributed to the increased sense of belonging to the school community and to the sense of identity of the School.\r\nPursuing the implementation of the Internationalization Strategy, and taking into account the increase in the number of students at school, as well as the excellent results achieved, we intend to maintain the activities developed in the previous application, extending the possibility that more students from the 1st and 2nd years of the professional courses may participate in mobilities, which favour the contact with the realities of other schools/ training centres from European countries.\r\nThus, the GPS-5 project foresees the execution of three types of activity, addressed to all the elements of the school community, and to be carried out according to the planned schedule:\r\nA1 - 25 mobilities (5 flows/ 5 groups/ 5 students) for the 12th grade students (55 days for the development of practical training in companies) in partner institutions from Spain, Malta, Italy and Austria; and 6 mobilities of 150 days in companies for graduate students, in partner institutions from Spain, Italy and Poland;\r\nA2 - 50 mobilities of 16 days for periods of training in schools/ training centres abroad for the 1st year students (30 students) and the 2nd year (20 students) from professional courses in partner organizations from the United Kingdom, Croatia, Austria, Poland and Finland;\r\nA3 - 10 staff training mobilities abroad with partner organizations from Greece, Spain, Cyprus, and Finland.\r\nThe increase in the number of mobilities in A2 aims not only to respond to the students\u2019 requests, but essentially to promote educational success, increase the motivation levels for the school/ professional journey and thus fight against school dropout among young people from disadvantaged socio-economic contexts. With the previous participation of the 1st year students in mobilities, there has been an improvement in the levels of students performance, in terms of attendance, behaviour and reduction of modules left to do. It has also increased the number of applicants seeking the school just because it provides learning opportunities beyond the traditional classroom/ workshop context.\r\nSince most of these students are under 18, we consider it essential to include in each flow a teacher who will accompany them throughout the mobility period. In the case of A1, where there is also a large number of underage students who have never been abroad, the monitoring of a teacher in the first week of mobility is of the utmost importance in order to support the students\u2019 integration in the social, cultural and labour context.\r\nThe changes in the partnerships are related to the change of our courses, and we tried to adapt the flows and the labour contexts to the profile of the courses and to the participants themselves. In the selection of the partners, we took into account the training areas of the groups involved so that the participants could observe and compare the educational and formative realities of the countries involved.\r\nIn the longer period mobilities, the official language of the host country was also taken into account, so that the language barrier would not be an obstacle to the efficient performance of the planned activities/ tasks.

They are for students of various departments (Mechanic-mechatronic, Mechanic of PC networks, Technical lyce\u00e9, Digital media graphic designer and Business academy \u2013 bilingual study). Our aim is to offer these internships to the best students of each department. According to our previous project experiences the internship is the high motivation for students to achieve good study results. \r\nStudents of technical departments will check their knowledge in the workshops and Energy centre in the partner school Stredn\u00e1 \u0161kola elektrotechnick\u00e1 a energetick\u00e1 Sokolnice, the Czech republic (1st turn activity A1).

In our school we should build the Centre for vocational education and training till 2019. Till this year we have to use specialized vocational classrooms of our partner school in Sokolnice.  \r\nStudents of technical departments, mainly mechanic-mechatronic, use the internship for acquisition of new competences in the field of automatization, robots programming, modern buildings, camera systems, intelligent wiring, and modern electronic systems. We have only some basic panels for students which are used for residential installations.

We consider that the possibility of participating in mobility projects works as a factor of attractiveness for vocational education and of motivation for students\u2019 educational success.\r\nIn what concerns the staff, the mobilities are aimed at improving the skills of the technical and pedagogical team, through the sharing of good practices among professionals from similar schools and training centres, on issues of high relevance for the promotion of educational success and integration of young people, as well as at building a real articulation of European policies in the field of education and vocational training.\r\nFor all those involved, the participation in mobility activities has contributed to the development of non-measurable personal skills related to adaptation to diverse cultural and professional contexts, language skills, European citizenship awareness and tolerance towards diversity.\r\nAs one of the objectives of EP Cior is to provide all its students and staff with the opportunity to make at least one mobility during their training cycle, the Project Office intends to consolidate its internationalization strategy through the realization of the sixth edition of the GPS project, which includes 3 types of activity:\r\n- A1 - 25 mobilities (5 flows/ 5 classes/ 5 students) for the development of training periods in companies for students from the 12th grade (55 days) in partner entities from Spain, Malta, Italy, Austria and Poland; and 32 mobilities (4 flows/ 8 students) of 14 days for periods of training in schools/ training centres abroad, for students attending the 1st year of vocational courses, in partnership with entities from the UK, Greece, Bulgaria and Finland.\r\n- A2 - 8 ErasmusPro mobilities of 100 days in companies for newly graduated students, in Partner entities from Spain, Italy, Germany and the UK.\r\n- A3 - 2 preparatory visits to the German and British partners;\r\n- A4 - 10 mobilities for training staff abroad in partnership with entities from Ireland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.\r\nSince most students are under 18 and have never been abroad, we consider it essential to include in each flow a teacher who will accompany them throughout the mobility period or during the first week in the case of the 12th grade students. This monitoring is of great importance to support the integration of students in the social, cultural and work context.\r\nIn the selection of partners, we took into account the training areas of the students involved as well as the quality of the partnerships already established. The changes in the partnerships aim to allow the participants to observe and compare the educational and training realities of the countries involved, thus adapting the flows and the working contexts to the profile of the courses and the participants themselves. The partnerships established for the implementation of this project can be consulted at http://www.cior.pt/index.php?page=1&id=28.\r\nRegarding ErasmusPRO, EP Cior proposes to increase the number of mobilities and shorten its duration bearing in mind the growing number of applicants, their requirements and the pre-selection process for young graduates at the end of the current school year, so as to provide them a working experience within Europe, boosting thus their employment opportunities.\r\nThe selection criteria for participants will remain identical to those from previous years, taking into account the equal opportunities for gender and special educational needs. They also ensure to any student interested in participating in a mobility the possibility of being selected. \r\nThe dissemination activities, both internal and external, are duly planned and included in the School Annual Activity Plan.\r\nThe assessment of the GPS6 project includes indicators for the achievement, the process as well as the analysis of its impact on the School and the community.", "http://www.cambria.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-047020_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL12"}
