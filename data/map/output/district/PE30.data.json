There are two new study fields in the project:_aircraft maintenance and safety and security. There are also two new partners: a central organisation of Italian chambers of commerce fro Veneto and a college from North-Spain.  The aim of the project is to offer students qualified work placement periods according to the priciples of ECVET. Teacher and trainers will during their exchange discuss and agree about the regonition and validation of learning outcomes. Students' and teachers' mobilities will be carried out at the same time always when possible. The sending and receiving organisations will agree on the mobilities usually by using e-mail, learning outcomes and assesment will be written to the Learning Agreement.

These placements will expose participants to new people, new places and new cultural norms, which aims to make them highly receptive to new approaches in the teaching and learning of unfamiliar skills This alternate context will be used to reinforce the Project AVocET goal which is to improve vocational skills capability and enhance the employability of Apprentices, and support teaching Professional Development.\r\nThe content of the project, with a primary focus on experiential learning in a host-employer workplace, will facilitate the acquisition\r\nof both vocational/technical and professional skills and social/language skills, whilst extended exposure to a different culture and lifestyle will help to develop positive attitudes, promote European citizenship/integration, build self-confidence and encourage IVT participants to explore pan-European employment opportunities.

The goal is controlled and manageable growth in mobility numbers. International mobility is financed by Erasmus+ programme, schools own funding and the funding channelled by National Board of Education of Finland. Mobilities financed by VET Mobility Charter form significant share of international activities of Sedu. At the same time strong allocation of resources in developing home internationalization supports the quality of mobility actions in the future.  The statistics collected in January 2016 indicate that mobility numbers had increasing trend in 2015. Staff exchanges even went beyond the set goals. We estimate the numbers to stay in growing trend in 2016. In learner mobilities we seek to pursue horizontal increase in relation to numbers of study fields and unitsparticipating in international mobility rather than huge increase in total numbers. Taitaja2016, national Skills competition finals organised by Sedu in May 2016 allows us to bring international actions in VET to spotlight. Significant regional adult education provider JAKK merged in Sedu in January 2016. Number of students went up to 20 000 when counting all education forms. We seek to support the integration activities of JAKK by joined mobility periods.  In the beginning, the emphasis will be in staff mobilities in the field of logistics, which has traditionally been the strong point in JAKKs education provision.In the adult learner mobility, we want to see growing numbers in the coming years. The steering group of Sedu Adult Education set the goals for 2016-2017 for 5 long term adult learner mobilities with the idea of increasing the number up to 20 by the year 2020. Apprenticeship training took even stronger goals by deciding to coordinate a national Erasmus + KA 1 for apprenticeship providers. A new strategy was adopted in January 2016 (attached) in Sedu. It covers the years 2016 to 2020. In the strategy internationality is highlighted and even more visible  than previously. The vision is: Sedu \u2013 local and global forerunner in vocational competence building.  More detailed description of the vision states that \u201c Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks. Four strategic priorities will be the following: student and staff welfare, partnerships and cooperation with the work life, resources and new megatrends. The implementation of the strategical priorities will be defined in action plans to be published by the end of April 2016. International actions are set to be part of priority: partnerships and cooperation with the work life. The feedback received for VET mobility charter application will be adopted as part of the goal setting process for the future international activities. The indicators of international actions will be more focused and more limited in number. Increasing numbers of adult education learner and trainer mobility will be set as one of the priorities as suggested in VET mobility charter feedback. Erasmus+ KA1 instrument allows new way of raising quality in VET by making it possible to bring in international industry lecturers. This will be piloted in the field of agriculture and bioeconomy.New megatrends as priority will also touch the goal setting of international mobility. According to SITRA key megatrends include the global sustainability crisis, the accelerating pace of technological development \u2013 and its impacts on society \u2013 and the intensification of global tensions and everyday interdependence. Naturally, these trends affect the context to which we are training our learners. International mobility allows us to contribute to increasing tolerance of learners and teachers/trainers and by this way lowering tensions between people from different cultures in Europe where the numbers of asylum seekers has risen tremendously.To name one practical example, our partner in Sweden has been a forerunner in educating immigrants from numerous cultural backgrounds. We will be able to offer our teachers and students placements in this school to learn how to see opportunities not only challenges. In latest technological innovations in vocational pedagogics we can even be in a position to share some innovations (Opinlakeus network). Aming other things one of the definitions of the vision: \u201d Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks\u201d will affect implementation of VET Mobility Charter mobilities. To implement the term \u201cboldly\u201d will bring with it even stronger emphasis on teacher/trainer work placements abroad. Longer term staff mobilities will support the competence building of staff which for example will be engaged in education export activities.
