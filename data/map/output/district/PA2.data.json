However, the discourse about climate change often focuses on scientific facts as well as detailed descriptions of the catastrophic consequences of inaction in the future. Jeni Cross, sociology professor at Colorado State University, defends that that contrary to common sense, giving information to an audience about a problem does not necessarily lead to behaviour change and she emphasises the importance of highlighting the personal stories of those who are taken steps to reduce their environmental impact to inspire others to do the same. Authors G. Gardner and P. Stern explain in a similar fashion that when it comes to global problems, statistical information rarely leads to behaviour change while authors Dan Heath and Chip Heath argue that focusing on 'what's broken' (about the energy system that uses fossil fuels and is therefore responsible for climate exchange), instead of emphasising 'what works' may lead to apathy instead of action - people are less likely to take part in the transition to a low-carbon future.In this Erasmus+ project, we would like to address the above two points. We want to focus communication about climate change on the personal stories of those who make change happen. With the experience of three partner organisations in the fields of adult education, e-learning and environmental literacy we want to support people and other organisations undertake small actions as well as start new small CO2-saving projects. We will focus on personal stories of people reducing their environmental impact through the Carbon Conversations programme. The programme, managed by The Surefoot Effect, focuses on values, emotions, and identity and over 3,000 participants in Britain have shown to reduce their personal carbon footprint by 1 T CO2 a year on average and pledged to halve it in the long term. We therefore want to adapt Carbon Conversations that uses social, economic and cultural references to carbon emissions in Britain to the social, economic, and cultural backgrounds of Spain and Lithuania. Volunteer facilitators run the programme in Britain for participants and in this project the three partners will collaborate to develop the volunteer networks in Spain and Lithuania.We will also focus on narrating a story of the benefits of a low-carbon future by showcasing 200 projects that have saved or are saving CO2 in Europe but also in some neighbouring countries and other large industrialised countries. These examples will be displayed in the project's Online Open Interactive Educational Platform. This way, we can show what options are available for people to reduce their environmental impact so that i) others can replicate them; ii) we can contribute to create a positive picture of a carbon-neutral economy, an 'optimistic tale of the future'.Eco-innovation is seen as a one of the key enablers of the transition to a green economy under the EU's startegy ECO 2020. In this  project we want work in the adult education field to develop innovative methods to support people and organisations reduce their environmental impact. The Surefoot Effect will contribute with experience in environmental education and literacy while DomSpain and Ziniu Kodas will add their experience working in digital technology and e-learning programmes and community engagement, including working with groups of people with fewer opportunities, respectively. The skills and knowledge gained through the project will increase participants' learning and life opportunities and encourage them to take part actively in modern society within a field whose importance is expected to increase over the coming decades.Our primary target groups will be i) educational as well as environmental organisations in our partner countries, willing to train inthe Carbon Conversations programme and become volunteer facilitators and ii) organisations and individuals who would like to undertake CO2-saving projects and personal actions by looking at what other organisations and people are doing elsewhere. The project needs to be carried out internationally because in order to present a positive picture about the future, we must work with partners from different backgrounds, including cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. The project must also work at the transnational level because often, national economic policy determines a higher or a lower use of clean energy or public transport, for example. Thus, citizens in Lithuania will not go about purchasing renewable energy or travelling by train in the same way as citizens in Spain. Having examples from both contexts means that a wider number of people can identify with at least one of these examples and will therefore be able to replicate them.", "http://www.surefoot-effect.com", "The Surefoot Effect, CIC", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA204-024544_coordinator"], ["6HW", "Environmental Learning Illustrated", "The Surefoot Effect, CIC", 147856.0, "This project draws on the European Union's commitment to reduce the environmental impact of its member states and to a low-carbon economy, and the need to develop educational alternatives that promote these goals. This view is expressed by the European Commission and various key papers such as 'A Healthy and Sustainable Environment for Present and Future Generations' (2014), as well by the Union's commitment to the global 2015 Paris Agreements that sets reductions in carbon emissions for the decades to come. At the same time, the European Union has asserted that legislation alone is not enough to achieve these goals and that \"NGOs and citizens exercising their participatory rights\" will be essential to implement the change that is needed. There is also growing evidence that shows that in the case of climate and carbon emissions, these targets might be missed. \r\n\r\nWe at The Surefoot Effect think that much work is needed in terms of expanding the knowledge and experience necessary to motivate individuals, governments, companies and the civil society to contribute to both social and economic development while reducing our dependency on energy and resources and thus reducing our economic impact. In this sense, we see education as key, and namely education of adults with different backgrounds whose expertise could prove to be when integrated in comprehensive learning programmes. In this project, we would like to take our organisation's knowledge of environmental problems, including climate change, as well as our experience developing activities to help people and organisations reduce these problems with the experience that our partners bring to create an innovative programme that aims at helping people make informed choices about how they can contribute. In order to do that, we will be using new methodologies and an innovative approach based on the opportunities that new technologies that will see the use of illustration and a graphic novel, both used to explain key concepts.\r\n\r\nWe will work partners from Italy, Poland, and Austria who bring valuable experience to the project. Volontariato Torino is an umbrella organisation based in the north-western Italian city of Turin. Their previous work with a wide range of organisations, from those working with the elderly, to others working in prisons or the environment, will facilitate the development of the early stages of the project, namely decisions on content of the e-learning programme by creating a survey and interviewing adults about their current knowledge on environmental affairs as well as how they would like to see the programme structured in a way that it responds to the needs of people without a scientific background on the subject. The Centre for Education and Entrepreneurship Support (CEES) is a non-governmental, non-profit organisation with a focus on enterpreneurship that brings broad experience in the IT area and the creation of various IT solutions such as websites, e-learning platforms, web applications, interactive trainings, or mobile applications. CEES will be responsible for the project web-based platform and guiding and advising the partners to create adequate content for the e-learning programme based on these methodologies, as well as digitalising such content for the platform. E.N.T.E.R specialises in developing dissemination strategies within the EU and produces a wide range of dissemination materials to meet the individual needs of a project. It is also vastly experienced in the organisation of events and in the development of promotional campaigns. This experience in communication will be valuable when developing the concepts that will form the core content of the e-learning programme, particularly the use of illustrations and the graphic novel that will be at the center of the learning methodologies proposed in this project. E.N.T.E.R will also be at the forefront of dissemination activities throughout the funding period, including the implementation of the project's four Multiplier Events.\r\n\r\nIn this project we would therefore like to create an e-learning programme about climate change and other environmental problems by using illustrations and graphic design to explain key concepts and activities of the e-learning programme, so to increase the learning success of the participants, as well as reaching out to more people who do not necessarily have a scientific background in the subjects explained. By adding a graphic novel to the programme, we also expect to reach out to more people outside those who will formally take the course. The novel will be freely available at the project platform for anyone to download. We hope that a lighter read on environmental issues will encourage more people to become interested in the aim of the project, and in following some of the suggestions we propose for people to reduce their environmental impact and even to start new projects.", "http://www.surefoot-effect.com", "The Surefoot Effect, CIC", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036748_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PA2"}
