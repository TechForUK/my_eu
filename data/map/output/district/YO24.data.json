Based on the extrapolation of data relating to the UK, French and German railways [Ref 1], the 500,000 kms of rail [Ref. 2] on the European rail network has an average estimated 5000 rail breaks annually with about 1500 due to weld failure. Although the number of weld failures is relatively small compared to the estimated 11 million alumino-thermic welds on the European network, it still accounts for about 20% of the total 7000\\ rail failures each year [Ref. 3]. There is no current available NDT method for the economic and reliable volumetric examination of alumino-thermic welds. This proposal describes the development of a rapid ultrasonic method for the safe and reliable NDT examination of the entire volume of in-situ alumino-thermic welds. The proposed ultrasonic system could be quickly deployed on track using a clamp-on device. The inspection scans will be carried out in a pre-determined sequence, and then the results compared with defect acceptance criteria that will be generated in the project. To achieve this objective, a rigorous analysis of the material properties, the defect interaction with the ultrasonic beams and the design of optimum scanning procedures will first be carried out. It is expected that the scans will be implemented by means of electronic scanning using novel phased arrays and multiple probes.

Web developers and history educators will form a partnership to design e-learning tools and co-create exemplar online learning activities that make effective use of these tools. These resources will be piloted, peer-reviewed, and disseminated via the existing and continuously expanding online education collaborative platform on European history and heritage \u201cHistoriana\u201d (www.historiana.eu) and at numerous face-to-face training activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project addresses a key area of necessary innovation within history education: the vast potential for Open Educational Resources and Digital Learning. While \u2018traditional\u2019 history education in many countries continues to rely on the teacher and the textbook as the two focal points of every lesson, digital learning can put the student in an active role. It enables them to not only use but interact with all digitalized original sources (such as documentaries, music, interviews, paintings, political cartoons) or tailor-made learning activities prepared by the teacher with the specific curricula and desired learning outcomes in mind. Using ICT in the classroom makes it possible to strengthen collaborative learning, virtual inter-regional and cross-border exchange, and many other learner-centered and competence-based activities. It can make a most relevant and innovative contribution to school education and at the same time immerse students in a digital learning environment, vastly increasing their related key competences and skills with positive implications for their further educational careers, employability, and role as active citizens in an increasingly interconnected digital world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project targets several hundred history, heritage, and citizenship educators who want to use innovative approaches in their daily work, particularly through the utilization of ICT and OER. Educators in this sense can be curriculum developers, textbook authors and developers of other teaching materials and tools, teacher pre-service and in-service trainers, teachers in primary and secondary schools and in higher education, trainee teachers, and also assessment experts, educational advisors and inspectors, educational staff in museums and institutes, and board members of professional associations. The Consortium also invites academics, representatives of educational authorities, school and university students, parents, and the wider public interested in history to join its activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities will give these educators access to a wide selection of high-quality materials and will support them to share teaching ideas and co-create content with their peers from around Europe. The exemplar learning activities envisaged will foster competence-based approaches to the subject based on critical thinking and the ability to analyse content in a balanced way, question and compare interpretations, assess evidence and make independent judgments. By providing easy-to-use services and hands-on training the project will support a large group of educators to become more digitally confident, to act as multipliers with their colleagues, and to transmit their skills to their students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Project Consortium will be composed of an international NGO, a web design company, a school, and two research institutes. Its areas of cooperation will include content sourcing, developing tools and applications, testing and piloting, peer- and expert-reviewing, and dissemination including training and awareness-raising of educators specifically in the field of digital learning and how to integrate ICT and OER in the daily work with their students.

The project offers training and support materials to educators to overcome these difficulties and enable them to facilitate debate, dialogue and discussion in their educational practice.\r\n \r\nThe core idea is that students acquire those social and civic competences that enable them to interact with people that they (fundamentally) disagree with, in a constructive manner. The project will help students to acquire skills such as the ability to listen, to respond to what others are saying, to use neutral language, and to considering alternative interpretations. These are important life skills that will have a positive impact on students, also beyond the school environment.\r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented by a team of schools, universities and associations, selected for their unique expertise and network that they bring to the project.

The educational resources consist of 12 sets of content for dialogue, debate and discussion on contested issues (including the historical context, a description of the issues, a variety of viewpoints and questions that make students think), a teacher\u2019s guide on debate, dialogue and discussions (introducing a range of teaching methods), a teacher\u2019s guide on assessing social and civic competences (including a set of assessment tools), and a training package (to be used to train other teachers on how to use these resources in practice). These educational resources respond to the needs that are identified in the needs assessment in the beginning of the project, and a review of existing teacher\u2019s guides, and assessment tools. The teacher\u2019s guides that are developed in this project will be published in 12 European languages.\r\n \r\nAn ambitious training and development programme with 6 international trainings and 12 multiplier events will contribute to the professional development of at least 350 educators, who together will reach over 70.000 students on an annual basis.\r\n \r\nIn the first international training, a group of 50 teachers who are now teaching in schools, will be trained using a selection of existing resources and assessment tools, which they will critically review. In the next four international training, the core group of educators will be trained in the development of educational resources, through a process of collaborative development, testing and peer-review.

Having contributed to the collaborative design of the educational resources, the core group members will be best suited to share these ideas with colleagues on a national level, and pick those resources for the trainings that are most suited to the local contexts.\r\n \r\nFor these national multiplier events, the core team members will make use of a training package, designed to transfer the knowledge, expertise and outputs build in the project so far, to educators who are not yet familiar with the project.
