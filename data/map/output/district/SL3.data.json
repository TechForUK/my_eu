Cloud promises cheap and flexible services to end-users at a much larger scale than before. However, Cloud business models and technologies are still in their initial hype and characterized by critical early stage issues, which pose specific challenges and require advanced software engineering methods.The main goal of MODAClouds is to provide methods, a decision support system, an open source IDE and run-time environment for the high-level design, early prototyping, semi-automatic code generation, and automatic deployment of applications on multi-Clouds with guaranteed QoS.Model-driven development combined with novel model-driven risk analysis and quality prediction will enable developers to specify Cloud-provider independent models enriched with quality parameters, implement these, perform quality prediction, monitor applications at run-time and optimize them based on the feedback, thus filling the gap between design and run-time. Additionally, MODAClouds provides techniques for data mapping and synchronization among multiple Clouds.MODAClouds innovations thus are: (i)simplify Cloud provider selection favoring the emergence of European Clouds, (ii) avoid vendor lock-in problems supporting the development of Cloud enabled Future Internet applications, (iii) provide quality assurance during the application life-cycle and support migration from Cloud to Cloud when needed.The research is multi-disciplinary and will be grounded on expertise from several research areas. MODAClouds consortium consists of highly recognized Universities and research institutions that will assure a sound scientific progress, SME partners providing expertise on modelling tools, and large companies that assure industry relevance. The MODAClouds approach and tools will be applied on four industrial cases from different domains.", 89662.0, 7210723.0, "MODAClouds", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105624_951277061"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7RB", "Creativity and sports for youth employment", "Champions Factory LTD", 14850.0, "All partner organizations and participants, qualified trainers and staff who have been working in the youth field for the past years will be working together during the project week, and together we intend to show the power of Non-Formal Learning in relation to creativity, sport and transversal skills.\"Creativity and sports for youth employment\" will give special attention and focus will be given to the the needs of youth workers, social workers and Youth Centers who work with young people from all aspects of life especially those who are unemployed, school dropouts and have a difficult background.Venue: Lake Velence (Hungary)Dates:  5-12 September 2016COUNTRIES: Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Romania, Italy, SloveniaParticipants: Promoters will be encouraged to prepare the participants before participating in the training course. Preference should be given to those participants who work or intend to work with young people who are excluded from society.Aims and Issues:The aim of this training course is to increase the knowledge and skills of how the participants can bring out their creativity through non-formal education as well how to be good team players through sports skillls . We aim that once back in their youth organisations the participants will implement what they have learnt and spread the skills earned in this training course to the young people they work with and therefore act as multipliers in order to help the young people use these skills in order to help them to enter the employment world .The Objectives:- To promote as education through sports as a powerful tool for developing creativity;- To improve professional competences of youth workers/leaders, which will help them to facilitate activities with young people with learning orientated approach;- To bring out the creative side in each of the participants;- To develop the creative side of participants with learning through sports;- To learn how to become multipliers of creativity and bring out the transversal skills in young people;- To learn how to become multipliers of creativity within their community;- To bring out the transversal skills in young people using non formal approaches;- To ensure deeper understanding of what is a learning process;- To develop essential facilitation skills;- To develop through peer learning essential facilitation skills;- To create a framework for facilitation based on non-formal education and self-directed learning;- To promote an open and creative training environment for non-formal learning;- To bring a theoretical background of facilitation into a practical framework;- To work towards the creation of new partnerships and/or projects using various support mechanisms, as Erasmus +;The basics of our methodologies are active co-operative learning combining experience and theory implementation. This way we will define our methods: learning by games, round-table conference, moderated discussions, sports education, team building activities, team work skills, learning by doing, plenary sessions, interactive work based on advanced preparations, creative workshops with coaching.It is sometimes said that in international projects cultural stereotypes might affect the working procedure and the team spirit. The group leaders will prepare the participants in advance for the possible conflicts and will work on that the participants will be tolerant and respectful with each other. The proposed games, workshops and discussions will also serve this purpose as the participants will be able to spend long time with mixed groups. We will also organise cultural evenings where promoters will have the opportunity to show aspects of their country, region and language. This will enhance the acceptance and enforce social inclusion in practice.We plan activities for enhancing the process of NFL. All activities will be targeted. That means all activities will be organized and structured according to our objectives. Moreover we will focus on the participants' motivation and interest during the training period. As soon as the project will be approved by the NA we will search and ask for the participants' learning and practical experiences and needs for self-improvement and so we will plan our daily agenda of NFL accordingly.

Internships in foreign countries are seen as highly significant at the Hertha Firnberg Schools, since they constitute an excellent preparation for the occupation-related practical as well as theoretical training, and the so-called \u00ab Vorpr\u00fcfung zur Reife- und Diplompr\u00fcfung \u00bb (exam taken just before the \u00abA-level \u00bb/school leaving exam and which is seen as part of the \u00ab A-level \u00bb) at the end of the fourth year.

The teachers have all worked in the hospitality industry and dispose of international experience. Pupils are trained in restaurant service in as well as in the kitchen to be prepared to work in upmarket hotels and restaurants, offices. A training at the reception desk is also part of the curriculum.  The linguistic as well as intercultural competence are taught in the language courses as well as in the optional course for intercultural competence. Students practice simple every-day conversations and complex professional situations by doing role plays. They also get special support by native speaker teachers.\r\nIn order to anchor the spirit of the idea of European mobility in our students\u2019 as well as their parents\u2019 heads, a yearly information evening takes place at our school. The students and their parents get to know about the advantages of the Erasmus + programme and receive necessary practical information in order to successfully participate in this programme. Further information is available at our website. Even on our open-house days we inform about the possibility of doing an internship abroad and we also motivate other schools to participate. \r\nUndoubtedly, students having completed an internship abroad, have acquired a high level of linguistic, technical as well as personal competence. Thus the quality of the  final practical and theoretical exams (\u201eVorpr\u00fcfung zur Reifepr\u00fcfung\u201c and \u201eA-level\u201c)rises significantly. Without any doubt, many pupils who have stayed in a foreign country for a certain period of time, show readiness to integrate Europe-wide mobility into their future career plans.
