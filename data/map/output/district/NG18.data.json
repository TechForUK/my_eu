A single Microdry unit will run off mains electricity be capable of drying a room in just 10% of the time taken by current technologies. We will develop an intelligent control system that will measure the reflected microwaves to determine residual moisture content and adjust the power output accordingly to maximise efficiency. The Microdry system will require no human intervention and will communicate to an end user when the drying process is finished. The magnitude and frequency of floods are likely to increase in the future as a result of climate change i.e. higher rainfall intensities and rising sea levels. Equally, the impact of flood events will increase, because in excess of 50 million European citizens now live in areas at risk of flooding with business and industry also located in such areas. Current drying operations require up to 8 weeks before remedial work can be undertaken on the building. This extends the time required before a building can revert to normal use with economic and social consequences. To remedy this situation we need to develop an emitter to direct the microwave energy to target areas without regular human intervention. This will use a feedback system to measure moisture content and actively control microwave power to the emitter. Telecommunications components will provide communication between the unit and operator and comprehensive safety features will ensure that microwave hazards are eliminated.", 32156.0, 1167188.0, "MICRODRY", null, null, null, "http://microdry.pera.com", "http://www.rainbow-int.co.uk", null, "fp7_107639_994868085"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5BH", "Increasing international knowledge and experience of West Nottinghamshire College Students", "West Nottinghamshire College of Further Education, Mansfield", 178930.0, "Through transnational cooperation between the six institutions, this project aims to produce high quality outcomes for participants,  reinforce the internationalisation, capacity building and modernisation strategies of the Vision WNC.

By 2020, the goal of European Council is that at least 6% of all 18-34 year-olds with a VET background be granted a learning experience abroad. According to Cedefop Mobility Scoreboard, that monitors VET mobility, EU performance for 2017 in terms of ensuring quality for mobility is considered unsatisfactory.\r\nThe adoption of ECVET (European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training) draws attention to the capacity of individual countries to facilitate a system to support and monitor progress in ECVET implantation. It is being increasingly recognized, that apart from system capacity, it is crucial that teachers have the knowledge and skills to promote such learner mobility. This raises the issue of initial and continuing professional development for teachers.  \r\nIn order to promote successful learner mobility and for greater progress in the adoptation of ECVET across Europe, we have to address also VET teachers professional development needs.  It is being increasingly recognized that teachers are an important key to unlocking the potential of ECVET and they need special competences to support learners mobility.  A special attention will be paid to the learners with educational difficulties to support inclusive education in VET programs and in VET teacher education. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is to make students and teachers better equipped to work in international environments both at home and abroad.  The project partners (University of Tartu (EE), Tartu Vocational Education Centre (EE), University of Applied Sciences in Jyvaskyla (FI), Vocational College Lappia, Tornio (FI), West Nottinghamshire College (UK), CESIE (IT) and Acta Center (RO) recognize the need to enhance international mobility in VET training programs in their institutions. Considering that context, our understanding is that often the bottleneck of mobility is related with VET institutions` teachers, who have limited experience and readiness to work with international partners.  The Project provides a practical tool  for VET institutions, which supports and encourages international cooperation and staff/student mobility. \r\nThere are two main objectives for the project: \r\nFirst, create functional and sustainable strategic partnership to facilitate the internationalization of VET programs.

Current strategies support students with stress and anxiety  to some extent, but are not always proving to be very effective at improving performance of the students under pressure. \r\n\r\nThe project pinpoints a particular need which is increasing and impacting on the wellbeing of young people. Although it is accepted that for all people exams and assessments can be a stressful experience, a growing number of young people seem ill equipped with the strategies to cope and this can disproportionately affect their outcomes and hence life chances. Our project will focus specifically on giving students, teachers and trainers from participating institutions an opportunity to share their own perceptions on dealing with issues around the pressure and trial new strategies as adopted by partner institutions to help foster resilience and to reduce anxiety. It is hoped that this will aid students to perform better under pressure and get the best possible results from their courses. In addition the project will also develop a range of strategies that will help students to cope better with the transition to higher education and employment. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n\u2022 Identify and implement strategies at the point of enrollment and on programme to build resilience in order to develop a more self-assured student.\r\n\u2022 Engage with students to develop appropriate student centered approaches for dealing with pressure and improving outcomes.\r\n\u2022 Share best practice with fellow professionals to improve the effectiveness of support.\r\n\u2022 Carry out student surveys to measure the impact of the project.\r\n\u2022 Develop a range of strategies to support the transition to higher education and employment.\r\n\r\nNeeds and Target Groups\r\nThe project will focus on the needs of two different groups. Firstly, students with anxiety who are undertaking exam based qualifications and secondly students on exam based qualifications not currently presenting any symptoms of anxiety. This is in recognition that some strategies we aim to introduce will be preventative whilst others will help minimise anxiety levels. While the UK group will focus on those undertaking A Levels and/or Applied General qualifications, the project partners will select groups that undertake appropriate assessments that require students to perform under pressure and deal with any potential anxiety issues to ensure they perform to their full potential. \r\n\r\nTransnationally\r\nVWNC students come from a range of schools with no discernible differences in terms of student resilience to the pressures of exam performance. As there is no hard evidence of work being undertaken in the UK to address this issue, we are therefore currently following what would be best practice in terms of support for these students in the UK and it is not having the type of impact we would expect. This project will be carried out transnationally in order to explore significantly different practices and determine whether strategies practiced in different countries are proving effective in improving performance students. We will be undertaking a proper assessment by both looking at our own practices and comparing them internationally with the aim of developing new approaches that will have the potential to significantly improve the outcomes for students and develop an approach that can be utilised across a range of different institutions in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.wnc.ac.uk", "West Nottinghamshire College of Further Education, Mansfield", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036674_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["5QJ", "RK5", "Mansfield Community Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG18"}
