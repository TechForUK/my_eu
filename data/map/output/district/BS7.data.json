Our desire for this European dimension is part of this approach and fits in perfectly with this ambition. All the students who have completed their studies in Business and Administration in our school have been offered a trip abroad to a major European city at some point. Since 2004, the school has taught European Classes in English and Spanish on a voluntary basis with vocational subjects taught in English. The school has been involved in three European funded projects for nearly ten years : The Comenius, Leonardo and Erasmus Projects. A financial contribution has been granted by the school for each student having a work experience abroad. This 24-month mobility project is intended to students in our vocational school studying Administration, retail or Sales. The target group consists of students who were not allowed to attend  schools that teach academic subjects therefore seeing themselves as failing at school. Only a few of them came here because they wanted to , most of them being here because they have no other choice. The factors that could motivate the students  do not seem to appeal to them. This project will therefore  help  to remotivate them, to highlight their efforts and restore their self-confidence, to bring them back the pleasure of learning and doing their schoolwork regularly but also to make them aware of the European reality in all its diversity and richness and help them realize all the opportunities that Europe can offer. This  group of 8 boys and girls who are in the final year of a 3- year course  will go to Bristol for five weeks from mid-September to late October. Most of them who are 17 to 19 years old, belong to the European class designed to prepare them at school for this experience abroad including extra English lessons and extra lessons of vocational  subjects taught in English every week. In Bristol, they are placed in a host family on their own with no other guest. The mobility starts with a week  of intensive English Language courses organis ed by Acad\u00e9mie Aquitaine,our intermediate partner for five years, Debbie being also the contact person and their tutor during the stay. Practising English and role-plays in working situations help them build  self-confidence before the training period starts the following week. This 4-week internship from late September to the mid-term holiday  is set,  according to the dates of the fifth training period done by all our students in their final year. On their flight to Bristol, the group is accompanied by their English teacher who takes this opportunity to meet the companies and shops\u2019 managers again and remind them of the objectives to reach. At the end of the mobility, two teachers in Sales and Administration visit each workplace to fill in the official Assessment grid together with the student and the tutor and then fly back with them. This project also supports the attainment of training objectives in a  European context where company practices are different. These  assessments are taken into account in the vocational subjects of their final exam. This experience abroad is also tested during an oral exam which helps the beneficiary graduate with the European class option. The Europass portfolio and the Europro certificate are given to the students on a special European evening at the school. Through mobility the beneficiaries can certify the skills acquired and the competences developed such as integration, independence, open-mindedness, communication in a foreign language. We have been able to assess the progress made by the students in:\r\n- the need for mobility as many plan to have other work experiences in Europe\r\n- job and career opportunities on the European market\r\n- their ability to adapt to a new context (personal or professional)\r\n- European citizenship\r\n- diversity of European culture and cultural understanding\r\n- increased self-confidence and a greater maturity\r\n- more educational opportunities at a higher level.\r\nToday our school wants to play an important role in the European projects and disseminates the benefits.

Our work serves a broad range of civil society actors, including marginalised people. Currently our work contributes most directly to three areas: 1. Active citizenship, democracy & participation, 2. Social cohesion, equity and equality, 3. Migration and demographic change.\r\n\r\nWith our focus on education to strengthen civil society and active citizenship, we have found ourselves responding to increasingly prominent refugee and migrant issues. Consequently, for 2017-19 we have identified two key areas of strategic development:\r\n1) Educating for Resilience in Refugee Solidarity Work\r\n2) Transversality and Strategising for Inclusion.\r\n\r\n1) Under the first we want to be better equipped to support adult educators and other organisers and volunteers engaged in refugee solidarity work. We want our own trainers to gain key skills and competences to address new challenges. We also seek to develop our capacity to train others (including educators) in specific topics we have identified as crucial to supporting that work. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we aim for this project to enable staff to acquire skills to work with: burnout; trauma and post-traumatic stress; knowledge and skills from the work of HRDs on security that is transferable; all in support of educators and volunteers working on refugee solidarity.\r\n\r\n2) We recognise that educational work engaging migrants can be greatly enhanced by tools and approaches developed in \u2018Anti-Oppression Pedagogy\u2019. Also, that contributing as adult educators to addressing the many social issues related to refugees and migrants requires strong transversal and civil society cooperation across sectors and movements. Improved strategic thinking and planning is crucial to meet these important challenges. \r\n\r\nTherefore, under the heading of \u2018Transversality and Strategising for Inclusion\u2019, we are planning this project to meet the need to: deepen our understanding of anti-oppression pedagogies and especially more effective ways to help adult educators work with diversity and the challenges of \u2018othering\u2019 as it manifests in themselves and amongst their learners; and deepen our understanding of transversal cooperation within civil society and how that can inform the strategic development of our educational work.\r\nThe project also has aims at the European level, which include: Connecting with organisations and trainers who can support us to meet the above objectives; extending the provision of our educational work and strengthening our connections with networks developing similar work; to share best practice and innovation to increase sectoral capacity.\r\n\r\nDuring 2017 and 2018, 20 members of staff (comprised of a balance of more and less experienced personnel) will attend courses focused on the themes identified in our strategic plan. The learning will be integrated into the work of Transformative Education; shared across the sector; form the basis of developing and delivering new and innovative curricula that will support educators, professionals and volunteers engaged in refugee and migrant solidarity work, as well as refugees and migrants directly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, staff will see: Increased foreign language competence; Increased opportunities to network and forge connections with European educators and organisations; increased inter-cultural experience; increased sharing and learning of best practice; and new and enhanced skills that will improve their professional development and ability to gain and secure paid employment.\r\n\r\n We have chosen the Ulex Project (run by Col\u00b7lectiu Eco-Actiu) as the training provider because it is possibly unique in Europe as a residential educational centre focused on providing high quality training for civil society organisations to support \u2018social movement impact and resilience\u2019.

During 2016 we identified two related areas of strategic development under the headings \u2018Transversality and Strategising for Inclusion\u2019 and \u2018Educating for Resilience in Refugee Solidarity Work\u2019.\r\n\r\nIn part through an Erasmus Plus project that began in 2017 (and comes to an end in August 2018), we took initiatives to better equip educators and other organisers working in that field. This led us identify the additional need to build capacity for migrant led education and an increase in the capacity amongst trainers and educators from a migrant background and ethnic minorities, together with two additional areas of development. \r\n\r\nOn this basis we have identified two further areas of strategic development for 2018-19. These fall under the headings of:\r\n\r\n1) Building Capacity for Migrant and Minority Led Education\r\n2) Applying Innovative Pedagogies in Migrant Education\r\n\r\n1) Under the heading of Building Capacity for Migrant and Minority Led Education , we want to to increase the availability and capacity of trainers from a migrant background and ethnic minorities able to offer leadership development and empowering education to learners from similar backgrounds.\r\n\r\nBuilding leadership from within minority communities has long been recognised as a key step towards social empowerment, integration and self-advocacy. Such leadership is crucial in situations that often render minorities invisible and discriminate against them. Educators themselves can often fulfil leadership roles through supporting, mentoring and nurturing the development of others. Equipped with methodologies which aim to empower learners \u2013 such as popular, participatory, and learner centred educational approaches \u2013 educators can strengthen the process of \u2018transformation from below\u2019, where marginalised people can build confidence and ability to challenge discrimination, assert their rights, and transform social relationships for the better. \r\n\r\nWe aim for this project to enable staff to acquire and improve skills to provide leadership development training to migrant and minority groups; deepen their knowledge of participatory and popular education methods appropriate to these learner groups; increase their competence to engage diverse learners; and to develop greater confidence in their own leadership qualities and embody these as educators.\r\n\r\n2) Under the heading of Applying Innovative Pedagogies in Migrant Education, we want staff to acquire and improve skills to use tools and techniques developed in Nature Connection Education and Mindfulness-based approaches to be applied in educational initiatives to support resilience and wellbeing for migrants, asylum seekers and undocumented people. This will increase staff competence to develop and deliver new curricula that integrate these newly acquired skills.\r\n\r\nTogether the planned activities will result in an increase in the availability of education for migrants, refugees and learners from other minority backgrounds. We hope it will lead to migrant and minority led education that increases leadership capacity within these same groups and communities. Such leadership skills will support these groups to increase their own capacity to advocate for social inclusion and integration, improving the material conditions of their lives and social well-being. We want to support educators from these minority backgrounds themselves to provide examples of embodied leadership and able to transform the conditions that often render minorities invisible and facing discrimination. All in all, this will lead to the empowerment of the social process of \u2018transformation from below\u2019.\r\n\r\nBetween September 2018 and September 2019, we will send 12 staff, themselves from migrant and minority backgrounds, on two tailored course. A further four staff will attend two programmed courses. These mobilities will be designed and delivered by our partner, the Ulex Project, who we have chosen because of a) the proven high quality of their training work, and b) the possibility of working closely with them to tailor these trainings to our specific needs. \r\n\r\nStaff will benefit from increased foreign language competence; opportunities to forge connections with European educators; and enhanced skills that will improve their professional development and ability to gain and secure paid employment.\r\n\r\nAt a European level the project will strengthen networking between organisations and trainers who share commitments to develop empowering educational opportunities that support social inclusion and provision of high quality education to disadvantaged learners.", null, "Transformative Education C.I.C", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA104-046914_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9AH", "CERES INTERNATIONAL ALJEZUR LIMITED", 22657.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises  (02.02.01)", "fts_2016_37909", 2016], ["9AN", "CLEAR CONNECTION UK LTD", 1391.0, "Other management expenditure (26.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_37862", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS7"}
