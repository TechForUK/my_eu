As especially urban climate is heating up worldwide, acclimatised personal transport is getting more and more the norm, as opposed to taking a bicycle to work. Epsilon aims to conceptualize, develop and prototype a new category of vehicle in between the ultra compact (urban) car and present day moped category small covered vehicles or semi-covered scooters. Epsilon underwrites the 'hard' performance targets defined in the call topic and seeks to meet these while ensuring a very competitive level of affordability and safety. Epsilon can achieve this by means of leveraging the substantial amount of previous and parallel (national & EU-funded) R&D of other projects in which epsilon partners participate, combined with the specific skills and expertise of the consortium members. As such it focuses on optimally integrating cutting edge yet available on prototype level components, materials, manufacturing technologies and subsystems into a drivable prototype plus 2 crash tested body structures. The extensive real experimental testing in combination with advanced performance simulations will allow full confidence verification of the performance of the vehicle and also will allow for strong promotion of the accomplished innovation. Epsilon takes very serious care of the fit between vehicle classes as agreed in European and worldwide standards and the characteristics of the vehicle to be developed.

Around 180 million tonnes per year of products are extracted in the EU, with an estimated contribution of \u20ac10 billion to European GDP and offering direct employment to some 42,500 people.  A secure supply of sustainable mineral products is essential to maintaining the European mining, mineral and manufacturing industries.\n\nThe main objective of STOCISM is to enhance the competitiveness of the European industrial minerals industry by developing cleaner, more energy efficient extraction and processing technologies.  STOICISM is an industry-led project with a specific focus on calcined industrial minerals which are presently energy intensive to produce.  Most calcining uses the direct combustion of fossil fuels, contributing to up to 85% of their carbon emissions.\n\nTo meet the overall aim, three key calcined industrial minerals have been identified: diatomaceous earth; perlite and kaolin.  The processes implemented can also then be directly transferable to many other industrial minerals. In global terms, the EU produces one third of the world\u2019s production of perlite, 20% of calcined kaolin and 20% of diatomite.  Key markets for these minerals are beverage filtration, coatings, plastic, rubber, cosmetics, insulation and construction materials. STOICISM will research, develop and demonstrate a range of new innovative technologies along the industrial minerals value chain. This will include developments in extraction, beneficiation, drying, calcining and waste recycling.\n\nSTOICISM is expected to impact significantly on the sustainability of the EU\u2019s industrial minerals industry by decreasing the use of natural resources (both mineral deposits and energy resources) leading to the sustainable production of better and purer products with less waste and lower environmental impact.", 45109.0, 6859720.0, "STOICISM", null, null, null, "http://www.stoicism.eu/", null, null, "fp7_106426_952902393"], ["3JR", "Design of Electric LIght Vans for Environment-impact Reduction", "Lec 2 Limited", "CO2 emissions, noise emissions and other negative impacts caused by present urban delivery concepts and specifically by the delivery vehicles are unsustainable in present and future European urban life.

The possibility to integrate the electric motor into the wheel further increases the design freedom, especially if also suspension and regenerative braking can be integrated into it. This opens up new freedom in design and clears the way for new urban delivery vehicle concepts. DELIVER is to produce and physically showcase design research results that allow for full exploitation of this new freedom, while responding to changing future market demands.\n\nTo achieve this key objective, the project generates, investigates and analyzes innovative design concepts for electric LDVs with motorized wheels. It delivers a range of advanced architectures which enable at least the same high level of intrinsic safety as known from current best in class conventional vehicles at minimal weight, maximised energy efficiency (40 % better than best-in-class ICE benchmark), optimized ergonomics & loading space at affordable costs as well as acceptable levels of comfort and driving performance.\n\nThe program will culminate in a driving concept validation vehicle which will embody the optimum integration of systems as researched during the design and development stage.

Following pre-selection of three design concepts based on 2020 technologies and beyond, the team evaluated key performance indicators to choose one concept for further development. \n\nAll vehicle dimensions were specified and used to determine geometries and sizes of components and systems.

The internships are an integral part of the education.  Internships abroad require financial support in order to give as many students as possible this opportunity.The students work in a broad spectrum of companies, from planning agencies, design companies, and forestry schools, to gardens for vegetables and flowers.  They thereby not only test the knowledge they amassed while at school, but they also learn the first steps in beginning a career, which may not be widespread in Austria, such as specialized perennial nurseries, planning agencies, that also execute plans, nursery facilities, etc.  By working abroad in a country with a foreign language, the students can deepen their understanding of the English language.  This should also awaken an interest to think outside the national border, when the students choose a future place of work or study.  In the first phase of the project, a total of 20 students will be placed in 6 European countries:  8 in Great Britain, two in Ireland, two in Italy, two in Sweden, one in Portugal and 6 in Germany.  12 students specialize in the market gardening program, while the other 8 focus on garden and landscape design.  That is more than half of the entire student population in that class year.In the second phase of the project, we expect an even larger number of students, because the internship program can be promoted right from the beginning.With our advice and support, the students look for internships themselves.  We provide the students with the appropriate information and insurance.  All the participants can contact us, the advisors, at any time via email or cellphone.  The interns are required to keep a journal for the duration of their internship.  This is necessary for the positive completion of the internship.The internships can be considered a success if the students integrate their work abroad into their plans for the future as a matter of course.In the long-term, we are working on building an informal network of companies and institutions, which will share our commitment to the internship education of the students and offer young people the chance to broaden their horizons.", "http://www.plant-world-seeds.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016488_3"], ["2AQ", "EUBET", "Mare & Foal Sanctuary", 432411.0, "Bromangymnasiet in Hudiksvall is situated in a region of very high unemployment, among the young it is the highest percentage in the country (25 %).

We believe that the courses designed to answer to our needs of professional development will give us necessary tools to change and improve our teaching methods.
