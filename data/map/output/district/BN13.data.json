Populism in Europe and beyond and the rise of extremist parties in many European countries is not helping this debate where xenophobia and far of the \u2018other\u2019 is increasing. A better understanding of other cultures and more initiatives to foster intercultural education become now more relevant than before.\u00a0\r\n\r\nSigns goes North will create an innovative model in promoting cultural diversity and social inclusion. It will use visual representations (photography of city signs, videos of everyday life) and story telling to introduce refugees and newly arrived migrants to the city\u2019s local languages and cultures and in parallel to introduce the city\u2019s local population to the language and culture of the refugees and migrants.Photos of local landmarks (eg. a square or monument), everyday amenities (eg. shops, bank, post office) and natural and urban landscape (eg. parks, lakes/seaside, houses, squares) will be used to promote the and teach the language and culture of the host country to the newcomers to the city, while digital storytelling will be used to promote an understanding of the language and culture of refugees and migrants. Workshops bringing together migrants and locals to tell each other\u2019s stories will foster interaction and enhance better understanding of each other\u2019s cultures.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe project has also a strong focus to represent the city\u2019s several cultures and to identify and promote multiculturalism. This will help locals have a better understanding of diversity and demonstrate openness to newcomers to the city while it will also help newcomers\u2019 orientation and ultimately integration to the local language and culture. The project fosters true promotion of diversity as it will focus equally on a cultural dialogue between the languages and cultures of the four host countries represented in the project (Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands) and the languages and cultures of the refugees and migrants that visit them (eg. Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Kosovo, etc). This will help ultimately with combating discrimination and racism. Better understanding and an open cultural of cooperation and co-production will eventually support the fight against bullying and violence.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn this context, the main goals of the project are to:\r\n\u2022  provide refugees and newly arrived migrants with the means (language, information and tips) to communicate with others beyond one\u2019s own group, to move about independently, or recognise signs, thus helping them to adapt to a place of arrival easily, efficiently and effectively;\r\n\u2022 develop a learning model in a wider sense, fostering respect and understanding for diversity, intercultural competencies and values\r\n\u2022 provide effectively model for the inclusion of newcomers at the municipal level;\r\n\u2022  provide creative mutual learning experience for newcomers and natives;\r\n\u2022  help natives to achieve a better understanding of the world and other groups of people;\r\n\u2022  help refugees socialise and express themselves;\r\n\u2022  remove barriers to integration and promote equality of opportunity\r\n  provide safe and open spaces of interaction between the host and the migrant communities\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the successful methodology of two projects, considered as good practices and awarded at European level - Signs in the City (European Language Labeled project, 2005-2007, awarded best practice of Socrates: Lingua programme) and Beyond Signs in the City (2008-2010, KA2: Languages, awarded best language practice of Lifelong Learning programme). \r\n\r\nSigns goes North innovation and activities focus on:\r\n- A practical learning model \u201cFeel the city - share the feeling\u201d: newly arrived migrants, refugees and locals will work together locally for defining specific needs, selecting places of interest and linguistic and cultural themes in their cities, and will co-produce content and materials. The model allows the newcomers to understand the local culture better and to obtain skills in team work with locals; on the other hand, the original population will understand who the refugees are, and how to include them in mutual activities.\r\n- A mentoring and peer support strategy: key experts with experience in Signs methodology and specialists in creative production will support the local groups at place during the implementation process - photography, video shooting, selection of linguistic and cultural materials, and establishing contacts with local authorities as an integral part of the project impact.\r\n- Digital art/photography and digital storytelling and educational content to develop the City and Language books and the Digital Stories of cities and migrants.\u00a0\r\n- Use of sketch noting through the means of art therapy to empower newcomers  to communicate and be able to tell their story to the locals and exchange cultural understanding of each other\u2019s cultural and linguistic spaces.", "http://www.photeria.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA204-034606_4"]]}}}}
