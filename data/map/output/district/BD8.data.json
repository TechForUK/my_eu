The number of students has increased by one third over the last decade\r\nA survey of parents has shown a high level of satisfaction with the work done by the Teaching Staff (4.6 on a scale of 0 to 5), however, student motivation was lower at 3.35 which is why we will concentrate on improving that over the next 2 years. We will do this by ...\r\n- increasing the student\u2019s motivation\r\n- methodological training for teachers\r\n- increasing the number of Teachers and Students who speak a foreign language\r\nStudents typically enter the lower primary classes full of drive and an eagerness to learn but this tapers off during their years at school until, finally, it reaches low levels in the last years. Having a low level of motivation makes successful learning more difficult to achieve. The question is \u2019what can we, as Teachers, do to maintain and increase the students motivation.\u2019\r\nOur aims: \r\n- increasing our students\u2019 learning efficiency through working with gifted students, training Students to develop and manage  \r\n  effective, individual study schedules. Improving their levels of retentive memory and concentration will help them to do this.\r\n- widening the methodology knowledge of staff as part of a programme of professional improvement\r\n- development of digital competency\r\n- encouraging competitions and connection with sport clubs \r\n- strengthening and widening international relationships\r\n- intensifying co-operation between the staff members\r\n\r\nStaff members contribute to expanding the Schools methodology knowledge by their job-shadowing activities which gives them insight into the methods used to motivate students in other educational establishments. Altogether 11 teachers, 6 from the lower primary, 4 from the higher primary and one from the management team will take part in this project. 6 of them will visit schools in 3 countries (the UK, Finland and Germany) following nearly a year of preparation spent getting to know these countries\u2019 educational systems and effective motivation techniques; 3 teachers will take part in different vocational trainings and 2 will improve their English language knowledge in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe planned effects of the project:\r\n- strong working relationship between the members of the project team\r\n- improved working methods by increased methodological knowledge\r\n- increasing the number of Teachers who read/speak/obtain knowledge through researching reference materials\r\n- improving our working methods through increased methodological knowledge\r\n- translating the knowledge we gain into an effective part of our own pedagogical programme\r\n- our colleagues will strengthen professionally and mentally as well as developing increased energy reserves  as the work load in a \r\n   project of this nature is demanding.\r\n- as the initial project progresses additional project elements will be generated", "http://www.oneinamillion.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA101-047309_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8BD", "Bradford Central \u2013 Getting it Going Stage 2 CLLD", "City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (CBMDC)", "Joint-funded with ESF, the project is the delivery of the Community Led Local Development (CLLD) Strategy for the Bradford Central area in Leeds City Region.
