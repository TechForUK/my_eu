An integrated tool environment will provide support for construction, verification and simulation of models. The delivered methods and tools will overcome significant deficiencies in current practices in cyber-physical systems engineering that make verification and validation hugely costly and time consuming.<br/>The ADVANCE consortium consists of six strong and complementary partners representing a combination of leading European industrial players in systems engineering along with academic partners with internationally leading expertise in formal verification and simulation tools. Systerel and the Univs. of D\u00fcsseldorf and Southampton will lead the development of novel methods and tools while Alstom and Critical Software will apply these to the engineering of intelligent transport and energy systems.

One of the major problems of vibration is that it causes wear and tear which in many instances can lead to equipment or structural failure. To prevent such occurrences, it is essential to not only monitor vibration levels but also to try and understand the underlying causes. This knowledge can subsequently be used to perform active vibration control which in turn improves the overall system's performance, efficiency, lifetime and safety.WiBRATE explores new paradigms for developing innovative strategies for wirelessly monitoring and controlling vibration using a network of intelligent embedded devices that power themselves using harvested vibration energy. The project contributes directly to strengthening the European market in several key sectors such as quality control systems, safety systems, wireless communication and industrial automation and control systems.WiBRATE's key innovation lies in the development of a self-powered, vibration monitoring and control platform. Unlike existing vibration monitoring devices available in the market that operate as individual entities, WiBRATE's unique approach is based on individual intelligent sensor-actuator nodes that communicate wirelessly to collaboratively predict impending failures, perform fault diagnosis or provide real-time feedback. The use of robust wireless communication strategies ensures that the system is highly flexible and allows for a new class of monitoring and control applications that are not possible using traditional wired systems.The WiBRATE project will provide a complete end-to-end solution for carrying out fully automated condition-based maintenance for high vibration environments, thus totally eliminating the labour-intensive process of periodic monitoring. In addition, WiBRATE's continuous monitoring system will also provide proactive maintenance capability. Safety will be increased, since failures can be detected earlier and accidents possibly avoided. The technologies developed in WiBRATE will be demonstrated through multiple case studies in diverse domains such as automotive manufacturing, aerospace and the railway industry.The project consortium includes major industrial players who are world leaders in various aspects of vibration monitoring such as Fiat Research, Honeywell Research and LMS International. This will help to enable rapid commercialisation of the technologies developed in the project.

Its roots date back to the year 1668, when Friedrich Jacob Merck bought the later Engel Pharmacy in Darmstadt. Heinrich Emanuel Merck, who took over the pharmacy in the year 1816 and initiated the start of industrial production, made the first step from a pharmacy to a global company. Today, Merck is a globally active pharma-ceutical and chemical company and employs around 50000 employees in 66 countries. Merck oper-ates in the sectors Healthcare (drugs), Life Science (laboratory materials for research and biotech production) and performance materials (liquid crystals and effect pigments).\r\nDue to the global orientation of our company, it becomes increasingly important to attract multifac-eted and flexible employees who perform their different tasks with high commitment and great motivation. Since 2002, Merck has been involved in training and successfully offers foreign assign-ments for trainees. \r\nAs part of their training, the trainees usually participate in three-month internships in other Euro-pean countries. Trainees from different occupational groups (chemics, physics and biology labora-tory assistants as well as industrial management and office management assistants) are sent to England, Sweden, Austria, Finland, Poland and the Netherlands. During the time abroad, the train-ees work on their own defined projects or support the local employees in their daily work. They can be assigned to subsidiaries and universities. In our experience, the trainees return as mature per-sonalities - they are more self-confident, aware of their strengths, they show their own initiative and assume responsibility. Intercultural awareness and language skills are strengthened. In addi-tion, the trainees also provide additional technical knowledge and competencies.\r\nIn order to ensure the success of the project, the trainees are intensively prepared and there is a close exchange with the participating institutions. During the entire period, the trainees have a permanent contact person with many years of experience.\r\nThe focus of the project is on the trainees. But also the possibility of sending educational staff is used in the form of job shadowing, which is intended to address learning by others.\r\nThe project is very successful and a benefit for all parties involved. Due to the long experience, the program has gained more and more external effect, which is also noted in the application inter-views. Foreign assignments have become an important component of our training at Merck. This is manifested in the continuously increasing numbers of foreign assignments.
