Each group is composed of 15 pupils, aged from 16 to 17. Most of them have already experienced school failure, while learning a work they discover the pleasure to learn. The training we offer helps the pupils to be more confident in themselves and in their ability to succeed. The project will help them to understand that their skills can be recognized outside of school and can help them to find jobs all around the world. The pupils activities will mainly be oriented toward cooking --heart of their future job. They will take cooking classes and will be trained by our partners' teachers.

It is more necessary than ever in this context the workers in the field of youth, especially those involved in youth and economically disadvantaged contexts.Non-formal education is really a tool to improve the self-esteem of young people, and acts as a mechanism of transmission of values, promoting social commitment, solidarity and participation in public space. Non-formal education then it is like a door to new alternative opportunities, and enabling young people to acquire a range of skills that maximize their skills. Due to lack of resources on which these professionals face their daily work, we need to create a network that brings together the sum of knowledge and experience we can offer the institutions and experts working in the field of non-formal education with young people. We are before an opportunity to redefine the role of young people in our society, considering them active agents in our community, and offering a space that guarantees equal opportunities. We believe that the project can create for organizations working in the youth field may have the material and tools necessary for creating a more just society.The main activity in MOVING FORWARD STEP BY STEP is a 3 day CONTACT SEMINAR with the following objectives:1) Know the entities that form part of the project to create in 2016 a strategic partnership aimed at training workers in the field of youth.2) Identify the needs of young people they work with the agencies involved in this project from the point of view of skills and competencies that enhance teamwork, creativity, long-term planning, commitment, high aspirations and positive attitude.3) Determine the objectives, activities and role of each partner, intellectuals results and multiplier effects.The project is aimed at workers in the field of youth and young people and involves 4 European entities: Montblanc Foundation (Spain), Havco Haringey (UK), Ateneum (Sweden) and The Rosetta Foundation (Ireland).

Italy is the European country with the largest number of spas thanks to its unique geology volcanic phenomena. In fact the spa and wellness tourism in Italy host  4.2% of tourists in hotels or other types of accommodation, that  means 15 million people every year. If we analyze the human capital skill in the sector, we understand that the demand for the professions, as  restaurant and bar service but also staff in marketing and fitness, increased. These companies need to be equipped by the staff with different level of skill and competences to be able to meet  the challenges presented by the market and to take advantage of  the opportunities to grow . The project TE.BE.  intends to respond to this need, by offering  an opportunity to the students and graduates of  Lazio, Tuscany, Lombardy, Puglia, Veneto and Piedmont  region to obtain an educational and professional experience in foreign companies that operate in the tourism sector of  spa and wellness in the following areas :- Tourist services: specific skill  in restaurant, bar, kitchen and technical services for accommodation;- Marketing and communication:  tourism marketing  and communication skill - Health and fitness:   spa and wellness skill;- Management and administration: management and administration skill .OBJECTIVES.  The participants involved will be able to carry out a training and professionalizing experience in international environments, which will enable them to equip themselves with a mix of interdisciplinary and interconnected skill.

In the long term, we expect: greater involvement of Italian partners (institutional or non), the extension of the partnership abroad, from territorial and skill point of view; the possibility to carry out exchange projects and cooperation also thanks to the participation in other European programs (as COSME and other instruments that finance the social and wellness tourism etc.); the opportunity to become (as the Consortium) a prestigious partner in mobility management and the adoption of the logic EQAVET  nd of the system of recognition of the credits ECVET.", "http://www.londonplacementacademy.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005267_13"], ["5RF", "Les papilles trotteuses en Europe", "The University of West London", 77208.0, "This Project is part of our establishment objective to open a European section in English in a first step and a section in Spanish in a second.Our project aims to enhance vocational trainings that are usually poorly considered in offering an added value thanks to an international openess. At a time when finding a job can be a great challenge for many people, international mobility can offer more opportunity and be definitively a plus.Improving skills in foreign languages has evolved and it now also includes intercultural management. Feeling of European citizenship has considerably increased. Being aware of other cultures, learning or improving skills in foreign languages is definitively part of students or professional mobility. Students\u2019mobility participates in building European citizenship.International mobility can't be played down it is particularly interesting in terms of communication with people from other cultures.It is acculturation that is an essential aspect that can allow our learners to adapt to foreign countries at a faster pace, beyond language learning. This opening on other countries should be part of the curriculum alongside with the experience of travelling. We consider it is essential to offer our learners to live an enriching experience abroad and to improve professional and personal skills that would be a springboard for their future.Pupils concerned are undergoing the second year of a BTEC National (STHR), there are 21 pupils and the second year of a GNVQ Advanced (baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel) in cooking, there are 10 in this class. We do not know the precise number of pupils for each class for next year. The pupils are aged from 16 to 18.Most of them have already experienced school failure, while learning a work they discover the pleasure to learn. The training we offer to help the pupils to be more confident in themselves and in their ability to succeed. The project will help them to understand that their skills can be recognized outside of school and can help them find jobs all around the world. TThe pupils activity will mainly be oriented toward cooking --heart of their future job. Pupils in STHR will follow cooking and service courses. These classes will allow them to discover new cooking techniques, new food and ingredients while improving their language skills.To succeed, this project will be based on the steering committee that defines the actions to take, schedules actions and actors. It participates in setting up the actions with the help of the stakeholders of the project. The project is conducted with experienced partners in European programs managing. A charter of mobility will be signed up by all stakeholders. It will define our expectations regarding learning process and interpersonal skills of our pupils. This project will involve the pupils' family and everyone role and responsibility will be stated. Formative assessment will be planned to check that the objectives targeted are reached --before, during and after the project. These evaluations will be based on three major skills we want to improve for our pupils: language skills, know-how and interpersonal skills.The project will have a strong and immediate impact on interpersonal skills and their ability to accept others differences. Thanks to mobility, our pupils will learn to coexist in a multicultural society. It will also have an impact on their motivation and will reduce absenteeism in giving them an objective : being part of the project. As a consequence it will also impact other pupils, who haven't been part of the project yet but will arouse enthusiasm to be part of a project too while listening to their mates\u2019 experience.This project will also impact our pedagogical team and will offer them a new dynamic for their teaching techniques and for their future projects.On a long-term basis, we wish that such projects will be part of our pupils\u2019 scholarship, and that each of them can get the chance to travel abroad. Such projects will allow our pupils to differentiate and to make the difference when they will hunt for a job. Professional mobility is definitely a major asset. Our pupils will be opened to the world, with actual personal and communicating skills, being more adaptable.Cooking is an almost universal language.

In this perspective, the project EMOTION aims as objectives:\r\nO1- Increase the quality of teaching and learning by improving the skills of management and leadership of training  for a total number of 7 VET teachers participating in activities of shadowing type in Granada, during 7 days\r\nO2 - Improvement of the quality of professional training of 64 students (in 4 streams) from the fields of qualification Commerce/Trading and Tourism, participants in practice training sessions of 14 days, at economic agents  in the UK - London, between 2017-2019, in order to facilitate insertion on the labor market for future graduates\r\nO3 \u2013 Increase the capacity of a total number of 80 teachers and 1200 students from VET to trigger changes at the school level, in terms of modernization and international openness by strengthening the European dimension of the educational and professional training process, until 2020.\r\nThe project addresses to students and teachers in VET: 7 teachers will participate in direct observation by job shadowing, of the way the management and leadership of training is approached in an innovative manner, in a prestigious school in Granada, and will benefit of transfer of good practices and advice in this field; 64 students of XI th grades will participate in practical training sessions in four streams-placement  at economic agents in the UK, to improve professional skills, during two years, as follows: Stream 1 - Feb. 2018 practical training (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers. Stream 2 \u2013 April 2018 (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers; Stream 3 February 2019 (9 pupils, Commerce + 7 pupils - Hotel) and 2 accompanying teachers; Stream 4 - April. 2019 (7 pupils, Commerce + 9 students - Hotel) and two accompanying teachers. Economic operators: Sona Tours, Airworld Tours, Ariana Business Centre Travel, Almont Travel, The Ultimate Travel, Berjaya Eden Park Hotel, Holiday Inn Elstree, Hotel 55, Cleveland Hotel\r\n Expected results: seven teachers from VET will develop their pedagogical skills through comparisons between the system and methods of education in the partner countries and the promotion of learning based on active-participative methods and techniques, (this can contribute to professional development and the assumption of new duties and responsibilities within the institution). Development of the competences of management and leadership of training. On medium term - they will develop skills and abilities of communicating in English, will become more active European citizens and will develop their management and leadership skills and will involve themselves in teams to access new European funds to maintain the results.\r\n64 pupils will develop their skills and competences in the fields of commerce/trade, tourism and hotel, attractive on the European labor market, will achieve expected results in the examinations for certification of professional skills, will develop their social skills - optimizing skills of cooperation, work in networking, assuming roles in the team but also personal autonomy and self-efficacy - increasing self-confidence and motivation to perform, to learn how to think critically and independently, increasing the desire to learn autonomously. On medium term it will be improved the process of transition from education and training to the labor market; the increase of the degree of insertion on the labor market and the acquired language skills can help them to efficiently insert themselves on the European labor market, increasing their chances of acquiring a well-paid job that offers opportunities for personal and professional development. On long-term the development of the sense of tolerance and respect for other cultures will help to strengthen European identity and create a society with respect for deeply human values, universally valid.", "http://www.hotel55-london.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-RO01-KA102-036584_9"], ["5RF", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "The University of West London", 46967.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

Besides becoming familiar with standard business procedures as well as company structures and enabling them to use their knowledge and improve their skills acquired during their course, a work placement abroad offers them an insight into everyday working atmosphere and living conditions in other European countries. For young people interested in the European integration process and training for a career in an international environment a stay abroad is a prerequisite for a successful start into professional life.\r\n\r\nThe following intentions and objectives have been worked out together with companies that offer our students the opportunity to pass a work placement abroad: \r\nto obtain an insight into in-company procedures by using the country's language; to experience the single European market and realize special strategies of discovering the German market from the foreign company's point of view; to experience the basic ties and differences between cultures, to learn to develop sympathy for culture, life and mentality of the host country, thus reacting reasonably in the foreign language and if necessary being able to reply critically to prejudices; to obtain knowledge about socio-economic and political relations and problems of the host country in order to deal with national characteristics in everyday situations. \r\n\r\nOur students are offered work placements in various European countries; they choose a host country according to their personal expectations based on their skills and command of the foreign language to be improved substantially with the help of this project.

This is why, VET-Engine organise a 4-weeks vocational training abroad. The participants can do internships in the UK, Spain and Italy. Participants are 35 trainees aged between 18 and 30 who are in their second year of training (or later) or are new graduates. The project is interdisciplinary in nature and is aimed particularly at trainees in the chemical and manufacturing industries.

Industrial and chemistry is a key pillar in the profile of Central Germany, and many large international companies have set up facilities in the region\u2019s traditional centres of chemical production to take advantage of local expertise. Acquiring soft skills and international experience during an internship abroad creates a win-win situation; it increases the job perspectives of participants at the same time as making a motivated and more internationally skilled workforce available for local employers. In most cases, the participants return from abroad much more motivated and self-confident. This increases the attachment of future staff to the company. The trainees will gain their first experience abroad and thereby to contribute to improving their foreign language abilities (especially English) and soft skills. At the same time, they can extend on their job-related skills thanks to the 4-week internship.

The project aims to improve the situation in education and develop an innovative program of training for professionals working with adults with ASD as well as prepare innovative tools and methods of sharing knowledge among this professionals. The project is planned due to the lack of lifelong learning for adults with ASD in many countries, particularly in post-communist countries. The lack of adequate training of functioning in the society excludes these people from social and professional life. The lack of education programs for adults with ASD is directly connected with to the absence of training programs preparing professionals to work with adults with ASD in high education curriculums. During the project all 3 organizations, based on their comprehensive expertise, will collect data and information about good practices in education programs of adults with ASD and education programs of professionals  working with this group of people with disabilities. The next step organizers will develop three programs dedicated for professionals:1. First Step Programme: the basic training program for professionals to work/ cooperate with adults with ASD (2 x 2 days of workshops);2. Step Two Programme: the advanced program of training for professionals working/ cooperating with people with high-functioning autism (HfA). Program focused on self-reliance and social and work competences.3. Ste Three Programme: the advanced program of training for professionals working/ cooperating with people with low-functioning autism (LfA). Program focused on attain of general competences needed at work and increase of self-reliance.In order to choose optimal version of Programmes there will be testing phase in each country involved in the project. The main goal of the training for professional staff working with adults with ASD is to receive their opinions about the methodology, quality of tools and potential revision corresponding to the participants needs. It is crucial for implementers that training programs should prepare people with ASD to social inclusion as well as implementation and realization of their right according to Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
