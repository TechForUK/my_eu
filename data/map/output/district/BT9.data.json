Explore our cultures, values & habits and to discuss these with each other, to explore new values and attitudes, to explore our personal boundaries and gross them.  Together, we will look into the European maritime history of the nationalities involved: having a look at the differences, but just as much at the similarities in the development of our countries. History and seafaring has always had a huge impact on the view of each culture on society, but the modern online communication has enabled the continuous exchange of ideas from one side of Europe to another. We will also discuss current developments in Europe & the world, and our personal role in sustaining the freedom we have, and creating it for others. \r\n\r\nParticipants come from five different European countries. Each country has its own culture, resulting in questions to be discussed by the participants; 'Do our differences impede us to work together? Are we actually that different? Can we actively apply the differences and similarities between us, to work better as a team?' It is not our goal to find an agreement, but to make participants listen to and respect each other. \r\n\r\nThe exchange program activities combine sailing a Tall Ship with discussions, presentations, games etc. It is the combination of the methods of the activities that make the program so effective. We will not only talk about cultural differences but also experience them in a reallife task. All teh activities enhence the cultural learning, the realisation how special Europe is and how privilaged we are to live in a free democracy. \r\n\r\nLearning to sail the vessel sis done with a special program, which requires participants to confront many demanding challenges, both physical and emotional. It inspires self-confidence and the acceptance of personal responsibility. It promotes an acceptance of others, whatever their social or cultural backgrounds, and develops a willingness to take controlled risks. Sail training includes instruction in all aspects of sailing but its purpose goes far, far beyond this. Sail training uses the experience of being at sea principally as a means to help people learn about themselves, discover hidden strengths and talents and understand the value of working as a team.  Both the crew and the mentors are experienced with the Sail Training Program.\r\n\r\nWorking and living together with people from other countries, will make participants casually learn about other cultures. Spending time together in such a small area as a ship is, makes it easy to observe and learn from eachothers habits. Also, in the day-to-day program several country presentations will be included to teach eachother specific things about their countries, cultures, and languages.\r\n\r\nBoth by planned discussions as mentioned in the day-to-day program, and the probable discussions resulting from differences in daily habits, participants will learn to see things from various perspectives and be more tolerant about the differences among them.\r\nThus, participants will improve their team working skills and be more aware of their abilities, strengths and weaknesses, both physically, mentally and linguistic. This will increase their self-confidence, and also improve their social skills. As they will do all this in a culturally divers environment, their awareness for cultural differences and similarities will grow, as well as their understanding for differences in values and norms. develop their teamwork & leadership skills and learn how to deal with challenges, whether they are physical, practical, or caused by cultural differences\r\n\r\nThe Impact of the programs, goes beond the participants. The changed attitudes and grown self confidence will also influence the friends, classmates, families, their whole network. We think the experiential side of our program is the key to the intense learning effect of the program.

Modules will be designed (also using ECVET criteria) to help teachers to develop in their students an EU enviromental-friendly way of thinking and a proactive attitude to be part of a process aimed at making successful the road toward a resource efficient Europe. One of the most innovative aspect is the strong interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral character of the project, because it can extend to the VET system the synergy between training, scientific research and enterprises promoted by the EU through HORIZON 2020 and LIFE programmes.EN-VET will be composed of 5 Ios devoted to get innovative didactical products who originate the proposal and 3 process activities devoted to a correct management of the project (management, quality, dissemination). The tasks of the different IOs will be achieved through various intermediate steps, but the final results, that will be available for free to all the interested users through the project website and the book, will be 5:1) a comparative Report;2) at least 3 introductory didactical modules;3) at least 5 advanced didactical modules dealing with specific case studies;4) a testing report with the appreciation of the products;5) the document on guidelines.These products will be done by the partners\u2019 experts and thanks to the stakeholders from productive and social systems and the trainers/teachers/managers of the VET system involved in planning, testing and validating the products.At the end of the project another O5 product will be the book (offered also on line) who will collect all the project results.The management of the whole Project will be performed by the Coordinator, assisted by a Project Board. They will harmonize and integrate the foreseen actions, tasks and deliverables, also thanks to an efficient communication towards 4 groups (partners of the project, ndirect and direct target groups, stakeholders and beneficiaries involved in the project activities and the Program Authority.)

Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries. The number of adults is increasing significantly and the forecast is that the number of adults with CF will increase by 100% between 2010 and 2025. These individuals will mostly have chronic infection with Pa. \n\nIndividuals with BE have chronic cough and sputum production and frequent respiratory infections which lead to impaired lung function and health-related quality of life. Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. New antibiotics with activity against such respiratory pathogens are urgently needed.  \n\nThe iABC-consortium (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic fibrosis) brings together world leading collaborative researchers to develop new antibiotic treatment options for people with CF and BE by sharing expertise and resources. It involves about 20 public partners and 2 pharmaceutical companies in 6 countries and 4 pan-European networks: ECFS-CTN, CLIN-Net, LAB-Net and EMBARC. These networks inclide almost all European countries and will be used to recruit centres for the clinical trials.

To achieve this goal first a mapping exercise of existing networks and elements needed for such networking has to be done.

RATIONALE: Inflammation is central to the development of BPD. Corticosteroids (CS) have antiinflammatory properties and early inhalation of CS may allow for beneficial local effects on the pulmonary system with a lower risk of undesirable systemic side effects.  STUDY DESIGN: Randomised placebo-controlled, multi-centre clinical trial and genetic/pharmacogenetic substudy.
