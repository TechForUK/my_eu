There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.

The second objective is to examine the effect of evolutionary divergence on HGT, by determining whether genes from closely related species are more permissive to transfer than those from more divergent species. The final objective is to determine the role of the environment in shaping these selective effects. Understanding how robust the selective effects are to different environmental conditions will aid in evaluating the relative roles of genetics and the environment as factors in the evolutionary outcomes of HGT .

The aim of the present project is to solve this problem by developing and testing a new unified cross-linguistic account of the development of sentence structure.

The highly dynamic and complex digital objects that result from such an environment mean that human appraisal is increasingly infeasible. Automated or computer-assisted mechanisms are needed to address the long-term sustainability of this content, dealing not only with technological obsolescence (such as hardware, software, file formats), but also with 'semantic drift' of digital assets (e.g. due to changes in terminology), and with disciplinary and societal changes (socialisation of the data).PERICLES address these challenges by developing extensions to current preservation and lifecycle models that address the evolution of dynamic, heterogeneous resources and their dependencies in changing environments, including policies, processes, semantics, and users, as well as the content itself. Maintaining the complex dependencies between the components of the preservation ecosystem is key to achieving 'preservation by design', through models that capture intents and interpretative contexts, and thus enabling content to remain relevant to changing communities of users.

The epidemiology and clinical features of co-infected subjects are well documented, however, there is a paucity of basic scientific studies addressing the interactions between these pathogens. There is undoubtedly a complex interplay between pathogens and the host immune response.

EU-NCL is designed, organized and operated according to the highest EU regulatory and quality standards in order to provide a full analytical cascade of 42 assays. Within EU-NCL, 6 analytical facilities will offer a Trans National Access to their existing analytical services but they will also develop new or improved analytical assays under the Joint Research Activities in order to keep EU-NCL at the cutting edge of the nanomedicine characterisation. A complementary set of networking activities will make EU-NCL able to deliver to the European academic or industrial scientists the best analytical services they dramatically require for accelerating the industrial development of their candidate nanomedicines.

AKU is a genetic deficiency of homogentisic acid dioxygenase, causing high levels of homogentisic acid (HGA). Oxidation of HGA to pigment polymer, termed ochronosis, alters connective tissues. This leads to multisystemic damage dominated by premature severe arthritis. Currently, multiple arthroplasty is inevitable since AKU is incurable and there is no effective palliative therapy. No data exists regarding the presence or absence of ochronosis before age 30 years. Hence, it is unknown whether treatment is necessary before then. A potential HGA-lowering therapy with nitisinone is available, but lacks outcome data. Thanks to our existing successful fundamental and clinical research (cell models, animal models, natural history studies), we are now ready for the final stage of clinical development of nitisinone for AKU in order to overcome these challenges. This will involve a dose finding study, a phase 3 clinical trial to prove efficacy, and a cross-sectional study in children and young adults to determine when to start treatment.

Both HEIs and SMEs are encouraged by policies to jointly generate new knowledge and innovations. HEIs in Europe are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, where they need to cater to diverse stakeholders. In addition, research evaluation considers the impact of university research outside academia. Thus, the HEIs are expected to develop more cooperative links with the business community. At the same time, SMEs need to improve their skills and knowledge, considering their limited resources, so that they can develop their innovation capabilities and improve their competitiveness against bigger players. HEIs tend to seek for links with rather large businesses for reasons of prestige and to access additional funding for their research and teaching activities. Hence, the links between university departments/research centres and SMEs may have been side-lined although they can be beneficial to both sides. \r\nTo fill this gap, the proposed programme pursues the objective of conceiving a collaborative cloud based platform that implements a new agile methodology to support higher education institutions to collaborate in innovation processes with businesses across Europe in a systematic and organised way. The cloud based platform will support companies to manage and implement the complex innovation processes by taking advantage of universities' research and technological knowledge and expertise in a systematic way, by enabling an open multi-agent focused innovation (i.e. HEI/business focused innovation). The term university here means the universities and their associated/local colleges and schools. In any case, vocational colleges are key actors in this proposed project.
