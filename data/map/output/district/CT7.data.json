Aventus is ready for this and by participating in European Profiles Aventus\u2019 students who distinguish themselves by making the choice of having a traineeship with one of Aventus\u2019 European partners will benefit from this new step by Aventus. The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.  The student mobility will be organized in the regions of the EUROPRO partners on the basis of intensive cooperation with Aventus in the fields of preparation, matching, execution, assessment, evaluation and dissemination of international traineeships with ECVET components from 1 July 2014 till 30 June 2016.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000030_5"], ["9NY", "European Professionalization Networks", "Safer to be Seen", 95360.0, "The last 10 years Aventus invested much into knowledge exchange with European partners.

Moreover during the last 3 years getting acquainted with ECVET instruments was high on Aventus\u2019 agenda. Because the translation of work processes into \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment of the achievements during work placements with training companies in Europe. For this  reason together with a number of European partners, while utilizing ECVET instruments Aventus made new steps to realize both more transparency of qualifications and a matching assessment system of international work placements. This intensification of the cooperation led to the creation of formal networks, which use \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d as a starting point. The international work placement and staff professionalization are organized around these job profiles within these networks.

As a learning organization Aventus will submit this application both from the perspective of the individual teacher and of the organization.
