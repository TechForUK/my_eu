Each one of the methodologies of each partner has a very unique approach, therefore the dialogue between them is important in terms of share the knowledge, connect adult educators using artistic forms of expression, exchange and reflect learning processes and good practices, and finally contribute to improve quality of their approaches.The main objectives of your project is to exchange of good practices in adult education that use artistic expression methodologies as a tool to connect people to their lived reality toward healthy lifestyle and community well being. In specific methodologies that:- use art methodologies as lifelong learning opportunity- promoting self empowerment, self development, connecteness, open postures- promote holistic healthy lifestyles- approach, value, express and celebrate the unlogical, surreal, non verbal, emotional life contentsIn these project there will be 4 adult educators directly involved with the project , one from each country, that form the T-ART team;16 adult educator benefiting from the training course on the different approaches exchanged and 16 european adult educators financed and 150 adult educator benifiting from a seminar event that will be the project final event where all methodologies are presented, reflected potencializing new projects, network and activities related with this interdisciplinary dialogue and finally 50 locals benefiting from the seminar sharing event.There will be 3 project transnational meetings: the first to present the project, the second to make a midterm evaulation and to prepare the seminar struture and the third to evaluate the project. In terms of activities there will be a website and a Facebook page (A2) on the project. The exchange of methodologies and good practices will be done through a training course (C1) directed by the 4 partners and hosted in one of the Partner country. The partner organizations then will promote the approaches present in the TC through an introducing Workshops on it related in their own organizations. Then it will be organized a seminar event C2 where all 4 methodologies presented, discussed with european adult educators in a perspective of facilitate new projects in adult education around the topic to be born. And finally it will be organized a T-ART celebration event (A3) in each organization with locals to disseminate the results of the project.The methodology used in carrying out the project are: dragon dreaming project design/management; education through artistic expression methodologies; education through art; non formal education; experiential learning; informal semi strutured dialogue; skypeconference; IT (website, FB);The results expected from this exchange of good practices are: to connect adults educator that use artistic forms of expression into lifelong learning perspective; to acquire deep understanding on: the artistic forms of expression methodologies, their impact in their learners, their benefits and their challenges; to find common, different and complementar points in the different methodologies, to improve the quality of their methodologies and their performance as adults educators from the dialogue between them. The impact of this project is the creation of a network of adult educators using artistic forms of expression with very different approaches in adult learning, the openess of horizonts in each partner to what is being developed in europe in this field, and finally in the developement of T-ART into 4 KA1 training courses for adult educators on each of the approaches and a KA2 strategic partnership in innovation project related with artistic forms of expression, lifelong learning, self development and healthy lifestyles. In a long term this project had open doors as an example of the benefits of the exchange of good practices that can inspire other project or practices of adult educators. In terms of content, T-ART open doors to intelectual, methodological and holistic discussions on different approaches around artistic forms of expression that allow this field, the partner organizations and the participants involved to keep developing in this direction. This open door promotes the awareness of the potencial in adult education with artistic methodologies and adult educators performances, under the lifelong learning, experiential learning and non formal education perspectives, as well as the development of adults in terms of their holistic health, quality of life, and the rescue/reconnection with their purpose of life which contributes for the community well being.", "http://www.tamalpa-uk.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PT01-KA204-022919_3"]]}}, "6HQ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1262304000000, 1325289600000, "Early Detection Of CAncer using photonic crystal Lasers", "2m Engineering Limited", "In Europe there are 3 million new cancer cases per year. According to the WHO the burden of cancer can be reduced by systematic and equitable implementation of evidence based strategies for cancer prevention, early detection and management of patients with cancer.  33% of the cancer burden could be reduced if detected early and treated adequately. The WHO concludes that, early diagnosis of cancers could save the developed world an average of \u20ac40 billion per year on medical costs and \u20ac80 billion per year on realized productivity. The direct savings on medical treatment alone would be more than \u20ac10.000 per patient if early detection was possible. Early cancer diagnosis today consists of recognition of some of the \u2018early\u2019 signs by the patient themselves or detection from screenings carried out on specific population groups.    If something suspicious is found the next step is to perform a blood analysis and/or to look with non-invasive imaging techniques. Current imaging techniques are widely used in diagnostic procedures but they cannot give conclusive evidence of  cancer. Today, only a biopsy and the subsequent pathologist\u2019s interpretation can give a definitive diagnosis of cancer  and this is not always enough EDOCAL will use a tunable blue laser to selectively excite an accumulated photo sensitizer, called proto-porphyrin. This sensitizer is taken by the patient to enhance contrast between healthy and cancerous tissue. Reflected light is filtered using state of the art ultra narrow photonic crystal technology. Initial studies have shown that it is possible to detect cancerous tissue using blue light in combination with FDA approved sensitizers (ALA-5 and Proto-Porphyrin).

Current unmet clinical needs can be addressed by optical methods due to the combination of non-invasive and real-time capture of unprecedented biomedical information.\nThe MIB objective is to provide robust, easy-to-use, cost-effective optical methods with superior sensitivity and specificity to enable a step-change in point-of-care diagnostics of bladder cancer. The concept relies on combining optical methods (optical coherence tomography, multi-spectral opto-acoustic tomography, shifted excitation Raman difference spectroscopy, and multiphoton microscopy) providing structural, biochemical and functional information. The hypothesis is that such combination enables in situ diagnosis of bladder cancer with superior sensitivity and specificity due to unprecedented combined anatomic, biochemical and molecular tissue information. The step-change is that this hybrid concept is provided endoscopically for in vivo clinical use.\nThe project relies on development of new light sources, high-speed imaging systems, unique imaging fibre bundles, and endoscopes, combined and applied clinically. The consortium comprises world-leading academic organisations in a strong partnership with innovative SMEs and clinical end-users. \nThrough commercialization of this novel imaging platform, MIB is expected to reinforce leading market positions in medical devices and healthcare for the SMEs in areas where European industry is already strong. The impact is that improved diagnostic procedures facilitate earlier onset of effective treatment, thus recurrence and follow-up procedures would be reduced by 10%, i.e., reducing costs.

It is recommended to do this test at least 4 times a day. Many diabetics fail to do so even once for a number of reasons:  pain avoidance, disliking the sight of blood, cost of the test strips, the test protocol and the risk of infection. This failure to manage blood glucose levels has serious long term implications. Heart disease and blood vessel disease are the biggest complications that people with uncontrolled diabetes face. Blood vessel damage or nerve damage also lead to chronic foot and leg ulcers called diabetic foot that can result in amputations. More than 60% of leg and foot amputations not related to an injury are due to diabetes which is also the cause of new blindness and kidney disease. Our solution is a non-invasive glucose monitor that will allow people with diabetes to monitor their blood glucose levels in a quick and painless manner, for a low price.  \nWhen using normal Raman Spectroscopy very little light undergoes Raman scattering, therefore high integration times are required to achieve a usable signal-to-noise ratio. Expensive optics are necessary for collecting, isolating and dispersing the light. Our technique and system packaging promises to overcome all of these obstacles. \nWe use Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy, created when two light beams interact with each other in the presence of glucose.  The energy is transferred from one beam of light to the other, and this transfer is proportional to the number of glucose molecules present. By measuring this energy transfer using a simple and inexpensive power meter, the glucose concentration is measured without the need for dispersing the light and analyzing the Raman Spectrum.

Almost 90% of its external and over 40% of its internal trade is transported by sea. The natural wealth of the ocean has an intrinsic value for the biodiversity of Europe as well as for the support of key functions for adjacent regions and populations. Oil spills have a catastrophic impact on the marine environment and incurs enormous costs and suffering in the aftermath. A large part of the oil spillage comes from drifting ships running aground or breaking up.   The project idea is to develop a novel and salvage tool by innovatively combining a light-weight sea anchor and connector. The system will be deployed by helicopter onto a ship in distress, thus reducing drift velocity and through that the chance of grounding or other potential disasters by providing extra time for Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs). Further functionality is added by including a towing connection to the sea anchor, thereby providing arriving ETV with an easy-to-access pick-up buoy, which relieves them of the hazardous task of connecting to the ship in distress. A major issue in the project is lowering the weight of the system to enable helicopter transport. This calls for studies in material science and will influence the dimensioning of the anchor, which will be based on simulations of multi-body behaviour at sea under the influence of wind and waves. At the ship and tanker traffic increases there is a reduction in ETV preparedness, leading to a potentially unsafe situation.
