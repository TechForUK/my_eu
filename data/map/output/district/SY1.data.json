Thus, RLW Navigator will crucially serve as an enabler for future energy efficient smart factories. RLW is emerging as a promising joining technology for sheet metal assembly due to benefits on several fronts including reduced processing time, (50-75%) and decreased factory floor footprint (50%), reduced environmental impact through energy use reduction (60%), and providing a flexible process base for future model introduction or product change. Currently, RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to an acute lack of systematic ICT-based simulation methodologies to navigate their efficient application in automotive manufacturing processes. The project aims to address this by developing a Process Navigator simulation system that will deal with three key challenges thereby allowing manufacturers to utilize the advantages of the RLW system.Firstly, the most critical obstacle that currently prevents the successful implementation of RLW is the need for tight dimensional control of part-to-part gap during joining operations, essential to ensure the quality of the stitch.Secondly, the existing assembly system architecture must be reconfigured to provide the opportunity to evaluate the RLW system in terms of its feasibility to perform all required assembly tasks. This will provide crucial information about the most advantageous workstation/cell reconfiguration, which will serve as the basis for optimal robot path planning to reduce joining process time and workstation level efficiency assessment.Finally the project will develop systematic evaluation and learning methods to assess and improve the overall performance, cost-effectiveness and eco-efficiency of the RLW system.", 86510.0, 5416569.0, "RLW Navigator", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100030_966988442"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1RD", "Kokapstr\u0101des ra\u017eo\u0161anas apm\u0101c\u012bbas meto\u017eu pilnveido\u0161ana prak\u0161u vad\u012bt\u0101jiem", "Severnvale Academy Limited", 7710.0, "The timber industry has a special role in the Latvian economy , which has been one of the main drivers of export.

The three-year establishment project is focused on international axes mainly for 2015-2016. Lannion being located within an area with a strong touristic activity, it is of the responsibility of the training establishments to get the necessary means to increase the language attractiveness and exchanges with foreign countries in order to make our students improve their skills. Besides, our establishment is a catering and hospitality vocational school which on the one hand aims at making our students enter the local labour market world- students in a face-to-face relationship with foreign customers, and on the other hand it aims at enabling them to have an access to positions abroad.The project mainly focuses on the professional mobility of the learners from the Technological option (Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel). During eight weeks, the students are immersed into a company and take part in its daily activities. As regards the corporate training, our students have to attend it but this has a more important meaning since it takes place in the United-Kingdom, Spain or Sweden.

With a computer you need to log on and then navigate to the resources, whether this be a link, a resource search or something on your Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) or portal. This is acceptable, but can be a long process and some of the immediacy can be lost in the process. Some learners can become distracted or do something completely different, risking losing attention and concentration. Using augmented reality you can link precisely and directly to resources eliminating these potential problems.\r\n\r\nA mixture of online and blended learning approaches in conjunction with face to face teaching/instruction can provide a greater balance and variety of resources and interactions. This linked with the quality of teaching, mentorship and the overall offender learner experience can only be beneficial to all learners and provide pathway for innovation linked to technology.\r\n\r\nAugmented Reality can provide learners in youth offender learning with a more interactive way of learning, facilitate research, activities, instruction and information. These AR resources can give information on a range of instructional and skills based topics that will be engaging and interesting. A 'trial' project of Augmented Reality will be needed in youth custodial establishments, with security and access a key factor and of major importance. The project will need to ensure that the resources are 'locked' from the outside world and access is monitored and within the security confines required for custodial institutions.\r\n\r\nThe use of mobile devices to access the resources on a designated App gives an increased access to a whole new way of learning at any given time. This will enable these resources to be shared easily with the wider community. It is envisaged that \u2018standalone\u2019 versions of the resources and links to the videos and learning materials will be available within the learning portal or environments at each establishment, creating an individual resource bank, safely and within constraints of security processes.\r\n\r\nThe project aims \r\n\u2022 Evaluate the effectiveness of using Augmented Reality resources for giving access to information, resource and instruction about a range of topics to custodial establishments.\r\n\u2022 Investigate security and access requirements needed to ensure that the resources are 'locked' from the outside world and access is monitored and within the security confines required for custodial institutions.\r\n\u2022 Extend and enhanced the learner information experience using an engaging tool that enables students to use their own smart devices to access the content\r\n\u2022 Develop high quality resources using Augmented Reality as a tool to link to engaging information for learners that can be accessed in a range of situations (AR posters, leaflets, literature disseminated to institutions, etc.)\r\n\u2022 Reach a wider audience as a result of production of the AR resources\r\n\u2022 Share good practice\r\n\u2022 Undertake a review/evaluation of the project with outcomes report\r\n\u2022 Raise attainment in youth offender learning trans-nationally\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the project outputs will enable learners:\r\n-- Opportunity to gain skills & knowledge they wouldn't otherwise easily have access to\r\n- Higher engagement /attendance in lessons in prisons\r\n- Build on prior knowledge\r\n- Better results - improved employability\r\n- Learning outside of lessons\r\n- Use free time constructively rather than negatively\r\n- Raise Aspirations\r\n\r\nThe project has four key partners, working alongside Shrewsbury Colleges Group to introduce, develop and roll-out the use of augmented reality to youth offenders in different institutions in the specific European countries.\r\n\r\nEach objective will be the focus of a specific work package, that will undertake the key tasks needed to identify, develop and have the resources available to be used by the learners, depending on their need, skills gaps or interest.\r\n\r\nThe AR resources produced during the project will be iAR posters, worksheets and learning cards.

This in the long-term is good for society as it allows offenders to keep update with the digital age.
