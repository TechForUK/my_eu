We, as global citizens, must realize that sustainable development, energy saving, ecological footprint and climate change are global concepts to be tackled locally and individually. The idea is that every single person can make a change, and effects can be enhanced by cooperating.\r\nWe will promote an active citizenship in our pupils, and for this reason, our Erasmus + Students will become Eco-Ambassadors among their peers, Primary students in other city schools, Parents Associations and Local Authorities.  \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on Secondary school students, who will communicate via ICT, by means of our eTwinning common platform, and work together in groups of mixed nationality, using their language skills to negotiate meaning, to put forward their ideas and to compromise.  \r\n\r\nStudents will participate in the following activities, which will take place in classes of a variety of subjects and in special workshops to involve the school community:\r\n- Creation of a logo which will represent our project\r\n- Short stories about ecological issues will be written and a video clip which promotes environmentally-sensitive behaviour will be produced.\r\n- Pupils will analyse their ecological footprints, employing a personal waste or energy diary and invoice analysis (examining the invoices for electricity and heating energy) of their schools or private households.\r\n- Ecological Christmas ornaments and presentations will be produced, in order to promote a sustainable celebration of this season.\r\n- Our project will culminate in the final staging of a Collaborative Theatre Play for which scripts, costumes and stage setting will have been prepared during the transnational meetings.\r\n\r\nOur final objective will be to improve the eco-sensitive behaviour in our Communities; and to enhance, among our students, their self-esteem, critical thinking, leadership, collaborative learning, communication skills, languages and ICT, as a way to improve their future employability in a common European frame.\r\nWe will also focus on the dissemination of the project, not only to enlarge its impact but also as a way of increasing motivation and satisfaction in our daily work inside the classroom, a window to promote welfare and realize that this kind of European project is worth to overstep the classroom walls, in order to open minds and broaden horizons.", "http://www.stags.herts.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA201-004700_2"]]}}, "6EU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1201824000000, 1312070400000, "Space coding in hippocampo-entorhinal neuronal assemblies", "Axona Limited", "Despite impressive advances in almost every field of neuroscience, our insights into brain function remain largely confined to its building blocks at the microscopic level, and to phenomenological descriptions at the macroscopic level. Understanding how complex mental functions originate from electrical and chemical processes in brain cells requires a comprehensive and integrated multi-level analysis focused on neuronal assemblies and microcircuits, where myriads of intricately connected neurons with different properties act together. We shall use the coordinator\u2019s recent discovery of entorhinal grid cells \u2013 a key cell type in the network for spatial representation and navigation \u2013 as a model for neuronal computation in non-sensory cortical microcircuits. The crystal-like structure of the firing fields of grid cells provides an entirely new route to access the neuronal interactions responsible for pattern formation in the brain. Using a forceful combination of computational modelling and novel electrophysiological, optical and molecular research tools never applied for circuit analyses in the brain before, we shall establish the mechanisms by which microcircuits in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex encode, maintain and update representations of location as animals move from one place to another. Insights into the underlying computations have considerable translation potential.

Various epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the stress related to tests and school performance affects generally one third of the children who attend primary education in Europe. The causes of stress can be identified in genetic, biological and environmental factors, many of which are related to the school environment, such as pressure on high academic achievement. Some of the consequences of failing to timely treat anxiety in children result to school failure. \r\nStress is a taught behavior, literature indicates, and thus it can be treated through well structured interventions to all key players of pupils educational environment, which includes peers, teachers and educational staff and parents and families as well. \r\nThe project aims to achieve such an intervention. The objectives of it are targeted to pupils, educational staff and to families as well, attempting an innovative approach since usually pupils stress is treated at an individual level. \r\nThe main objective of the project is to design, develop, test, evaluate and validate a methodology of educational intervention with the respected training material in order to assist pupils obtain skills in order to tackle stressors and handle a stress situation. \r\nObjectives that are pupils oriented include emotional awareness, personal academic strategies skills, and give room to their expressions needs. \r\nThe teachers and staff oriented objectives aim at providing specific stress management skills and knowledge cooperatively construction by organizing transnational learning events in partner countries. \r\nFamilies oriented objectives aim at providing them with information and validated guidelines to support their children well being. \r\nA well structured set of activities were selected by the partnership in order to achieve the objectives that were set. These activities include intra-school research, creation, application, test and validation of methodology and teaching material by fully involving pupils, giving space to their creativity and innovative ideas, and organization of informative events and workshops for the parents / families of the pupils of the participating schools. \r\nApart from these above mentioned project activities, Short Term Joint Staff Training Events have been scheduled to be held in participating countries in order for educators to develop knowledge and skills on stress management in European Classrooms.
