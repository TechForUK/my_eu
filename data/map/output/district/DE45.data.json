Social care employers across the EU see that big changes are required so that services become person centred & driven by the values of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) such as rights, inclusion, choice & independence. \r\n\r\nThe workforce is huge, with a strong tradition in many places of the medical model of care \u2013 explicitly rejected by the UNCRPD as inappropriate \u2013 which needs to be replaced with a new set of values and attitudes based on the social model. This project (EMISC) is about helping bring about that attitudinal change by delineating & supporting the mentoring role in the social care workplace, aimed directly at front line workers who traditionally have had very little training or support, even though their \u2018hands on\u2019 role is critical to the well-being of people with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThis is a contribution alongside other EU wide products (such as the Basic European Social Care Learning Outcomes (BESCLO) & the European Care Certificate (ECC) which are now available in 20 states) to the creation of a European Area of skills and qualification in social care. It offers formal recognition for a role which many experienced staff already undertake  when they guide and help new staff. It also opens routes for mentor and mentees to formal recognition of their learning & skill. In this workforce at this level of operation such opportunities for recognition & development are all too rare.\r\n\r\nEMISC will produce a set of learning outcomes (LO) covering the mentoring function, with related assessment criteria, a mentoring assessment tool (MAT) and a Mentoring Training Course (MTC) to train new mentors. We will also produce a formal curriculum to support the EMISC LO.  We will also produce a Train The Trainer Course as a start-up device for new countries and a formal report on the issues facing the acceptance of transnational learning outcomes, using the experience of our partners.\r\n\r\nThese products will be tested by 4 cycles of mentoring, with a control group of un-mentored candidates. All will be initially assessed and re-assessed at the end & all will sit the European Care Certificate Exam. Results will be compared to demonstrate what the beneficial impact of mentoring can be shown to be. Universal (in English) & \u2018localised\u2019 versions of all products will be freely available.\r\n\r\nWe conservatively estimate 231 people will be trained and assessed (twice) of which 147 will also receive mentoring. In addition each training partner in each state will have 4 people who are able to train new mentors and they will also have 12 trained mentors, able to use the MAT and undertake mentoring.\r\nThe partners will explore formal and informal accreditation options for the EMISC LO, including possibly creating ECVET points and using Memoranda of Understanding between regions/ states/ agencies to promote mutual recognition & acceptance of the assessment of mentors.  A formal report will be compiled, using responses collected by partners in their own countries, on the issues facing the acceptance of transnational learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s products will sit alongside the BESCLO & ECC (though they can be used independently of these) & will be promoted by the circle of ECC users in 20 states as well as via the umbrella body EASPD\u2019s wider membership across the EU. The aim is to spread the use of mentoring as a means of driving changes in services.  \r\n\r\nThe impact on service users, individual new staff and mentors will be immediate, personal and professional. Across whole teams and organisations, managers will have more options to track changes in attitudes & actions of staff in their dealings with the people they support. Inspectors, regulators and those commissioning services will also be encouraged to begin looking for mentors in the workplace.  This is a low cost means of improving care services and marks a beginning of the transfer of power to people who use services. Issues of power and control lie at the heart of attitudes of staff in care services and the UNCRPD is clear with its slogan of \u2018Nothing about us without us\u2019 that staff must be prepared to empower users to get a \u2018real life\u2019 \u2013 with all that means.\r\n\r\nOver time, this is yet another means of eradicating the old \u2018medical model\u2019 of care and creating a common foundation across all care services in the EU, based on the rights, inclusion choice & independence of disabled people seeking to take their rightful place in society.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE02-KA204-012282_2"], [2015, "Sharing The European Pathways", "Social Care Training Ltd", 194028.0, 5, 5, "The EU and its member states are all committed to a policy of de-institutionalisation (DI) and the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD) and the EU\u2019s own 2020 Disability Strategy. DI is a challenging policy and the 4 main partner nations in this project (FI/RO/HU/UK) are at different stages along the way. They have come together to share their experiences and learning and to promote the idea that people with disabilities are \u2018experts by experience\u2019 and can, with appropriate help, contribute to the task of retraining staff and residents of institutions in the process of moving out into community based settings.\r\n\r\nThe STEPS project (Sharing The European Pathways)  provides 2-3 hour long training sessions covering a range of things staff and residents will need to do differently when they move out if the new service is to be based on the UNCRPD principles such as rights, inclusion, choice and independence and not the old \u2018medical model\u2019 of care where \u2018nurse knows best and just do as you are told and we will get along just fine.\u2019  The partners are all either heavily involved in DI processes and/or in the provision of staff training for those working with a disability. A Belgian partner has a dedicated evaluation role.\r\n\r\nThe training materials are all derived from current training packages in the UK & FI, but have been re-fashioned to meet the specific need of this project to provide tailored training opportunities to groups with particular needs.  An additional aspect of this project is the use of \u2018co-trainers\u2019 (who are people with disabilities themselves) as one half of a co-training partnership to train staff, residents and their families/ friends. Not all STEPS training session will require a co-trainer, but experience has shown that using a co-trainer can make a big impact on staff being trained.\r\n\r\nCo-trainers will be coached and given support to fulfil their role. We hope this will be the start of  wider use of co-trainers. Materials will be made freely available in \u2018universal\u2019 format in English (ie with no reference to any one country, institution or place etc) and they will be \u2018localised\u2019 by partners so they will look and feel like a local document, with recognisable local names, places, laws etc.  \u2018Easy Read\u2019 versions of relevant documents will be available.\r\n\r\nThe training sessions deal with both practical matters from the point of view of residents, their families and staff \u2013 such as; handling personal and household money, doing the shopping and the cooking, keeping the house clean, getting on with the neighbours etc and also more attitudinal/philosophical matters \u2013 such as: who is \u2018in charge\u2019 in \u2018my\u2019 home? Are staff \u2018carers\u2019 or enablers? What do we do about people taking risks?\r\n\r\nWe will collect feedback from all the training sessions and from manager of services where STEPS training has taken place. There will be two cycles of training to allow for review and revision of the materials and methods used.  Co-training partnerships will be supported by a number of senior trainers who will all have attended an intensive 5 day training course to learn the materials thoroughly. We will seek formal approval for the STEPS training from the relevant bodies. \r\n\r\nWe hope that the results will be staff who are better trained and supported to fulfil their new role and work in a new manner, seeing themselves as supporting someone to \u2018get a life\u2019 in the community, rather then caring for them and controlling every aspect of their lives. We hope people with disabilities who moved out and their families will begin to see changes in the way staff work and will themselves come to realise that people with disabilities have the right to live as near normal lives as possible in the community.  With the right kind of support, many can do this and the job of enabling them do this and seeing them blossom into full rounded characters is very rewarding for all concerned.\r\n\r\nDI is not easy to do well. Changing the attitudes of staff who have worked in an institution and the residents who have lived there is not easy either. STEPS will provide those charged with delivering on DI with more effective tools for making this change.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-HU01-KA204-013570_1"], [2017, "Adult education Courses on Capacity-building for the Employment and Support of Self-advocates", "Social Care Training Ltd", 185390.0, 4, 4, "The importance of lifelong learning and a constant improvement of personal skills is nowadays a basic requirement in all fields of employment. The rapidly changing world has a tendency of knowledge lapsing swiftly therefore constant learning and adjustment of skills is a must. Computer skills and foreign language skills are basic knowledge and basic requirements at all fields of employment. The employment rate of persons with intellectual disabilities are very low, especially at the open labour market, which naturally leads to poverty and social isolation. \r\nPeople with  disabilities are largely excluded from digital society, from opportunities for lifelong learning and from the labor market.\r\n \r\nHungary is way behind the European mean of adult education programs in general regarding the quantity as well as the quality of these programs. Besides the strong tradition and relative high standard of special education in the school system, persons with intellectual disabilities has little to none opportunities of improving skills and learning as adults in Hungary. Special education system provides (mandatory) learning until the age of 16, further education can be found only occasionally and mainly focused on vocational training and aims to acquire a specific profession (such as gardening, carpenter, weaving, etc.). Important general skills such as computer usage, IT knowledge and the related security and safety issues, foreign language learning are not part of any school system that provides special courses for persons with intellectual disabilities. There are very few opportunities at mainstream adult education where they can practice and improve skills and this disadvantaged group \u2013 mostly living from a very low income  - can not afford to attend such a course. Although it is well-known that these skills can be effectively trained in adulthood, sufficient solution to this growing need has not yet been found, mainstream training centres are lacking special knowledge and methodology in implementation of training materials for persons with intellectual disabilities. \r\nThe development of teaching and learning materials, especially designed to teach persons with intellectual disabilities (and related developmental disabilities) would be a huge step forward to the improvement of adult education for persons with disabilities. Besides the actual training materials (trainers guide, learner handbook) specific methodology will be implemented in the training for the teachers. \r\nThe aim of the project is to develop and implement specially designed training programs for persons with intellectual disabilities, in the fields of basic spoken English and basic IT knowledge in order to consolidate and strengthen the status of these persons at the open labour market. With the project an international cooperation can be implemented where the national best practices could be shared and used to develop a universal version of the training program. Universal versions would be localized by each partner organization, based on the local needs and specialities. \r\nEach main topic (basic spoken English, basic IT and internet safety) to be developed would contain a trainer\u2019s guide and a learner\u2019s handbook. \r\nThe English partners have a long-term practice and experience in the field of adult education of persons with intellectual disabilities as well as the other partners . Hungary has little experience in the development of specific training programs  for persons with intellectual disabilities, therefore it is essential to have an opportunity to share knowledge and learn transnationally.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA204-035947_2"], [2017, "I DECIDE: Supported Decision Making using Digital Literacy & Numeracy skills", "Social Care Training Ltd", 162693.0, 5, 6, "This 3 year project with 6 partners aims to combine the need to improve the Digital, Literacy and Numeracy (DLN) skills of adults with intellectual and/or psychosocial  disabilities with an individual\u2019s desire to exercise more choice and control over their lives, by becoming involved in supported decision making (SDM) affecting themselves in 3 key area \u2013 personal finance, healthcare and consumer rights. The project also aims to improve the opportunities for and levels of social inclusion of people as a result of these activities.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a local \u2018supporter\u2019 and some dedicated materials around each of these three areas, people with intellectual and/or psychosocial disabilities will be encouraged to learn how to do things (eg budgeting, understanding money, and health monitoring, opening a bank account etc) all of which will require them to work on and improve their DLN skills. This will enable them to have more say in decision which affect their lives on a day to day basis. \r\n\r\nTraining programmes for supporters will be provided, along with capacity building capabilities through a Train the Trainer Course. Guides for users, families, supporters, managers and staff and \u2018decision makers\u2019 (trustees, directors etc) will explain how it all works and what SDM is.  Supporting organisations will be invited to sign up to a public SDM Charter to demonstrate their support and commitment.\r\n\r\nThe project will explore the possibility of finding local formal methods of assessing DLN skills at low entry levels, so that learning can be recognised. Improvements in DLN skill levels and the capacity to become involved in decision making will be noted over the three years.  Other developments, such as improved social inclusion and a any reduction in difficult behaviour, will also be noted. Local User groups will be set up to assist the project\u2019s growth and development. \r\n\r\nThe potential impact of the project is significant, affecting not only the individual being helped, but also their families and friends, their own \u2018supporter\u2019, other staff and services.  Adult education services may be affected in that this project aims to demonstrate an effective but alternative way of  providing adult education in DLN skills, which may lead to pressure for them to adopt and/or support it elsewhere.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA204-038185_5"]]}}}}
