Three detailed pathways towards a resource efficient Europe are described.", "Efficient resource usage is a key element of sustainability, and thus a key priority for Europe. The 'Policy options for a resource-efficient economy' (http://www.polfree.eu (POLFREE)) project addresses four key questions: 'Why are resources often used inefficiently?', 'What new concepts and paradigm would support more efficient usage?', 'What would a resource-efficient Europe look like?', and 'What steps must be taken to achieve resource efficiency?' The eight-member-consortium project runs between October 2012 and March 2016.\n\nThe research starts by constructing a theoretical framework for understanding the barriers to an efficient use of resources. The framework develops the notion of web of constraints, moving beyond the notion of a \u2018barrier\u2019 to efficient resource use. The project explores different concepts and paradigms that could provide the basis for a resource-efficient economy. Specific policy mixes are then proposed that might be expected to lead to resource-efficient economies. Three scenarios were constructed envisaging the development of resource efficiency in Europe and exploring the implications of policy interventions, under different global conditions, in respect of resource use, CO2 emissions and economic growth, through the linkage of two macroeconomic models and a bio-physical model.\n\nWork during the first 18 months focused on developing the required theoretical framework and understanding of the web of constraints that explains inefficient use of resources. To date, 13 deliverables have been submitted and are available on the http://www.polfree.eu (project's website).\n\nThe framework identifies a complex pattern of constraints on resource efficiency. From the legislative perspective, the analysis points to a current focus on the output or environmental side of resource usage, yet gaps exist on the input or material side. The work also suggests a need for more coherence and guidance at the EU level, combined with better stakeholder coordination at national levels. Looking at behavioural constraints, the study suggests that consumption practices are largely influenced by people\u2019s participation in social practices and settings and are not just the outcome of personal attitudes, values and individual decisions.\n\nAnalysis of over 150 cases showed that successful new business models include intermediate companies seeking efficient paradigms. The study also points to a number of areas with greatest potential for businesses: green (business) services, cradle-to-cradle approaches, and industrial symbiosis. It is suggested that changes in the framework conditions in which companies operate are required to scale up the uptake of resource efficiency and new business models. Hence, resource efficiency must be tackled at the international and corporate levels.", null, "http://www.international-synergies.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-06/155658.jpg", "fp7_104291_983118475"], ["3JN", "MIRROR - Reflective Learning at Work", "Registered Nursing Home Association Limited", "Due to the dynamics in business environments and the large number of changes in job roles and tasks for employees, a time-consuming development of formal learning offers and the organisational-wide provision of vocational training are barriers for the wide adoption and use of learning technologies.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan.

Yet, for all its dynamism, the sector is also becoming more crowded and ambitious young entrepreneurs are looking upwards and outwards for further growth opportunities.  Viable paths to expansion include moving to fixed premises, manufacturing value added products for retail and franchising mobile units. By growing this way, street food entrepreneurs are able to create more resilient businesses with higher employment and turnover.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, today\u2019s street food entrepreneurs tend to be young, first time business owners and although they have developed useful skills they are often self-taught and lack formal enterprise education. Hence there is a clear argument for providing timely, tailored business training enabling them to overcome the strategic and operational challenges of scaling up. \r\n\r\nThen again, unless food entrepreneurs work in a region conducive to innovation and strategic food marketing, their efforts will be truncated.  Collective action is required: local authorities and economic development stakeholders must also grasp the potential of the street food movement to evolve into a vibrant regional food scene based on high quality, local produce, accessibility and authenticity. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Street Food: Opportunities for Regions aims to deliver high training for street food entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, at the same time as it works with HEIs and business development organizations that provide VET for the food sector, and wider economic development stakeholders to harness food SMEs as a driver of regional growth.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we will: \r\na) Engage 50- 60 high level stakeholder organizations in 5 Regional Alliances. Together they will \r\nstudy the evolution of the street food phenomenon, devise and implement 5 Regional Action Plans to boost the growth of innovative food entrepreneurs and their contribution to economic development and tourism at regional level. \r\nb) Publish a \u201cStreet Food: Opportunities for Regions\u201d Toolkit to facilitate the replication of Regional Alliances of this nature across Europe.\r\nc) Create Street Food Success: What\u2019s Next? a course curriculum and learning materials to help street food entrepreneurs grow their businesses successfully\r\nd) Trial the course with at least 50 street food entrepreneurs in participating countries, and 25 VET trainers, then publish the course, and engage in dissemination activities and events to facilitate its inclusion in mainstream VET provision.\r\n\r\nStreet Food: Opportunities for Regions has been carefully structured to generate impact for current street food entrepreneurs and the VET providers who serve them, as well as creating wider benefits for the HEI-VET community and overall regional economic development. \r\n\r\nAt individual level, street food entrepreneurs who take the course are more likely to grow their businesses, moving into new markets and products with greater confidence and skills for success.

All these factors mean that young people are attracted to opportunities within the dynamic sector that can increase youth employment opportunities  central to the EU's employment policy,  Europe 2020. \r\n\r\nIn France  youth unemployment stands at 24% compared to a EU average of 17% (Eurostat, Feb 2017).  In Ireland , UK and Malta, youth under-employment is a concern, as young people fail to find jobs commensurate with their education and talents.   Entrepreneurship is widely recognized as a means to combat youth unemployment and social exclusion and thanks to the Entrepreneurship Action Plan more and more young people now gain access to entrepreneurial experience before leaving school or university.  \r\n\r\nBut what about the young people already outside the education system, and facing unemployment, underemployment or disadvantage in the labour market?    SFOFY is based on the premise that we can \u2013and must\u2013 do more to build entrepreneurial skills among this group of young people with raw talent.
