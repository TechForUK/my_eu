As especially urban climate is heating up worldwide, acclimatised personal transport is getting more and more the norm, as opposed to taking a bicycle to work. Epsilon aims to conceptualize, develop and prototype a new category of vehicle in between the ultra compact (urban) car and present day moped category small covered vehicles or semi-covered scooters. Epsilon underwrites the 'hard' performance targets defined in the call topic and seeks to meet these while ensuring a very competitive level of affordability and safety. Epsilon can achieve this by means of leveraging the substantial amount of previous and parallel (national & EU-funded) R&D of other projects in which epsilon partners participate, combined with the specific skills and expertise of the consortium members. As such it focuses on optimally integrating cutting edge yet available on prototype level components, materials, manufacturing technologies and subsystems into a drivable prototype plus 2 crash tested body structures. The extensive real experimental testing in combination with advanced performance simulations will allow full confidence verification of the performance of the vehicle and also will allow for strong promotion of the accomplished innovation. Epsilon takes very serious care of the fit between vehicle classes as agreed in European and worldwide standards and the characteristics of the vehicle to be developed. The epsilon consortium includes 1 major carmaker, 1 automotive supplier, 3 specialized electric car engineering / prototyping companies and 4 research centres from 5 EU countries.", 318606.0, 2696465.0, "EPSILON", null, null, null, "http://www.epsilon-project.eu/", null, null, "fp7_110869_957872479"], ["7RG", "Industrial Production Processes for Nanoreinforced Composite Structures", "Axon Automotive Limited", "The main modules of INCOM project are 1) NFC production/modification process 2) Composites consolidation 3) Mechanical testing and modelling. The core of the project is the manufacturing and modification of the nanocellulose. Two alternative approaches for the manufacturing of the in-situ modified nanocellulose will be used: Masuko and pearl milling. Both processes will be conducted in the pre-polymer (monomer or oligomer), thus avoiding the problems related to incompatibility of the aqueous medium and plastics and creating an optimal, homogenous dispersion of the nanofibres in the resin which will be cured to the composite structure. Further, equally important advantage of this approach is the possibility to achieve consistencies 20 \u2013 50 times higher than those possible in water medium. During the fibrillation, acrylic and epoxy grafting of the cellulose will be conducted to enable permanent, covalent bonding of the reinforcement fibre into the polymer matrix to be formed during the next step of the processing. Once produced, the resin containing the functionalised nanoreinforcement will be used for the following components of the structural sandwich composite: A) Expanded, nano-reinforced core. The core is produced using chemical and physical blowing agents, resulting in a low density (<50 kg/m3) foams with high compression strength. B) Nano-reinforced skin. The resin containing the nano-fibre reinforcement will be used to dispersion coat the expanded core, followed by curing with IR/UV. Alternatively, supports produced by fibre forming processes (foam forming) are impregnated with the resin, and cured in contact with the core. Parallel with the development of the expanded thermoset core, an inline production process based on expanded thermoplastic core will be developed. The system is based on coating of extrusion profiles with the nano-reinforced resin. UV curing is integrated in the process to facilitate the formation of the cured, reinforced skin layer.", 136446.0, 3969854.0, "INCOM", null, null, null, "http://www.incomproject.eu", null, null, "fp7_109049_957872479"], ["7RG", "High productivity manufacturing process of composite parts based on zero emissions\nfast curing coatings and heated moulds", "Axon Automotive Limited", "The proposed project aims to the development of an ecological and innovative coating for composite parts which may be able to eliminate the styrene emissions from the workplace.

These materials will improve public safety and environmental impact by eliminating halogenated fire-retardants, which produce toxic combustion products. The ability of well-dispersed nanoparticles to enhance the fire-retardancy of thermoplastic polymers is well-established, but thermoset polyester has received relatively little attention. In a recent collaborative project, the fire-retardancy of polyester resin was dramatically improved on a lab scale by adding small amounts of organomodified nanoclay, along with significantly reduced amounts of other, non-halogen fire-retardant additives. However, significant further work is required to scale-up production and to assess the health and environmental impacts. This project will develop and upscale the nanoclay modification and will use novel mixing techniques to enable industrial-scale production of the nano-filled polyester. The project will generate turn-key solutions for easy integration into industrial SMEs. Nanocomposites and coatings will be produced and subjected to stringent tests.

The addition of novel multi-functional additives to the bulk resin of fibre reinforced composites will allow the achievement of these advanced functionalities.\n\nMulti-scale numerical modelling methods will be adopted to enable a materials by design approach to the development of materials with novel structural hierarchies.
