The latest UK statistics indicate that the highest workplace fatalities occur within this sector. Previous project partner research also reported related health & safety concerns within this sector & developed a framework for common European VET competence standards. These standards can be adapted & developed further for use within the WAH occupations. At the same time this project aims to facilitate best practice & high quality instruction amongst VET providers & skills trainers of WAH courses across Europe & beyond, exchanging knowledge, innovations & expertise in the process.\r\n\r\nProject Objectives:\r\nThe ultimate project goal is to \u2018raise safety standards\u2019 & \u2018reduce accidents & fatalities\u2019 of workers at height within agriculture & the environment. The 7 key project objectives to successfully achieve this goal are as follows:\r\n1. Organise & run trainer technical standard setting events \r\n2. Organise & run trainer technical evaluation and verification events \r\n3. Produce trainer Codes of Practice, training guides etc for WAH \r\n4. Produce a project web page/social media links & blogs \r\n5. Develop a high quality VET provider & trainer e-knowledge library  \r\n6. Develop a Data Warehouse incorporating web-based analysis tools i.e. statistical analysis of fatalities/accidents etc\r\n7. Develop 3 new European occupational standards & related competence certification in the safe use of chainsaws & other equipment for WAH within agriculture & the environment\r\n\r\nProject Participants:\r\nThe project consists of a very experienced & capable partnership of 12 organisations tasked to ensure its success. Their make-up consists of VET & project management specialists, private & public bodies, non-profit organisations, e-learning, WAH & adult education specialists & government institutions in the education & agriculture sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Activities:\r\nOver the project lifecycle the partnership will undertake numerous tasks in pursuit of the ultimate VET-Safety goal. These include for example:\r\n\u2022 VET-Industry consultations\r\n\u2022 Meeting presentations\r\n\u2022 WAH training techniques analysis\r\n\u2022 WAH competency developments\r\n\u2022 WAH incident evaluations\r\n\u2022 Project dissemination on many levels across numerous sectors\r\n\u2022 International certification events\r\n\u2022 Training publications & guidance materials etc\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Methodology:\r\nThe project will be undertaken in 4 stages within its lifecycle as follows.\r\n\r\nStage 1: (Pre-cycle)\r\nUndertake pre-project planning & preparation meetings\r\nDevelop an effective management plan, project organisational structure & dissemination plan\r\nSchedule the objectives into an action plan of individual tasks & work packages\r\nResource & run trainer standard setting events in partner countries & develop VET training standards\r\nMonitor & evaluate feedback & disseminate information gathered till end of project\r\nPromote project information through the web, social media links etc till end of project\r\n\r\nStage 2: (Mid-cycle)\r\nResource & run trainer evaluation and verification events in partner countries & develop VET assessment standards\r\nPilot test new WAH competency certifications in partner countries\r\nUndertake post-project sustainability planning & preparation meetings\r\nDevelop VET trainer QA materials & e-tools & data warehouse\r\nProduce a project interim report & evaluate findings\r\n\r\nStage 3: (End-cycle)\r\nLive test new WAH competency certifications in partner countries\r\nCompletion of VET trainer QA materials & e-tools & data warehouse\r\nDevelop a project \u2018Exit Strategy\u2019\r\nProject End & final report & evaluation of the findings\r\n\r\nStage 4: (Post-cycle)\r\nAnalysis of project feedback\r\nContinued development, dissemination & enhancement of project products & goals\r\n\r\nProject Impact:\r\nThe project will reach its objectives via enhancement of current training products available but more importantly through completely NEW partnership innovations focused on VET WAH safety. These are:\r\n1. Web based VET knowledge library: e-LIBRARY \r\n2. International VET Data Warehouse & associated incident analysis & reporting tools \r\n3. Safe use of ladders & MEWPS & emergency rescue techniques VET qualification \r\n4. Aerial use & safety of a chainsaw VET qualification \r\n5. Safe use of winches in manual & mechanised lifting & pulling operations VET qualification \r\nThe web based e-tools will enhance training experience, course delivery methods & benefiting both the trainer & trainee. These tools associated with 3 new European qualifications accredited & delivered to high quality standards will have an immediate impact in helping to reduce accidents & fatalities. Longer-term development of these across Europe will lead to further reductions in accidents & fatalities & increased worker safety on a wider scale supported by the unique predictive analysis capability of the VET Data Warehouse", "http://www.a1-arborists.com", "A1 Arborists LTD/Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA202-001870_coordinator"], ["5EN", "European Utility Arborist", "A1 Arborists LTD/Limited", 281976.0, "Project Background:\r\nThe EU-ARB project has been designed to the meet the needs of arborists involved within high risk UA activities particularly within energy sectors of industry responsible for vegetation/tree management. Recent European & UK statistics indicate a rising workplace fatality rate associated with hazardous work undertaken by arborists. Previous project partner research also reported related health & safety concerns within this sector & developed a framework for common European VET competence standards. These standards can be adapted & developed further for use within the Utility Arboriculture (UA) occupations. At the same time this project aims to facilitate best practice & high quality instruction amongst VET providers & skills trainers of UA courses across Europe & beyond, exchanging knowledge, training innovations & expertise in the process leading to safer trained arborists.\r\n\r\nKey Needs:\r\nThe ultimate project goal & key needs are as follows:\r\n1. Improve & enhance utility arborists skills, safety & supervision in the workplace through the development of a simplified qualification structure on 3 very practical & industry relevant levels\r\n2. Reduce utility arborist fatality & incident rates particularly where adjacent to energised power lines in the workplace\r\n3. Reduce associated economic & personal costs related to UA accidents \r\n \r\nKey Objectives:\r\nAchieving the key needs requires the following objectives to be met:\r\n1. Develop innovative European occupational standards in UA \r\n2. Improve transparency and recognition of UA skills via innovative European qualifications accredited by ABA International\r\n3. Enhance utility arborists mobility and employability throughout Europe \r\n4.
