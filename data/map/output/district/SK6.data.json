Moreover, STORM will determine how different vulnerable materials, structures and buildings are affected by different extreme weather events together with risks associated to climatic conditions or natural hazards, offering improved, effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, systems and technologies. An integrated system featuring novel sensors (intra fluorescent and wireless acoustic sensors), legacy systems, state of the art platforms (including LiDAR and UAVs), as well as crowdsourcing techniques will be implemented, offering applications and services over an open cloud infrastructure. \nAn important result of STORM will be a cooperation platform for collaboratively collecting and enhancing knowledge, processes and methodologies on sustainable and effective safeguarding and management of European Cultural Heritage. The system will be capable of performing risk assessment on natural hazards taking into account environmental and anthropogenic risks, and of using Complex Events processing. Results will be tested in relevant case studies in five different countries: Italy, Greece, UK, Portugal and Turkey. The sites and consortium have been carefully selected so as to adequately represent the rich European Cultural Heritage, while associate partners that can assist with liaisons and links to other stakeholders and European sites are also included.\nThe project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team providing all competences needed to assure the implementation of a functional and effective solution to support all the actors involved in the management and preservation of Cultural Heritage sites.", 352888.0, 6329542.0, "STORM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_202681_926377452"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4NE", "Moving French Forward at RPS", "Romiley Primary School", 10051.0, "Romiley Primary School is an above average-sized primary school in the North West of England. \r\n\r\nAt Romiley, French is currently taught across KS2 (8 junior classes). Years 5 and 6 are taught by a voluntary part time languages teacher. Both Year 3 classes are taught by a teacher with 'A' level French and Year 4 are taught by a teacher with no qualifications in French.  We are concerned about the level of consistency and realise that this is not a sustainable model. \r\n\r\nAdvice from Network meetings strongly suggests that the best model is for class teachers to teach language lessons themselves through a weekly lesson and daily parcels. However, many of our staff lack the skills, knowledge and confidence in their own French language skills to take this role on at the moment.  \r\n\r\nSome staff have attended local training courses and are beginning to take an active role in their French lessons, however, since teaching a foreign language become statutory in September 2014, we now need to ensure our children make substantial progress in the four years from age 7 - 11 years. We have therefore identified the following objectives as our main areas of language development:\r\n\r\n- improving the personal French language skills of staff\r\n- incorporating age-appropriate methods and activities for teaching FL to young children in to planning\r\n- developing an awareness of the culture of France amongst staff and children\r\n- making the learning of French relevant for our children\r\n- linking French to other curriculum areas\r\n\r\nTo meet these training needs, we are in the process of applying for Erasmus+ Key Action 1 funding to allow 6 staff members the opportunity to spend time in France studying on short language, methodology and culture courses in France. The six staff will work in teams of two. Each pair will attend 8-day courses and on their return will lead a programme of internal staff training to pass their new skills on to colleagues. \r\n\r\nThe visits will be spread out over 2 years, allowing the school to embed the new practice and move forward before the next team attends and repeats the process. As well as increasing their own language skills, each team will have a project focus while they are in France, this will maximise the development opportunities for the whole staff and improve the learning experience for the pupils.\r\n\r\nFollowing recommendations, we have chosen a course provider who meets our training needs and have selected our first two participants through a fair and open process. The courses we have selected also feature a day in a French primary school, giving our teachers an opportunity to learn about a new education system and the children new French friends to learn to speak \r\n\r\nBaseline data and observations are being gathered and monitoring points have been planned in to the school calender to measure impact. We are confident that our project will impact across the whole school and expect to see:\r\n- an increase in French language skills and confidence in teaching in all staff\r\n- a wealth of new ideas and cross-curricular resources to inspire and enthuse our pupils\r\n- more teachers timetabled to teach French\r\n- a growing understanding of French culture and what it means to be French\r\n- \"real\" opportunities to read and write French as children correspond with their new friends in the French school\r\n\r\nWhen our project ends, we will write a final report and share the results with many target groups.\r\n\r\nIn the long term we expect to see a sustainable model of quality language teaching that ignites our pupils' curiosity about the world.", "http://www.romileyprimary.com", "Romiley Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012730_coordinator"], ["5BR", "Language Learning for Everyone in Our School Community", "St Marys Catholic Primary School", 20105.0, "This project, Language Learning for Everyone in Our School Community, using the Erasmus+ Key Action 1 programme, has been proposed by St Mary's Catholic Primary School, a small school of approximately 250 pupils in Marple Bridge, a suburb of Stockport in the North West of England. \r\n\r\nOver a period of two years, the school plans to send ten staff members, including Teachers and Teaching Assistants on eight-day immersion courses in Carcassonne, France.  The project's objectives are to develop the linguistic competency, confidence and intercultural awareness of staff to enable them to teach French to primary school children within a cross-curricular context.  The participants currently have little or no experience of living in France and the majority have no language qualifications higher than a GCSE in French. \r\n\r\nParticipants will receive 14 hours of intensive, personalised language training in small ability groups. They will also be set activities and tasks to allow them to become immersed in the local culture and develop the confidence to apply their language skills in real-life situations. They will gather authentic resources to engage children in language learning.   Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to spend time in a French school, allowing them to develop their understanding of life in a French school and foster links for future partnerships. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the project, teachers will have higher confidence and competency in teaching French within a cross-curricular context and sharing their intercultural knowledge.  Children at the school will be highly engaged in language learning and will demonstrate the confidence to apply their language skills in a variety of curriculum areas.  Children will also demonstrate a higher level of intercultural awareness and make significant progress with their French language skills as they move through the school and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be disseminated throughout the school community and beyond.

Our partnership would like to enhance training provision of future school leaders, starting from South Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and Romania) and expanding across whole Europe. Our main objectives are to:- design learning outcomes framework in school leadership;- develop a 5-month multilingual training programme in educational leadership and an online multilingual community learning space for supporting the training process;- train 10 online mentors from 6 partner countries to support the implementation of the training programme;- engage 20 senior teachers from Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece and Romania in a 5-month pilot test of the training programme;- disseminate project activities and results across teachers\u2019 communities in the 6 partner countries through a series of demonstrative events and social media campaigns.Our main target group are senior teachers, who possess potential, competences and experience to be quickly trained for school management positions and adopt the educational leadership paradigm, needed for handling current and future challenges faced by schools and school education systems in general. Our training programme for future school leaders embraces innovation in several dimensions:- Training contents: will integrate all topics and concepts such as Learning-centred leadership, Distributed leadership, Community and Network leadership with additional emphasis on the role of school leader as a coach for high achievements, networker and system thinker. The training knowledge base will reflect a cross-sectoral perspective on learning management (school education, VET, non-formal learning (youth) and the world of business).- Learning methods: will combine online education, self-directed learning, mentor support and peer collaboration. In addition, the whole process will be based on project-based learning concept. The future school leaders will have to engage in real leadership tasks during their training, which will allow for direct application of new knowledge acquired. - Follow-up: the online learning space will serve as a virtual community for exchange of know-how and provide mutual mentoring on school leaderships issues with school leaders on national and European levels, which will ensure continuous development of participants after their graduation. It will act as a self-developing professional development platform.Our main intellectual outputs (training programme, online learning space and policy recommendations) will have the following quality effects (intangible results) as follows: * Senior teachers involved in the focus groups will improve their understanding of educational leadership topic and develop a comparative perspective on its applications in different national contexts across Europe.* Senior teachers involved in the testing edition of the training programmes will develop or improve their knowledge, skills and attitude in the field of educational leadership.* Senior teachers reached with dissemination activities will improve their awareness on the topic of educational leadership and the prospects/benefits of engaging in a school management role.* Staff members of the participating organizations engaged as online mentors will raise their knowledge on the topics of educational leadership, online learning processes and the role of mentoring support.* Staff members of partner organizations in general will yield knowledge on international know-how in the field of educational leadership and improve their skills in development of online educational innovations.* Other training providers will be offered new concepts and methods for delivering educational leadership programs on both national and transnational level, which they can use for the development of their own training provision portfolios. * Decision makers will be provided with evidence base for conducting successful reforms in the field of school staff qualifications and preparation (initial and continuous training).The new approaches implemented by educational leaders trained within our programme will lead in the long run to better educational achievements of students, low rates of early school leavers and rising motivation for higher education enrollment, moving education systems closer to Europe 2020 targets.", "http://www.allourfutures.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BG01-KA201-023640_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK6"}
