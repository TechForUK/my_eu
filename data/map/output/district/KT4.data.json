The available therapies are insufficient to fulfill the need. The introduction of statins has reduced morbidity and mortality of atherosclerosis by 30%, however a large untreatable residual cardiovascularrisk remains even in cohorts of treated patients.  Currently, many targets for CVD treatment have been selected based on mechanism of action and inference of functions in cellular models to clinical systems, and lack the rigorous clinical validation needed to maximize the chance for successful clinical drug development. Consequently, new drugs that modulate the activity of such targets fail later in clinical development by lack of efficacy or induction of safety liabilities due to off-target effects. To increase the success rate for clinical development of novel therapies in CVD, we will follow an innovative approach by using: 1. Independent and large-scale population studies from which novel targets with strong correlation to clinical phenotypes are deduced; 2. Translational disease-mimicking models (cellular and animal) to validate novel drug targets; 3. High quality human biobanks to confirm the molecular relevance of targets in diseased cardiovascular tissues; 4. A stringent pharmaceutical drug discovery process for prioritization of drugable targets. An important concept, in line with the changed pharmaceutical business model, is that these steps can best be executed by a functional network of clinical academic centers and specialized SMEs under the guidance of established and experienced drug discovery researchers from industry that brings together the right components and expertise to execute such a modular target discovery process.'", 160261.0, 6401174.0, "CARTARDIS", null, null, null, "http://cartardis.eu/", null, null, "fp7_109476_951251938"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7JZ", "Earth Core", "HANTA ASSOCIATES LIMITED", 369331.0, "The expansion of renewable energies  assumes a key role in the development of sustainable growth in Southern Italy.The development of renewable energy can encourage a reduction in Italy\u2019s(high) rate of dependence on foreignenergy and can therefore help to increase both our energy efficiency and energyindependence.The South Italy presents nationally competitive advantages in terms of power produced by renewable(solar, wind and biomass)energies;Geothermal energy, especially in the South,could also offer important opportunities in the production of thermal energy(used to heat and to cool) and, in the longer term, in the production of electricity. Italy has an abundance of geothermal energy possibilities, the sources of geothermal energy present in Italy is only exceeded by Iceland in Europe. The South with theinclusion of Tuscany and Lazio are the regions richest in geothermal resources, especially in Campania and Puglia.Different studies have shown that sustainable energy innovation could create up to 200,000 jobsin the renewableenergysector(with the development of new professionsrelated to so-called green skills) whichwould rise to more than 600.000 when we consider those involved in building and regenerating buildings (Legambiente). These are not random numbersplucked from the sky, in Germany for example400,000 people area already employed in renewable energy thanks to a favorable policy development and incentives for working towards energy efficiency.Italy could follow this example and not only benefit in terms of having control of their own energy but also creating jobs in the process and laying the foundations for a long standing and successful industry.Starting from this analysis, the idea of the project Earth Core is born, as an opportunity for new technical high school graduates to receive a training in the renewable energy sector in a European context that will allow them to be competitive in a world more and more competitive and where in the face of such many business challenges, the most powerful weapon available to operators in this sector is a formation pointing to the quality and innovation that focuses on environmental compliance.As a general objective, Earth Core aims to create qualified professionals able to import and contextualize the good practices in the field of renewable energy, especially in geothermal energy, on their territory. It promotes the birth of a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in the field, launching at the same time awareness activities in this regard, by promoting geothermal energy as a clean and free renewable source.Specific objectives:- Adressed to 100 new high school graduates from technical institutes in the fields of mechanics, mechatronics and energy; electronics and electrical engineering; construction, environment and territory and it aims at a training that will help them developing new skills and providing them with greater expertise in the field of geothermal energy source and more generally of renewable energy sources;- It aims to provide an educational experience that is relevant to the labor market;- It aims to address the problem of low education of young high school graduates, that is one of the causes of youth unemployment and the need for a stronger link between vocational training, employment and entrepreneurship.

D.I.C.K. was born after a careful analysis of the needs expressed by the members of the partnership and the examination of potential economic growth that Calabria territory could enable through a better training of its human resources and a better  marketing action for the positioning of food products in international market.\r\nThe Calabria region ( especially the territories  represented by the municipalities that are project partners) is characterized by an important agricultural and touristic potential. These territories despite their cultural and natural heritage, and the development of enogastronomic sector have been experiencing high rates of unemployment .\r\nThe region and the province of Reggio Calabria are not sufficiently able to enhance and promote their products. The high quality of products is not enough for the development if a marketing strategy is not implemented and  human resources are not really qualified.\r\nStarting from these considerations, MOB.Y. DICK was born to train adequate resources who can help face the challenges and opportunities coming from the global market and bring attention on agricultural and agri-food enterprises management. The objectives of the project are:\r\n1.To encourage a greater awareness of the opportunities that food industry can represent for territorial development;\r\n2.To train human resources able to answer global market modern needs;\r\n3.To work for a gradual and progressive adjustment of training systems according the real business needs, starting from the international experience and taking into account the European ECVET system of skills certification;\r\n4.To learn, through cooperation with foreign partners, good practices in the field of business management and marketing;\r\n5.To stimulate a greater dialogue among all stakeholders involved in the field of agribusiness and territorial development.\r\n\r\nMOB.Y.

The training course will target unemployed young people from all over Europe and neighbouring countries and will enhance their skills regarding social entrepreneurship as a means to transit to labour market and solve social problems. \r\nObserving the region of Europe, two major problems are encountered among youth\u2019s society; on one hand there is a high rate of educated but unemployed youth and on the other hand social exclusion, discrimination and lack of access to human rights threatens society and especially vulnerable groups. \r\n\r\nThe proposed training course intends to combine these two problems and transform them into the solution: social entrepreneurship. A social entrepreneur is a person who identifies or recognizes a social problem and uses entrepreneurial principles to organize, create, and manage a social venture to achieve a desired social change. According to Dees  social entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs with a social mission, which for them is very explicit and central. By generating social entrepreneurs, youth will accomplish simultaneously; their own transition from education to labour market and at the same time, a social change which will improve their own, but also others\u2019 youth access to human rights, social inclusion and respect. \r\nFor this reasons, the aim of the activity is to develop participants\u2019 social entrepreneurship skills, targeting thus a long term and sustainable impact on local societies of Europe. After the training course, participants are expected to act as social entrepreneurs, supporting their own autonomy and the society in general. \r\n\r\nThe training course will cover the thematic of youth unemployment, social exclusion and social entrepreneurship. Particularly, it will engage participants to reflect on the current situation regarding youth unemployment in Europe and invite them to conceptualize social exclusion, discrimination and xenophobia, especially when combined with unemployment. Most importantly, the training course will challenge participants\u2019 creativity, empower them and develop their social entrepreneurship skills.\r\nThe aim of the project is to develop participants\u2019 social entrepreneurship skills which will be used as a means to support their autonomy and transition to the labour market. At the same time, because of the social character of this particular entrepreneurship they will target social change for a more inclusive world, sustainability and access to human rights. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, the  objectives of the training course are:\r\nTo explore current situation regarding unemployment and social exclusion and the link between them\r\nTo work with the social entrepreneurship principles\r\nTo learn how the Erasmus+ Programme can support youth activities;\r\nTo increase entrepreneurial skills especially social entrepreneurial skills for youth and pertinent contribution to enhancing entrepreneurial skills, development of economic equity, equality of chances, removing barriers to the labour market and discrimination. \r\nTo promote participatory process for youth in the labour market and amend their economic and social condition to better.\r\nTo raise awareness about the need for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth to the wider public;\r\n\r\nBy the end of the training, participants are expected to have their own strategic plan as social entrepreneurs. By the end of the training course they will it in order to implement their initiatives. Also, participants will gather and organize all information they find useful in the guide \u201cSteps towards social entrepreneurship\u201d. The guide will be disseminated to other NGOs.\r\nDuring the 7-days training course, the project team will use non formal education methods to achieve the 3 concrete objectives and the aim stated in the previous section. Trainers will engage participants to link the problems of youth unemployment and social exclusion through interactive activities. They will encourage participants to transform these problems into a solution, going through the social entrepreneurship principals with experiential methods. Trainers will also support participants to create their own strategic plan.

The MCAST trains and prepares youths and adults in a wide range of specialised skills in order to provide the bulk of the manpower needed by the local industry on a national level. \r\nIt is therefore crucial in the current global scenario for the MCAST to keep its VET system constantly updated by exposing and training its students and staff in other countries and beyond the national VET scenario. In itself the project acts as an essential cross-fertilisation project for VET education across the EU. \r\nThe main activities associated with the participation in this project will include: \r\n1) In line with the MCAST Internationalisation Strategy (Annex 1), the participation of the MCAST in this Erasmus+ project will give learners a unique enhancement to their educational experiences as they will have the opportunity of going on traineeships in companies and vocational education institutions in other European countries.  This is especially important within the context of a globalised economy: the students are presented with the opportunity of training in the international employment market. This project would offer over 120 students the opportunity to do an international VET learner traineeship in a company or vocational college and giving them the chance to apply the knowledge they learnt at the College, to learn new practical skills from their placements but also to be able to learn about a different European country and its culture. On successful completion of the mobility, a Europass Mobility Certificate will be issued to each participant in recognition of the experience gained. \r\nFor each of its six different institutes, the MCAST has identified a number of potential partners which will host students in companies, organisations or colleges abroad. These partnerships and their links to the different institutes and areas of studies are summarised in the attached Annex 2.  The expected learning outcomes for the students going on an Erasmus+ traineeship are: \r\na. to get work experience in their specific sector\r\nb. to recognise the main challenges in the sector\r\nc. to perform tasks independently & in a team\r\nd. to use standard tools & accessories in the specific sector\r\ne. to appreciate the main differences between the local market & the European market\r\nf. to appreciate different people, languages & cultures\r\nThe MCAST will also send students from the  Centre for Maritime Studies (CMS) on VET mobilities which last 6 months. These students will conduct practical training on board ships. This is fundamental for the students to acquire their profession as maritime officer. The Erasmus+ program will also offer OLS support to these students who often have to work on vessels to improve on their language skills.\r\nOne of the major changes in the scope of the mobility flows is the substantial increase in mobilities of learners and staff in the Netherlands. For 2017 and 2018 the MCAST, in line with its European Internationalization Strategy, desires to increase the number of VET learner traineeships in vocational institutes in colleges based in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands. In 2018 both Valletta and Leeuwarden will be cultural capitals of Europe. The MCAST has initiated several collaborative projects with the colleges of ROC Friese Poort , Nordwin  and Friesland for 2018. The MCAST desires to send 40 learners to carry out a traineeship in these vocational colleges in the Netherlands to work on collaborative projects. These collaborative projects will not only give an exposure to students in their area of study but will foster a cultural exchange between two European countries.  Students from all of the MCAST institutes, including: creative arts, sciences, engineering, business, ICT and community services will be eligible to apply. These Dutch colleges have strong ties with local industries and can give a good exposure to MCAST Technical College students in the respective industries.\r\n2)  Staff; For MCAST staff to stay updated and relevant in today's educational system it is crucial that the staff is regularly trained and kept abreast with technological advancement. Through this project the staff would be given an opportunity to receive a 5-day training in other vocational schools besides the opportunity to observe new areas of study, new technologies, new teaching methods etc. This will be a cross-fertilisation exercise across VET institutions. The mobilities will be in line with the MCAST training needs (Annex 3).\r\n3) Students and staff with special needs will have an equal opportunity to apply and participate in this project.
