The background to my taking part in this project is that I would like to ensure that the language experiences of the learners across our learning community continue to be positive and engaging. Therefore I have developed a two year strategy to build sustainable links with schools in Spain, which will be implemented through my departmental improvement plans, on my return to my department in August. This strategy will ensure that my participation in this mobility project has had maximum impact on both pupils and staff. It will allow pupils, from both our own school and our prospective partner schools, to use the languages they are being taught in a real life context and thereby increase their awareness of their identity as European and Global Citizens. In order for me to lead my department in this project I would like to improve my Spanish language skills so that I will be able to communicate effectively with our partner schools in Spain, as identified through the Etwinning Portal, therefore I have provisionally booked my place on the LFEE Immersion Course. \r\n\r\nWhile participating in this course I will also have the opportunity to communicate with my European counterparts in Spanish; this will allow me to improve the fluency of my language and to discuss new pedagogical practices and share the good practice of my own department. I will be able to create a network of contacts and as a result may look to creating a page via social networks to ensure that we continue to engage in professional discussion and can plan further mobility projects to the benefit of learners across Europe. \r\n\r\nAll experiences and information received while participating in this mobility project will be shared within my own learning community, St. Thomas Aquinas Secondary School and our six feeder primary schools, and across the authority in Glasgow. \r\nThe longer term impact of my participation in this mobility project will be included in my departmental improvement plan for sessions 2015-16 and 2016-17. As part of our school\u2019s commitment to self-evaluation all stakeholders will be consulted to ensure that my follow up strategy has the intended impact on all staff and pupils. This information will be included in my departmental Standards and Quality Report at the end of each year.", "http://www.st-thomasaquinas-sec.glasgow.sch.uk", "St.Thomas Aquinas Secondary", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012926_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G14"}
