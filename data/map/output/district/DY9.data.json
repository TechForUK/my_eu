CONTEXT\r\nEurope is the most visited destination in the World: it attracts 609 million international arrivals each year, that is 51% of global tourism.\r\nThe sector is important for the economic recovery: it is a driver of youth employment, creating more than 9 million workplaces in Europe (it creates 100 thousand new workplaces each year), its GDP represents 5% of industry and 7% of related economies, it involves 1.8 million enterprises and related economies create more than 20 million workplaces. Tourism is also an important driver for Italian economy: it is one of the most visited destinations in the world (WTO 2016).\r\nTherefore, it is important to invest in the sector and in professionals that support youth employment. Investment should assure that training corresponds to labour market request of competences.\r\n\r\nB. OBJECTIVES \r\n130 learners will qualify their competences with a 2 months training in a sector enterprise in BE, BG, DE, EL,\u00a0ES, IR, MT, PL, PT, UK.\r\nThanks to the project, learners will acquire knowledge for working in: food service industry, hotels industry and travel agencies, filling out the gap between formal education and non-formal one. They will improve language skills and increase intercultural dialogue.\r\n\r\nC. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\r\nActivities are divided into 3 Macro-phases:\r\n1. Motilities\u2019 preparation (11/2017 > 05/2018 e 11/ 2018 > 05/2019):\r\na. Partnership coordination;\r\nb. Enrolment and selection of participants;\r\nc. Participants preparation;\r\nd. Management and organisation support to the whole project\r\n2. Motilities\u2019 implementation:\r\na. European mobility for students - 60 days (05-09/2018 e 05-09/2019):\r\nTraining in enterprises; language and cultural tuition course for those students travelling to a country whose language is not supplied by OLS system.\r\nb. Monitoring and tutoring (05-09/2018 e 05-09/2019);\r\nc. Training experience evaluation (09-10/2018 e 09-10/2019);\r\nd. Acquired competences evaluation (10-11/2018 e 10/2019)\r\n3. Cross-sectional activities (24 months):\r\na. Administrative and financial evaluation;\r\nb. Dissemination and follow-up.\r\n\r\nE. METHODOLOGY\r\nBufalini will manage and coordinate the project together with MUP.\r\nTraining plan in hosting enterprises will be organised in accordance with ECVET procedure: Units of Learning Outcomes (ULOs), with activities and Learning Outcomes (LOs) (knowledge, skills and competences). Bufalini has prepared Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), signed by all European partners. In line with MoU, ECVET-Las will be elaborated. At the end of training period, hosting tutors will evaluate LOs achievement of learners. Final evaluation will follow. Registers, daily signed by tutor and learners, will show the number of daily hours training. Once having reports, applicant will start procedures for having Europass Mobility Certificates validated in Italy. \r\nBefore departure, all learners will register at OLS and go through the evaluation test. During the whole stay abroad, they will attend the language course of language spoken in the hosting country. At the end, they will go through the final examination that will certify them the CEFR language level achieved.\r\nEach 14 days tutors and trainees will fulfil monitoring questionnaires. Online system for exchange of documents will be created (accessible through username and password). Skype calls will follow for a face-to-face monitoring.\r\n\r\nF. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF RESULTS\r\nLeaning outcomes are expressed in terms of knowledge, skills and competences. Learners, who have carried out at least 80% of training and have succeeded, will receive the Europass Mobility Certificate, where LOs are validated. \r\n\r\nG. IMPACT\r\nThe project will involve:\r\n- 12 VET in 5 Italian regions;\r\n- 130 students and/or graduated (less than 1 year);\r\n- 27 transnational partners in 10 European countries (BE, BG, DE, EL,\u00a0ES, IR, MT, PL, PT, UK);\r\n- participation of students with fewer opportunities will be enhanced (1 person per VET)\r\n\r\nH. LONG TERM BENEFITS\r\nExpected project impact will be: local, regional, national and European:\r\n- enhanced youth employability in sustainable tourism;\r\n- enhanced tourism offer quality in Italy and Europe, thanks to creation of European and national networks;\r\n- improved quality for training system.\r\nDissemination plan will enlarge project impact, improving sustainability and highlighting European added value.\r\n\r\nAt 3 and 6 months after returning to Italy, learners will be monitored:\r\n- graduated learners: in order to evaluate their labour market inclusion or Higher education studies;\r\n- 4th year students: in order to evaluate potential improvements of school performances after Erasmus+ mobility experience.", "http://www.edulinkeurope.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-006003_7"], ["8TB", "Extended Learning and Teaching Opportunities in Italy", "Edulink Europe CIC", 34549.0, "The project has been developed in response to the growing challenge of youth unemployment in the UK, providing each participant with an opportunity to develop their professional skills, knowledge and competences in a real work setting in Italy which relates specifically to their Employability qualification within the level 2 employability unit as well as being relevant to the specific vocational qualification that they will be working towards.   This learner mobility project  is also targeted at those who are either currently studying on a VET course at one of the 4 institutions or are in the first year after completion of vocational qualifications from NVQ Level 3 to Level 6 (undergraduate degree level) in each of the four sending organisations, Keele University, Dudley College, The University of Wolverhampton or Stourbridge College.  The project will contribute to the regeneration of the local economy by helping to provide the trained workforce that is needed in most of the region's industry sectors, and in particular business, computers and marketing, fashion, travel and tourism, hospitality and catering and Environmental Sustainability.  \r\n\r\nThe 15 Participants will undertake a planned and structured Mobility  which will be monitored according to Ecvet. It will last a duration of 6 weeks. \r\n\r\nThis Project addresses the Aims of Key Action 1, by providing links to mobility, for young adults, and Apprentices, helping develop individual strengths and entrepreneurial skills, whilst providing enriched vocational and life skills learning. This Project will lead to the outcome of increased employability prospects for all participants. The Project will focus on advanced skills in tourism, leisure and hospitality, business, catering and hospitality and fashion design. \r\n\r\nThis Project offers students the opportunity to undertake a work placement in Italy, one of the top five most visited Countries in the World., with close to 50m Tourists in 2014 and growing. With an estimated value of almost 190bn Euros, it is easy to see that Tourism is one of the highest wealth creation sectors for Italy, boasting more World Heritage sites than any other Country around the Globe.   The selected areas of Italy will include Tuscany, Umbria, and the Veneto area, where participants will gain valuable work experience, so adding considerable value to their CV. and subsequent employability opportunities.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the mobility, students are supported to develop an individual Learning Agreement and a set of learning outcomes, which are shaped by the job description that they will be given by their placement.

All these actions are based on the awareness of the importance of pursuing the value of multiculturalism, of belonging to Europe, of responsible participation. The five-week 95 mobility projects for learners will take place in summer 2018, as scheduled in the project,  Poland, the Check Republic, Estonia will be confirmed as destination countries as the job internships offered have a great high- tech value. The UK, Germany, Spain and France will also be confirmed, as they offer  some excellent job internships in companies providing  indirect services to businesses. \r\nAlthough the students who study French are not so many, France will be confirmed as a destination  country in order to cherish the interest in the country shown by the students in  the last two years. \r\nSome of  the 6 two-week scholarships for the staff will be done in 2017, to continue the positive experience of  the first year. Thanks to the experience done by the staff in September 2016, an interschool  CLIL Team has been created at ITCG Pasini. \r\nThe leading school, Pasini, has created a CLIL project that includes the other schools of the consortium and a local Liceo Scientifico (a High School for Science and Maths). The project was one of the two winners (D.D. Miur 1433-22/12/16-Azione A2) in a competition promoted by the Italian Ministry for Education and Research (MIUR d.m.663/2016-art.29). It aims at creating innovative E-CLIL learning laboratories with the use of ICT. \r\nThis very important result has a great impact on the whole mobility project and it encourages the schools to promote the mobility of the staff and to foster the activities of language training for teachers (with an increase of + 20% of language certifications next year). \r\nThe language certifications (B1-B2-C1) of the students will increase too (+ 13%), this result will be reached thanks to promotion inside the schools, an increase of the number of language courses, school grants  for the certification exams (whose total amount has been so far  paid for by the students\u2019 families), the participation to the call of the Regione Veneto MOVE 4.0 POR-FSE for language studies abroad which  aims at making the students get the language certification. \r\nIn order to reinforce and improve language skills, the schools will promote activities with mother tongue teachers (115 hours), one language assistant of the project EduChange will be involved, language study holidays during the summer and school trips abroad will be organized, the project Smarter English will be implemented (a week of full immersion in the English language with activities held by mother tongue teachers for about 150 students). \r\nThe internationalization strategy  will be pursued with activities organized with local and foreign partners, through actions taken by each school:  Exchange Program with two German VET Schools (Marzotto e De Pretto with about 25 incoming students and 25 outcoming students); short training periods for 10 Polish students (at Marzotto and Chilesotti)  Erasmus+ VET coming from the foreign partner who is a host partner in this project too; in case the projects, submitted in the different countries, will be approved some mechatronics students coming from (BG and CZ ) will do a short period of training at De Pretto, and others  of  a textile course from Brno-CZ will do the same at Marzotto. The activities to promote Intercultura will continue; three students have already left for the USA where they will be staying for a year, however no prevision of this type of mobility is possible. The schools in Schio will continue to take part in the activities for the Exchange Program promoted by the Municipality of Schio with Landshut, German partner of the consortium. Other activities in English will be organized with local partners: conferences on international topics (\u201cIndustry 4.0\u201d and \u201cSharing Economy\u201d) held in English by Federmanager,   addressed to students of the fourth and fifth year, a whole day to promote work-training during the school period (ASL)  will be addressed to students of the third year, during this day all the activities will be in English. The event to promote European projects and let people know about them and the results  achieved, is being organized on the Europe Day 2018.

The experienced \u201cbest practices\u201d, acquired within a European perspective, will be integrated in our educational, organizational and internationalization school areas.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS / DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES: being inclusion a transversal issue, 16 teachers from all disciplines will be selected and trained before, during and after the mobility abroad; they will have to follow preparatory training sessions and workshops, to produce digital outputs and to become peer-tutors once back to school.\r\n 8 teachers over 15 will possibly belong to a sample 1st grade class (in order to better see the advantages of an integrated, cooperative action over the same group of students, from the 1st to the 5th year). \r\nOnce approved the project,  an eTwinning class and an Edmodo Platform will be created, offering the selected teachers the following online courses: English (10 hours), Inclusion (10 hours), SEN (10 hours); even the hosting partner will have to create a digital learning platform. Other 10 hour face to face course of spoken engish and a geeral course of incusion will be compulsory\r\n\r\nAs final outputs, all teachers will be asked to produce:\r\n-  innovative Lesson Plans (by using the free online software \u201cThe Learning Designer\u201d) which will be subjected to peer-review/self-\r\n   assessment activities and which will become part of dissemination plan to spread among colleagues and curriculum \r\n- an e-Hanbook,to be dsseminated as example of good practices\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES: In line with the NESET report, 2016, our project aims at improving the SEN students access and school performances by reaching:\r\n\r\nSHORT TERM OBJECTIVES\r\n- Avoiding segregation and promoting diversity in schools\r\n- Developing a new culturally relevant curriculum and culturally-responsive pedagogies\r\n- Creating a set of outputs to be exploited in the curriculum\r\n-  Recognising the importance of empathy and social-emotional learning\r\n- Using interactive participatory teaching methods\r\n- Promoting home-school partnerships\r\n\r\nLONG TERM OBJECTIVES will be tackled over the 3 years after the project ending:\r\n- Gathering practical and cost-effective examples of networking and collaboration in classrooms, schools and local communities \r\n- Ensuring effective school leadership and professional trust/visibility\r\n- Developing a community based on peer-tutoring practices\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n- Peer learning activities (PLAs):  peer coaching, peer learning and peer review\r\n- job shadowing and observation of good practices\r\n- face-to-face lessons / seminars and workshops with self-reflection activities on teaching-learning dynamics in the field of inclusion \r\n  (both before and during the mobility)\r\n- team-building and team-working\r\n- best practice case-studies\r\n- project working\r\n- practical laboratories\r\n- meetings with local NGO\u2019s which are active in the field of social and economical inclusion\r\n- focus-groups\r\n- daily evaluation through self and group assessment\r\n\r\nRESULTS/IMPACT: all activities aim at developing a culturally responsive curriculum and pedagogy,in order not only to reduce prejudice and discrimination against marginalised people(including women, people of colour and people with disabilities) but also to improve academic achievement.  Thanks to their experiences abroad, our teachers should come back with a more inclusive consciousness and attitude to be applied in their everyday school practices: they will become tutors themselves,active agents starting up a more systemic and inclusive education by sharing their teaching and methodologies with all colleagues\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONG TERM BENEFITS: Expected benefits on target groups will be the involvement in dialogue and ethnic mixing, where inter-cultural cooperation and tolerance will be fostered: SEN students will benefit from a more inclusive environment, with long term achievements such as social inclusion and reduction in school drop (which is strictly linked to social emargination); non SEN students will benefit from becoming active members of mixed backgrounds where prejudice is reduced and positive intercultural relationships are promoted.", "http://www.edulinkeurope.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047753_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DY9"}
