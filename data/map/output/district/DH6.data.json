Such a network forms the infrastructural basis to promote awareness of specific working practices of RECs across Europe, to enhance the shared knowledge base of European RECs, to support coherent reviews and opinions and to meet new challenges and emerging ethical issues. The central objective of EURECNET as a Coordinating Action is to foster the already existing network of European REC networks (in short \u201cEUREC\u201d). In particular, the contribution of EURECNET aims at five different levels: - fostering a sustainable infrastructure for European RECs (including a statute and a secretariat) to promote exchange and cooperation and to allow for international cooperation; - gathering information on RECs in Europe to build a basis for mutual exchange - collecting and evaluating training materials for REC members to enhance the quality of review; - conducting capacity building to facilitate the development of national REC networks (as future partners of EUREC); - identifying emerging ethical issues to develop common solutions for challenges posed by new technologies and scientific methodologies.", 7178.0, 759809.0, "EURECNET", "A stronger base for ethical research", "An EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) Coordinating Action has helped to strengthen the work of EUREC, a network of organisations and bodies relevant to ethical research.", "The project 'European research ethics committees' network' (http://www.eurecnet.org (EURECNET)) worked to foster a sustainable infrastructure for European research ethics committees (RECs). In support of promoting exchange, cooperation, reviews and network development, the primary objectives covered five main areas: infrastructure, information gathering, training materials, capacity building and emerging ethical issues.\n\nProject efforts and deliverables succeeded in strengthening links between European RECs. One of these is the website, which acts as a common information portal that has become a virtual meeting point for REC members Europe-wide. Additionally, a permanent EUREC Secretariat was established to monitor developments and coordinate EUREC work.\n\nOther work involved exchanging information regarding national legal backgrounds and structures of European RECs, as well as exchanging experience with training programmes for REC members. Furthermore, EURECNET identified new partners to continue the European networking process \u2014 an important aspect of capacity building.\n\nA regular electronic newsletter was distributed during the project to inform about the proceedings, and a print newsletter helped raise awareness for EUREC. Results, proceedings, events and relevant news are also available on the website.\n\nEURECNET also made progress with regard to the drafting process of a 'Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC'. This was accomplished through dialogue in conjunction with the European Commission and relevant bodies.\n\nExpanding the network of European RECs, EURECNET contributed to consolidating and strengthening the base for ethical review of research in science and technology.

Similarly, environmental education has become a global priority and the European Union has established climate change control and sustainable energy development as two of their goals for 2020. At the Escola Bressol Municipal Bal\u00e0fia, due to our absolute coincidence with these goals, we have carried out a needs analysis in order to find out how to reach our goal of updating and internationalizing our school and develop a culture based on environmental values and sustainability. In order to outline a plan of future development for our educational project, we have formulated a training plan for teachers named \u2018Get out and enjoy as you learn\u2019, thus motivating teachers to embrace a change that promotes health, wellness and teachers\u2019 professional development. Our project consists of a language course, necessary to develop foreign language skills and increase the school internationalization, and a course to learn the theoretical foundations and methodological principles of the methodology known as \u2018Outdoor learning\u2019, based on the use of natural spaces as learning resources and successfully implemented in different European countries. Theoretical courses will provide the theoretical foundations that will help us develop our school development plan. We have also planned the visit to two European schools which are successfully implementing this methodology in the early stages of education in order to observe their practical implementation of the methodology and learn how to apply in practice the previously acquired theoretical knowledge. The two schools we aim to visit are an English eco-school (Bowburn Infant and Nursery School) that has received European awards for their approach linking nature and education and their promotion of environmental awareness among children, and a Norwegian school (Kulturparken FUS barnehage as) that has been using nature and cultural institutions as regular learning spaces. Four teachers from the Escola Bressol Municipal Bal\u00e0fia (out of a total of 17) will take part in this project with the specific aim to develop expertise in this methodology, in the acquisition of linguistic competence and the commitment to creating a new plan of school development and disseminating the results obtained in the project.\r\nThe results obtained with the project \u2018Get out and enjoy as you learn\u2019 will serve as the basis for a new School Educational Project that will include the following actions: the gradual implementation of the new methodology; a new design of the school playground transforming it into an outdoor learning space; the use of the school vegetable garden as a source of organic products for children; the elaboration of a project aimed at conducting more outdoor activities and actively engaging local cultural institutions in contributing to the education of the school children and increasing the desire to learn; the future organization of bilingual groups that promote the learning a foreign language from the very first educational stage; and the elaboration of a plan of dissemination of results and acquired knowledge and competencies, including talks, seminars, open door activities\u2026 Our experience implementing all these measures will benefit the 17 schools in the local network of municipal kindergartens as well as other schools and institutions in the region.", "http://www.bowburn-inf.durham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-014031_2"], ["5BE", "Pedagogu profesion\u0101lo kompeten\u010du stiprin\u0101\u0161ana -  pirmsskolas izgl\u012bt\u012bbas iest\u0101des ilgtsp\u0113j\u012bgai izaugsmei 2016-2018", "Bowburn Infant and Nursery School", 6280.0, "Project background of project and objectives for Priekulu pirmsskolas izglitibas iestade \" Mezmalina \" qualitative development in the period from 2014 - 2020 , the planned activities that allow the preschool to create a potential for added value and contribute to the program \" ET 2020 \" overall objectives.

For the past few years, coding and teaching robots have also been present in school curricula from kindergarten to college. In order to give an international dimension to existing projects based on ICT, coding and robots, French schools in Priority Education, an English school in a former mining basin and a popular school in southern Italy decided to In an innovative Erasmus + K2 project.\r\nThe elementary school Marcel Plaisant (205 pupils, 14 teachers) and the Victor Hugo college (650 pupils, 60 teachers) are located in a popular district of the city of Bourges, in a very disadvantaged socio-educational and numerical context. Many students are failing or have significant difficulties in learning basic skills. Bowburn Elementary School (140 pupils, 20 teachers) seeks to develop the social and civic skills of its pupils in a popular social context as well as coding and robotics (Arduino). The Italian school of A. Gatto (1,200 pupils, 120 teachers) is particularly invested in ICT, coding and robots (Lego Mindstorm EV3) and Erasmus projects.\r\nIn order to remedy the shortcomings of schooling and avoid dropping out, French schools have set up a number of special measures (TACIT 2.0, additional master, decompartmentalisation, exchange of services, etc.). With computing equipment in full development, teachers use ICT in the classroom, especially to build innovative and motivating sessions. In the past few years, and with an Erasmus + K1 project, French teachers have also sought to develop collaborative projects based on ICT: cartoons, photo-stories, videos, newspapers or digital reports, digital literary criticism, Applications (Greenscreen, Yakit, etc.). These collaborative projects, also developed in the European institutions involved in the project, allow students to reinvest, to work differently the skills of basic knowledge with the support of ICT.\r\nThe eTwinning platform enabled the directors and / or teachers responsible for Erasmus projects to realize that the programming and use of educational robots made it possible to complete the training of pupils (basic knowledge) and above all to aim for high level skills such as collaboration, creativity and autonomy. An Erasmus + K2 partnership would pool, share knowledge and skills, collaborate on ICT, coding and robots. This innovative project at the local level would allow schools to take an international dimension, which would greatly enhance the dissemination and impact of learning.\r\nThis project is established in conjunction with partner institutions for 3 years. Training modules in coding, program exchange, challenge-coding and digital publications are planned throughout the project. The mobilities will be the opportunity to collaborate around different types of robots and programming languages in order to move a robot in a 3D environment created by the students. Ultimately, this partnership should improve high-level skills, validate the common core (mathematics, science, living and mother tongue) and the social and civic competences of the pupils.\r\nFollow-up committees in each institution, transnational meetings, a timetable with the modalities and contents of exchanges between institutions are already built. Models of training and analysis grids will also be shared between schools.\r\nDuring this Erasmus + K2 project, students will use a different language of their mother tongue (English, for example) to communicate and collaborate. In addition, this partnership project will open all participants and parents to other school cultures and practices during the mobility phases of training. The skills and professional know-how will then be disseminated during the numerous trainings and meetings between trainers in order to perpetuate the achievements of this Erasmus + K2 project. Finally, school blogs, institutional websites and eTwinning platforms will make it possible to disseminate this project of partnership and exchange of innovative professional practices.", "http://www.bowburn-inf.durham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA219-037224_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DH6"}
