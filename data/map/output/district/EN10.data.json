According to the research conducted by the European Comission, released in 2014, HE students, who had participated in an exchange program aborad had more chances obtain a work placement and they we less likely to be unemployed after graduating. This analogy can be applied also to VET education. \r\n\r\nExchange periods in a foreign country enhance the students' self-imposed abilites in independent work and an entrepreneur-like way of working, they, furthermore, give a larger perspective in working life, enlarge networks and improve students' language skills. Abilities to work in a multicultural environment get better, since the experience abroad enhances the students' self confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help to recognise their own strengths and weaknesses. This ensures better employment and helps in reaching our college's vision, which is to educate competent professionals of ICT and business and administration to the needs of the Helsinki metropolitan area. \r\n\r\nWith this mobility project we want to ensure a possibility to experience internationality also for the students, who need more encouragement and support in their studies. A period aborad can be a life-changing experience, which opens the student's horizons to new possibilities that he/she did was not aware of before. Apart from our students of business and administration we also want to focus on our students of ICT in order to improve their graduation and empower them. Our task is to ensure they will continue to work after graduation or continue in further education. We also take into consideration the new curricula that include even longer on-the-job learning periods. That is also one of the reasons, we are applying for more funding. \r\n\r\nWith the help of our foreign partners we want to learn new practices and pedagogical models. In the modern working life a project-like way of working is ever more common and that is why we want to develop a model of project learning in our education, which we already have to some extent carried out with the Scrum model for project learning in ICT teaching, where the students form project groups and they work independently while the teacher mainly coaches them in probelmatic situations, but the learning is mostly spontaneous. We will seek to improve our collaboration in the field of project learningf with our new project parter from Ludwigshafen, Germany and on-the-job learning periods in the field of game industry with our Irish partner BCFE. \r\n\r\nThe students have normally two on-the-job learning periods during their studies, the first lasts 10 weeks and the second longer, in most cases one semester. We send our students for their exchange periods for 6 weeks, which suits better our German partners, who mostly offer teaching in the dual model. We will agree on the time frame with the partners well in advance. The partner school offers support for the student during the on-the-job learning period aborad, if needed. The teacher responsible for the on-the-job learning period keeps in contact with the student and the work place. The teacher visits the work places for councelling and on-the-job evaluation. During the same time the teacher can get to acquainted with other work places depending on how many students there are to visit. The aim is to demonstrate and evaluate the students' skills in the work place abroad in most cases as per the ECVET model. \r\n\r\nOur staff has the possibility to participate on a job shadowing -period in a partner school. During the period they will follow a foreign colleague's work, such as guidance, teaching, work life cooperation and student administration and they discuss about different practices. Teachers can, if possible, combine their job shadowing trip to an on-the-job evaluation visit. The students will benefit from the staff's job shadowing periods indirectly as the new methods will inspire the students and the school staff will have a more positive outlook on internationality and they will encourage students to go abroad, too.\r\n\r\nThe college's aim is to increase international activities as per the strategy. The project will increase reciprocity and further develop both the sending and the receiving organisation. After the period the participants will write a report, which will be used in dissemination both inside the college and externally. Teachers and experts will tell about ideas on how to improve our activities. Blogs written by our students while abroad will be tagged to the school's website and on social media. In this way we will promote all international activities and improve our brand as an international college. We will also disseminate our international activities to pupils on 9. grade in comprehensive schools and enlarge our target groups.", "http://www.hrc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008891_3"], ["6GD", "LET'S DREAM BIG", "Renegade Talent", 16609.0, "This project is a bilateral exchange by an informal group of young people Renegade Talent  from London UK and a public body from Spain Xunta de Galicia. Each group consists of 20 young people aged between 18 and 30 years old and two youth leaders (1 man and 1 woman).The students involved in the project are young students, unemployed young people, young people looking for their first job coming from disadvantaged background.The groups will stay in London where most of the activities will take place.The theme that we will discuss is: Entrepreneur and entrepreneurship education in relation to different opportunities in culture, art and entertainment sectors in relation to the wealth of the territory. We will open a Chanel where young UK can find jobs in Spain and young Spanish in UK.The objectives are the stimulation of entrepreneurship, the enhancement of our knowledge in the field of art and culture and appreciation of the wealth of our territory .Thanks to the methodology of non-formal and informal learning English young people will share their know -how with that of the Spanish partners and this information exchange will be also done for general information .The project will have a strong impact on the territory, especially in the months ahead its realization. This will be due to the new approach those participants will have toward work or towards continue their training and then start their own businesses bringing prestige to the territory where they live .Other important aspect it that the Spanish will improve their English language and all young people will improve their computer skills, and social networks and social media, on the enhancement of their skills and the territory in which they live .The activities that will develop during the project are: working groups meetings, assessment activities throughout the project, play groups, working groups , meetings with cultural associations, meetings with local institutions, the working group for dissemination of results.", null, "Renegade Talent", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024695_coordinator"], ["6AE", "Broaden your World", "Hertford Regional College", 98894.0, "The importance of competences obtained from the international mobility period is increasing in the current employment markets. The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. \r\n\r\nStudents have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project we broaden our partner network so that we can provide even more opportunities for our students and personnel to get acquainted with different cultures, working cultures and education systems. We have new partner schools or organizations in Italy, Poland, Malta and Sweden.  We will be offering the possibility of participating in international mobility for a larger target group as well, as we include also students and staff of Adult learning and recently graduated students.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. \r\n\r\nStaff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy. This project increases the reciprocal co-operation and develops both the sending and the receiving VET institution. After the mobility periods, participants will write a report which will be used with the future international co-operation and dissemination both inside and outside of the organization. Teachers will share their development ideas also at the feedback and evaluation discussion. Student blogs and travel reports will be published at our public website to strengthen the visibility of our international activities and our image.", "http://www.hrc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA102-034402_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EN10"}
