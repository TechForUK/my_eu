The H2OCEAN consortium aims at developing an innovative design for an economically and environmentally sustainable multi-use open-sea platform. The H2OCEAN platform will harvest wind and wave power, using part of the energy on-site for multiple applications \u2013 including a multi-trophic aquaculture farm, and convert on-site the excess energy into hydrogen that can be stored and shipped to shore as green energy carrier. The project builds on already on-going R&D and commercial activities of a partnership involving European leading industrial and academic partners from 5 countries within the fields of renewable energy, fish farming, hydrogen generation, maritime transports and related research disciplines. The unique feature of the H2OCEAN concept, besides the integration of different activities into a shared multi-use platform, lies in the novel approach for the transmission of offshore-generated renewable electrical energy through hydrogen. This concept allows effective transport and storage the energy decoupling energy production and consumption, thus avoiding the grid imbalance problem inherent to current offshore renewable energy systems. Additionally, this concept also circumvents the need for a cable transmission system which takes up a significant investment share for offshore energy generation infrastructures, increasing the price of energy.

Non-European mussel suppliers are advancing in the European market with low-cost products, pushing the overall prices for mussel products down. The market price for live mussels has improved recently. This opens for widening the market for European mussel producers. European mussel producers are mainly located in rural areas. To allow them to benefit from their shorter distance to the European market than non-European competitors, the infrastructure must be improved. A significant cost to the European mussel sector is associated with the waste of mussels due to substandard quality. On average, 20% is wasted in the chain from producer to processer. The waste is mainly related to the current suboptimal practices in grading, handling, storage and transportation. The proposed MusselsAlive project seeks to increase the profitability and the competiveness for the large number of SMEs in the European mussel industry. The aim is to reduce the amount of commodity that is wasted from harvest to market by 35%. This represents a 7 % increase output (20.000 tons) from the mussel production for the EEA live market. This will be achieved by: (I) improve grading technology that reduce the amount of wasted mussels in the grading process by 35%; (II) develop a storage/transportation unit that minimizes handling and reduce the damaged and waste of commodity by 35%; (III) develop mussel holding recirculation system for conditioning and storage of mussels. The system will reduce the waste of commodity during storage by 35%: (IV) identify and prepare best practice protocols for grading process, handling, transportation, conditioning and storage of live mussels.

These factors contribute to variations in cell properties and differentiation potential which impact on the efficacy of cell culture. More worryingly these factors are potential avenues for the introduction of unknown or known pathogens with the capacity to infect transplant recipients thereby becoming communicable to the general population. Especially concerning is the opportunity for transmission of potentially lethal diseases across vertebrate species for which there are no known cures. The propensity of primitive stem cell populations to spontaneously differentiate is an added challenge which generally necessitates cumbersome manipulation of cells by skilled operators involving daily assessment, media replenishment and or cell passaging by physical dissociation. Realising the promise of stem cells and their derivatives for clinical and industrial applications therefore requires the evolution of new paradigms for cell culture which maximise chemical definition, minimise the involvement of skilled operators, and offer non-invasive modulation of cells by biocompatible means. The aim of this proposal is to discover and integrate with established and new cell culture technology, synthetic and non-vertebrate derived purified molecules with a capacity to mimic the functional properties of crude biological reagents currently used to control the behaviour of embryonic and adult stem cells, most notably affecting self-renewal, pluripotency, lineage specification and stability following cryopreservation.

Current research in algal biotechnology mostly focuses on metabolite discovery, aquaculture yield improvement and engineering bottlenecks. However, agronomical experience shows that controlling the interaction of land crops with mutualistic or pathogenic microbes is most critical to successful production. Likewise, controlling the microbial flora associated with algae (the 'algal microbiome') is emerging as the biggest biological challenge for their increased usage. Bacteria can control the morphogenesis of algae, while others are indispensable to algal survival. Pathogens are causing devastating diseases, the impact of which worsens with the intensification of aquaculture practices. Thus, the overarching aim of ALFF is to train 15 ESRs (researchers and technologists) within a multinational consortium, whilst bringing a scientific step-change in our understanding of these interactions, leading to the development of superior mass algal cultivation and biocontrol strategies. ALFF tackles: 1) the identification, taxonomy and utilisation of naturally-occurring algal symbionts and pathogens; 2) inter- and intra-species signalling and chemical ecology in aquaculture, natural environment and simplified systems (i.e. axenic cultures \\/- symbionts); 3) and harnesses state of the art genomics, molecular, and biochemical techniques to characterise these interactions. A highly interdisciplinary team underpins an ambitious theoretical, field, hands-on training and research program.
