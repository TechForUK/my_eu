These tools will be integrated with multiple state-of-the-art irrigation technologies and strategies as well as newly adapted devices leading to further increased water productivity. The flexibility, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, minimal maintenance of the system and often, increases in crop yield, will boost its acceptance and up-take by the end-users (the farmers, extension workers). In addition, as added value the system will enable reduction of fertilizer use, further supporting sustainable use of natural resources and adaptation of agricultural practice to climate change. To achieve this, the FIGARO project will develop a holistic and structured precision irrigation platform which will offer farmers flexible, crop-tailored irrigation scheduling protocols for their specific fields taking into account spatial variability management.", 60545.0, 6385288.0, "FIGARO", "Irrigation goes hi-tech", "Agriculture uses enormous amounts of water.

The aim of the project is the implementation of an irrigation management platform based on newly developed precision technologies. Field testing is now underway in Bulgaria, Denmark, Greece, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of existing software and hardware tools are integrated into the FIGARO platform to provide a farm-level decision support system for growers, technicians and water managers. The prototype platform components include a sophisticated decision support programme, a crop growth model, plant and soil sensors, data from satellite analysis and forecasting algorithms.\n\nThe platform structure is designed to integrate any type of sensing technique and management model, allowing it to expand its functions. Therefore, the platform can utilise models' sensing systems and networks calibrated to local conditions. Upcoming technologies such as robotic and mechatronic sensors can also be easily integrated into the platform.\n\nEnvironmental and crop growth data are collected and fed into state-of-the-art agronomic models while cross checking data from a variety of sources. The result is accurate, precise and reliable recommendations for how and when farmers should irrigate their crops.\n\nFIGARO gives policymakers an effective tool for monitoring and managing agricultural practices like irrigation, fertiliser application, and the use of saline or brackish water. The platform therefore allows decision makers to administer natural resources such as water and energy more effectively.\n\nFood industry companies buying agricultural produce grown using the FIGARO system will reduce their environmental impacts. It will also be easier for them to comply with environmental regulations. They will also be able to use the label stating 'Environmentally friendly farming practices used in our products lowered water footprint'.\n\nThe platform's flexibility, ease of use and minimal maintenance will help to ensure its widespread uptake and use by end users.

In general, NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability as a primary concern and deliver increased availability and fault-tolerance at a cost of temporary inconsistency and reduced durability of data. To balance the requirements for data consistency and availability, organisations increasingly migrate towards hybrid data persistence architectures comprising both relational and NoSQL databases. The consensus is that this trend will only become stronger in the future; critical data will continue to be stored in ACID (predominately relational) databases while non-critical data will be progressively migrated to high-availability NoSQL databases. Moreover, as the volume and the value of natural language content constantly grows, built-in support for sophisticated text processing in data persistence architectures is increasingly becoming essential.\n\nThe aim of TYPHON is to provide a methodology and an integrated technical offering for designing, developing, querying and evolving scalable architectures for persistence, analytics and monitoring of large volumes of hybrid (relational, graph-based, document-based, natural language etc.) data.

It motivates, entertains and highly influences our mood. Various researches have also shown the benefits of Music in the teaching-learning process, as it was already posed by Plato or Aristotle, one of the forerunners of integral music education. Today, the influence of Music on people\u2019s mood and health is getting more and more reckoned as musical therapy is spreading. Due to the tight link between Music and Emotions, the suitable use of such resource might contribute to a positive emotional environment within the classroom, which would be ideal for learning purposes.\r\n\r\nOur school is a Secondary school which runs a project on bilingualism. Therefore, we feel the need to innovate our methodology as well as to improve the linguistic competences of part of our teachers. So, we suggest here analysing the use of Music as a methodological tool for the learning-teaching of English oral expression.\r\n\r\nOur main aims in this project are to integrate Music as a methodological resource in the school as well as to improve the oral skills of both pupils and teachers so that the communication in the classroom improves itself, and to strengthen our project on bilingualism. The use of new technologies as a means to reach our aims above and the study on body language as a tool in TFL through Music will be sought. All this will be done to eventually gain the growth of the school and the cultural dimension of an integrated Europe.\r\n\r\nNine teachers from four different departments will take part in the project. Two of them will follow courses on methodology, four teachers will participate in job shadowing in experienced schools and two teachers will take English courses to enable them reach competence enough to join the bilingual project. After the training process, the members in the project will eventually put the acquired knowledge into practice through the subjects they teach. Among other activities, didactic units will be developed, which will deal with the suprasegmental features in English through music. They will be put in practice on teachers first, then on pupils. A series of activities and a repertoire of songs \u2013the bases to work on both musical and linguistic grounds, will be collected. Also, two choreographies with a medley of songs as musical base will be developed. Finally, a comparative study on pronunciation will be rendered based on the audio sample and free software as a tool.\r\n\r\nAmong the long run benefits, the inclusion of music in daily life at school will help the teachers and pupils enjoy such a motivating and attractive element as part of several subjects. The departments will include such methodological principles in their plans and they will enjoy both the material and the methodological resources produced within the project. It will help the school bilingual project to consolidate and spread thanks to the participation of new coming teachers, which will result in the enhancing of the quality in education.

About five hundred years later the colonies disappeared. Scientists still do not know exactly, whether they abandoned Greenland or starved. Nevertheless some elements that led to the end of the settlements can be understood by analysing remaining objects: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORESTATION: The early settlers cut down the forest not knowing that regeneration would take longer than in Scandinavia, as a result wood became a scarce resource, \r\n\r\nMARGINALISATION: Trade relations with Norway decreased, because after the Crusades cheaper sources of ivory were available in Africa compared to the walruses hunted in Greenland,\r\n\r\nCLIMATE CHANGE: Climate change led to the late and unpredictable arrival of seals, an essential source of food as stocks declined at the end of winter,\r\n\r\nCONFLICTS: To create social cohesion the Vikings separated themselves from the Inuit and thus could not draw on Inuit traditional environmental knowledge. They were also involved in conflicts that reduced the labour force of the Vikings to a critical level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of these causes can be compared to contemporary environmental risks. Therefore evaluating the end of the Vikings in Greenland may provide an inspiring example to discuss issues of sustainability. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE: In the 14th and 15th century all over the North Atlantic, the Vikings adjusted their lifestyles but still it was impossible to survive on Greenland. Today we might slow down climate change, but it is already certain that the rise in temperatures will demand adjustments (e.g. town planning) and will result in climate refugees. \r\n\r\nTRADE RELATIONS: As trade shifted to the South and East the settlements became marginalized, a threat Europe fears today when the focus of the global economy shifts to the Pacific region. But also the question arises of how to deal with least developed countries, which are largely excluded from international trade. \r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES: The Vikings in the vulnerable settlements in Greenland developed law codes, while contemporary issues such as overfishing and unsustainable logging of wood, especially in the rainforest, are unsolved problems and demand regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interdiscilinary project team of Wissenschaftsladen Bonn (D), Center for Design, Innovation and Sustainable Transistion (DK), BAOBAB (AU), Faculty of Education of Edge Hill University (UK) and Projektagentur Andreas Joppich (D) supported by the Danish National Museum and the Danish History Teachers Association will develop workshop material based on the research about the Viking settlements in Greenland. Children can explore the artefacts found by researchers in the ancient settlements and apply scientific methods of analysis to interpret what has led to their end. Newspaper articles allow the students to compare their findings to modern issues of sustainability and draw conclusions for lifestyles and policy making. Their ideas for environmental policies are compared to European environmental policies, so that the students can understand regulations and participate in political decision-making. \r\n\r\nThe resource materials, which can be provided by the partner organisations but also lent to schools for the application in lessons of history and geography, includes reconstructed artefacts, maps, guidebooks on research methods, newspaper articles, maps and data sets on contemporary issues, along with guidelines for comparing the findings to modern times. An outdoor setting offers the children a more adventurous experience as the items may be hidden and have to be discovererd first. Some outdoor games are used to create an adventurous atmosphere and stimulate the cooperation of the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workshop provides an example of how competence-centred education can be put into practice and therefore supports the efforts of the European Union and national governments to replace knowledge-centred practices in schools. To support this goal, the project partners also formulate a survey based recommendation on learning through inquiry and its benefits for the development of competences, especially learning to learn and scientific approaches but also social and civic competences, language and mathematics. Based on the experience, guidelines for learning through inquiry are produced, integrated into the manual, and transferred to a concept for train-the-trainer seminars. An instruction for self-assessment in the manual will make teachers aware of the learning impact on students and allows a promotion of learning through inquiry even after the project has ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the method supports interdisciplinary teaching and thereby more cooperation in schools.

Key objectives are to:\r\n(1) develop a recognised standard, curriculum, course and qualification that will give professionals an incentive to add to their knowledge and skills;\r\n(2) stimulate demand for and increase the uptake of innovation through stakeholder engagement and co-creation of course development ;\r\n(3) provide the opportunity to continuously update the curricula and standards by linking the professionals to a strong knowledge cluster.\r\n\r\nStrategic relevance: Across Europe, quadruple helix partnerships are striving to scale up smart solutions to address the demographic challenge of an ageing population. But, successful scaling of innovative solutions especially for the elderly with long-term conditions remain patchy.  The difficulty in securing health and social care professionals\u2019 engagement to utilize, help people to use and accept the adoption of assistive living technologies is a key obstacle to supporting people to live independently for longer. Partly, this is due to the shortfall of training opportunities for practitioners in assistive living technologies along with the lack of a recognised qualification for competence in their suitability and use. As a result, awareness of what assistive living technologies are available, what they can do, when they are suitable, who could benefit from them and in what way remains low amongst front line health and care workers and their managers. Moreover,  at European level, it has been recognized that there is no standard nor consensus as to what should be taught. \r\n\r\nMethods and actions: The ALTAS project intends to plug this important gap. It will develop, test and evaluate ALTAS standards, curriculum and VET course that can provide health and social care professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence to utilise, deploy and recommend appropriate ALT devices, technologies and related services. It will also create an accreditation scheme that will be a key step on the road to a national and European- recognised accredited qualification.\r\n\r\nALTAS will be delivered in 3 phases: Design, Delivery and Evaluation. The design phase will define the standards, develop a curriculum and generate initial content for course delivery. Needs analysis and stakeholder engagement will support the development of the curriculum and alignment with specific cross-cultural and health and social care characteristics within each partner country and region will be a key principle. \r\n\r\nUsing an iterative learning methodology, the delivery phase will develop an assessment framework, build the training course with the trainers and pilot an eCourse in one region. This phase will also develop and deploy a toolkit to support training course implementation. The assessment framework will form the basis for an accredited qualification, planned to lead to European wide accreditation. In parallel the course and e-course, developed by ALTAS  training organisations, will be launched to VET trainers during a 5-day coaching session incorporating different modes of delivery. The course, once developed, will be deployed to 45 trainees each in UK, Spain, Norway and Denmark over 4 days during a 7 month period. In parallel, the eCourse will be deployed in one region to test the right balance for blended learning and assess the most suitable platforms for its deployment. The toolkit will be built on the project website.\r\n\r\nThe third phase will focus on evaluating the course and assessing its impact on the target group and external stakeholders. During this phase, the curriculum and course will also be tested in a Central and an Eastern European country with differing cultural and health and care system characteristics. A sustainability plan laying the foundations for the future of the project and its intellectual outputs will be delivered towards the end of the project.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and impact: The ALTAS project will deliver a fit-for-purpose standards and curriculum, assessment framework and course materials for  health and social care professionals. These deliverables will be supported by an eCourse, a course deployment toolkit and a comprehensive evaluation report.
