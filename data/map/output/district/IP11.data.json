A collective reflection allowed us to list all the projects linked to the following goal: to offer exposure to international experiences. Our project is included in the \u2018Plan de D\u00e9veloppement Europ\u00e9en\u2019 (European Development Plan), and more information can be found on this through our website.\r\n\r\nOur project concerns 52 students who are studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at in Catering, Administration or Health and Social Care. During their training, the students must undertake a 22-week internship. It is extremely gratifying for the students to have this opportunity to do a 4-week internship abroad. Our project is spread across 24 months. We will send a group of students during the 2018/2019 school year, and then another group the following year. Each group is made up of students from the three vocational fields above. To select the participants, we have established a very precise list of criteria.\r\n\r\nThe multiplicity of our partner countries pertains to the core value of our project. Our learners will be sent to Spain, Poland, Cyprus or England. However, England is only an option before the end of March 2019. Whilst abroad, the students will be supervised by the French teachers and/or by our partner organisations, depending on the host country. Some of our European partners will only be hosting organisations, others will be intermediary organisations and we will help them to find host organizations and another will be both a hosting and intermediary organization. Learning agreements will be previously negotiated with each partner. For this project our organisation will be both hosting organisation for Polish teachers and intermediary organisation for Spanish and Cypriot learners.\r\n\r\nThe steering committee is composed of teachers and administrative staff, each member providing their expertise. The committee is divided into 4 subcommittees; administrative, financial, influence, educational initiatives. To manage this project to its full potential, we have, amongst other things, put in place a steering committee; created a Retroplanning and a Dissemination Plan; approached partners in our region and in Europe; listed the inherent constraints of the project etc. \r\n\r\nMost of our objectives are linked to the three following themes:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Cultural Heritage/The Year of European Cultural Heritage \u2013 our objectives are; to bring Europe to our lyc\u00e9e; to discover one\u2019s local cultural heritage and the cultural heritage of a foreign country; make 2018 the Year of European Cultural Heritage; to develop amongst our students a sense of belonging to the European Union; to enable students to consider jobs abroad; to develop their open mindedness, their adaptability to new environments, their capacity to communicate and interact with others.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Teaching and learning foreign languages \u2013 our objectives are; to develop learning of foreign languages; to deepen their linguistic competences in preparation for their future careers; to encourage teachers from the sending organisation as well as our partner countries to share their teaching methods.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Regional extension and cooperation \u2013 our objectives are; to create a recruitment pool of qualified young people who have the capacity to respond to the expectations of regional, national and European businesses and therefore develop their employability; to reinforce cooperation between the world of education and the world of work; to create a network of partners (schools, businesses) and cooperate with them.\r\n\r\nThe expected results from this for our learners are that they will have more motivation to learn a foreign language, have completed a project in higher education, have more self-confidence, have local and European employability, have knowledge of local cultural heritage and also of their host country.\r\n\r\nThe results we anticipate for our lyc\u00e9e are to develop a network of local partners linked to our vocational fields, develop our cultural heritage, create a network of hosting organisations in Europe, to encourage teams of teachers to work together through managing a project, to promote our lyc\u00e9e and it\u2019s international exposure, to cooperate with other schools and share teaching methods.\r\n\r\nThis project will be a major advantage for the student\u2019s career as well as for the staff concerned. It will consequently be easier to find new partners and improve our teaching methods, as well as attract more students and teachers. Furthermore, it will reinforce our involvement in other European projects and enable us to be recognised as a partner source.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046628_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3SY", "HARWICH INTERNATIONAL PORT LIMITED", 76216.0, "Optimising the integration and interconnection of transport modes and enhancing interoperability (06.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_11801", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP11"}
