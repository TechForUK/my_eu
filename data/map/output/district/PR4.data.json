Fresh cut salads, fruit salads and deli salads were chosen as model food system. Food producers will be able to optimise their raw material selection, product formulation and processing steps virtually. The software estimates the effect of each production step on the safety (growth or survival of relevant pathogens) and shelf life (growth of specific spoilage organisms and/or formation of undesirable by-products) while considering quality (organoleptic characteristics and other quality parameters). The predictive and probabilistic models are based on existing data sets of bacterial growth and quality changes under various conditions generated during previous studies (where available) and data generated during the project. Users will also have the possibility to insert own data, e.g. initial bacterial contamination. The web-based software can be continuously expanded \u2013 even after project end - by inserting new data sets (e.g. other food products, different environmental conditions, etc.).\nFurthermore, the project aims not only to develop predictive and probabilistic models, but also to compile information about different processing techniques, product formulations (e.g. clean label), environmental conditions (e.g. modified atmosphere packaging) as well as hygiene, quality and safety management. These information sheets aim to educate food producers, as they should not only see the effect of different factors on shelf life and pathogen growth calculated by the models, but also understand why. This increased awareness is crucial in improving overall food safety and quality.

NIHL results in reduced productivity from lost work days, insurance claims and potential early retirement. Current EU legislation requires employers to provide suitable ear protection for workers exposed to high levels of noise, but worker compliance is often low as they perceive the use of hearing protection as impairing hearing capability. Thus a suitable alternative to existing ear protection is needed, allowing speech and alarms to be heard whilst significantly reducing other potentially harmful sound. In summary the PiezoSelEx device will: \u2022 Promote productivity due to easier communication \u2022 Reduce the risk of NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a more comfortable work environment \u2022 Reduce employee absenteeism due to increased wearer comfort and a reduction in NIHL \u2022 Contribute to a safer working environment as warning signals will be easier to hear. The use of piezo materials in this proposal has many advantages over prior art of high end earplugs. The novel use of \u2018piezo pairs\u2019 self-powers the earplug, thus eliminating the need for external electrical equipment as is required by all current piezo earplugs. Furthermore, the use of sets of piezo pairs not only enables the device to cancel out all noise above 75 dB (A), but also \u2018filter\u2019 out background noise except for sound frequencies associated with speech and warning signals. The use of piezo pairs removes the need for batteries, thus having positive environmental implications.

From here we can begin to build the basis for a genuine attitude of acceptance of intellectual, social and cultural diversity. As a school we find a growing presence of students with a different cultural, ethnic and linguistic background and we want this situation to be experienced by the entire educational community as an opportunity.\r\nWe believe that a significant improvement in relationship skills with others and with oneself will revert to a more effective learning environment and to the training of citizens capable of facing the moral european challenges.\r\nTo achieve this, and as we believe that the Erasmus + program can be fundamental in achieving these objectives, we have put forward a series of training courses and Job shadowings in the following countries, with which we have already agreed on the objectives and content Of these visits: Poland, France, United Kingdom and Portugal. A commission consisting of a member of the management team, the person in charge of the Erasmus + program and the coordinator of Plurilingualism, will carry out a selection process of these visits taking into account the charge of responsability in the centre (the leadership, multilingual coordinator, special languages tearchers and Primary bilingual teachers\u2026.) the working specific situation( definitive position in the school , provisional position or interim teacher),  the cycle to which they belong, the specific training and  previous experience in European Projects.

We also believe that courses and stays will not only have repercussions at the center but also at the local level.\r\nAmong the benefits we hope to achieve with the project, in addition to those already discussed, is the consolidation of the multilingual character of our center, opening us to cooperation and innovation processes together with other European countries through the knowledge of good practices.", "http://www.longton-st-oswalds.lancs.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-036196_3"], ["5EB", "Comment devenir un \u00e9co-citoyen europ\u00e9en \u00e9clair\u00e9, responsable et \u00e9panoui  ?", "St Oswalds Catholic Primary School", 58932.0, "The climate of the school would benefit from being at the same time more serene and inducing to promote the learning. Following a Comenius project that stimulated reflection at the level of our school district, the teaching team at La Gazelle set up a charter of values called \u201cSTAR\u201d. This was to answer a problematic issue: how to help the pupil to build himself as a European eco-citizen.\r\nThe arrival of our director made us want to deepen the reflection, to think about new tools and to identify new lines of action which aim at the well-being of the student in the school and his commitment in Eco-citizen actions. The desire to renew the experience of exchanging and pooling good practices and professional gestures with European colleagues around the values related to the attitudes and behaviors of students has naturally emerged.\r\nIn order to respond to our problems and to extend our Charter with new tools, it is now necessary to go to other European institutions to see what is being done there and to follow at the same time training courses at a European level to learn and exchange among teachers from different countries; to build the future European citizen, the one who will thus be more able to become a citizen of the world, this can not be done while remaining in the angle of view of our hexagon.\r\nWe therefore need to go on site, in small but sufficient teams (4 people) to observe other educational systems, other tools to work this school climate, and to welcome to share our own experience.
