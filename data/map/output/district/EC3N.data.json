In SMEs, meeting outcomes and the ability to act upon them, are of particular importance and may have crucial impact on the future of the company. It is vital that SMEs have the adequate tools to exploit the knowledge and decisions generated in meetings. However, recording meeting minutes is expensive in terms of human resources, and, minutes are rarely distributed properly or integrated into the company\u2019s knowledge base. This means key ideas are lost, decisions fail to be followed up and meetings have to be repeated. DocuMeet aims to develop an affordable automatic tool to overcome these hurdles.\nDocuMeet is a user-friendly SW/HW platform that will allow organisations to better manage their meetings, and to easily document, disseminate, search and implement the conclusions of each meeting. DocuMeet will automatically record, transcribe, summarise and document meetings, using a dedicated recording unit, advanced Automatic Speech Recognition technologies, speaker adaptation and a new summarisation paradigm.\nDocuMeet will support the complete life cycle of a meeting (preparation, invitation, execution, documentation and follow-up) as well as its integration in the organisation\u2019s knowledge base. Although various products in the market support transcription or meeting management, there is no comprehensive, reliable and affordable solution providing automatic meeting documentation.\nWhile the potential market for DocuMeet includes any organisation that holds meetings, the product will initially target meeting room providers and business centres.
