Most of them have never left this French Indian Ocean island and still live in the neighbourhood where they were born. The education level and social, intercultural skills are low. The project \u2018EMANCIPER EMPOWER Mayotte by the European mobility in VET\u2019 addresses an urgent and crucial need on the Mayotte territory: develop the employability of young people by encouraging the mobility of 22 participants who will work as a trainee in an enterprise based in London (UK) during 6 months. This mobility will allow them to enhance their professional skills by acquiring transferable skills that are relevant to their profession and other key skills (English language, social and intercultural skills). EMANCIPER targets Vocational Education Training (VET) students of DAESA training centre, the coordinating organisation. Around 4 500 VET and high Education students from Mayotte go in metropolis for studying. The school dropout of students who don\u2019t validate a training or diploma is very high (80%). Therefore, DAESA\u2019s team brings a very solid support to the learners all along the project (before, during and after the mobility) and organize a mobility training before the departure (logistics, language, intercultural learning). The 22 participants will be spread out in 3 groups over the duration of the project (24 months). ZI consultancy, the intermediary organization will act as the focal point at the local level during the mobility and the entry point with the host enterprises. The project impact is to develop young mobility in Mayotte and the number of EU applications. Indeed, DAESA is the only organization which has submitted an ERASMUS+ application. DAESA wishes to become an active and substantial actor in the international and European mobility for VET students. DAESA would like to create a platform giving support to project leaders for facilitating the submission of EU funding applications. Recently, Mayotte became an EU\u2019s outermost regions. For most of the citizens, the European idea is very abstract and unclear. EMANCIPER allows them to raise their curiosity towards EU citizenship and opportunities. A mobility forum will be organized for the general public and the institutional actors, especially the County Council of Mayotte who will act as the co-founder of the project.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047412_1"]]}}}}
