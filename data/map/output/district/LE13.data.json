The cost of fire damage to the EU is estimated at 100 billion Euros. Fire safety equipment such as fire alarms and emergency lighting is extremely effective at reducing the damage and cost associated with fires. Fire resistant cabling that transmits power and data are an essential part of fire safety systems. The global market for fire resistance cable is estimated at 3 billion Euros p.a., with Europe accounting for 1.4 billion Euros p.a. European SMEs are increasingly having to improve the fire resistance performance of their cables to ensure that they are able to achieve the specification of the Construction Products Directive (CPD). Current soft-skinned fire resistant cables consist of insulated copper wires with a metallic shield layer that is applied by wrapping metallised polymer films around the cables. As a result of this wrapping process, there is always a \u2018slot\u2019 that runs along the length of the cables where the metallised films are joined. These \u2018slots\u2019 are invariably the point of failure when the cables are subjected to fire. The proposed \u2018Fire Shield\u2019 project will develop an innovative flexible polymer processing industrial extrusion processing that will combine traditional extrusion technologies with the relatively new innovation of dynamic cold spraying to spray the shields directly on to the cables.

The cost of taking plant off-line inevitably means that the heat exchanger operates at significantly less than peak efficiency.  Our proposed solution is to develop an innovative projectile based on-line cleaning and injection system that will work under the required operating conditions to mitigate foulant build-up throughout the heat exchanger.

There are various measures taken to tackle the overloading of the mains, including predicting when these overloads occur and preparing back up power to cater for it, however, this solution would only help in minimising it. There will still be some cases of overloading especially due to the fluctuations of the demand on the mains. All the time, Power Grids must ensure that electricity supply precisely matches the continually changing demand from the vast amount of customers. Although most of the large changes in demand are predictable there are continuous smaller fluctuations which are essentially random. And there is also always the possibility that a sudden large fluctuation could occur at any time and the sudden increased demand can cause a power line or generating station to fail.

The major issue in the new Arsenic limit is the associated costs to the water treatment facilities.

The water treatment cost using conventional adsorbents ranges from 6.7-40 \u20ac/100m3 (assuming adsorption capacity 1-3gAs/kg and adsorbent cost 5-10\u20ac/kg). Consequently, the main disadvantage of the available conventional adsorbent treatment technologies for arsenic removal seems to be the high cost of adsorbents. Additionally, Arsenic residuals have varying toxicity and mobility; thus, they require further treatment prior to disposal, which increases the total cost.

In addition, the process is not applicable to NO in low concentrations and at ambient temperature. As NO2 is easily removed by water, catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 at a low temperature is a promising way of removing NO in flue gas without using ammonia.\nIn the ENSPIRIT project, the core research work will focus on the production of a pre-production prototype catalytic device for NO oxidation over Activated Carbon at ambient temperature. The catalytic device will be integrated into a system of combined devices for the removal of heat, moisture, Sulphur oxides, ultrafine particulate matter and Nitrogen oxides.

Reducing this will be important if Europe is to achieve ambitious emission reduction targets, reduce its excessive reliance on imported energy and the decrease costs to households and industry. The most effective way to decentralise energy production is to increase the amount of generation at source, in this case within the home. A common barrier to the adoption of most energy saving technologies is the high initial investment cost which results in long payback periods considering current energy prices. However, with prices on the rise, existing technologies such as solar thermal heating systems and heat pumps are becoming increasingly popular. Although both are reasonably efficient, existing solar thermal heating systems generally only provide up to 60% of a typical household\u2019s annual hot water demand. Air source heat pumps are more effective and can provide up to 100% of total household heating requirements but their performance decreases significantly in winter and they suffer from frost-build up. As these technologies are becoming commodity products, SME\u2019s in these markets are coming under increasing pressure from cheap and often unreliable imports from Asia.  It is therefore paramount that European SME\u2019s keep a technological edge over these competitors.

Many current products require permanent modification to the vehicle, or outside assistance to store the wheelchair elsewhere in the vehicle during transport. We will develop an innovative electro-mechanical system to carry the user and their wheelchair into the passenger seat space of a car through a complex, optimised path. Our system will allow wheelchair users to travel in a wider range of popular family cars than is currently available, and will impose no permanent modifications to the vehicle, drastically increasing the resale value of the car.", 11420.0, 1035550.0, 4, 6, "CARGO", null, "http://www.uk-heri.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/157473.jpg", "fp7_107649_999445806"], [1356998400000, 1419984000000, "\"A novel, integrated, wheelchair and hoist system\"", "The Uk Health & Environment Research Institute", "'The objective of the project is to produce a wheelchair with an integral hoist system.  This will allow for more independent living, a reduced need for lifting and manual handling from carers and a reduction in the number of costly disability aids within the home.\n\nThe Homehoist system will function initially as an everyday wheelchair, but will also be capable of lifting the user at certain positions within the home via the integrated hoist system rotate them through 180 degrees to the toilet, the shower, a sofa, or a bed.   This will incorporate a stabilisation system and optional floor clamps will ensure the system is can operate under more demanding load conditions. If others areas of the home need to be accessed the hoist section of Homehoist is able to be detached and used independently, this will also improve transportation of the device by breaking the system down into two lighter more compact units.\n\nAt Hi Tech Automation Limited we want to be sure that our business continues to develop.

The growth of the ice disturbs the local airflow and can radically alter the lift of the aerofoil and hence the handling characteristics of the aircraft. This phenomenon has caused a number of fatal accidents and loss of control events and is a problem that will intensify as increased pressures on airports mean that aircraft will spend much longer in low altitude holding patterns. Large aircraft use hot-gases diverted from the engines to remove ice from flight-critical surfaces, while smaller aircraft sometimes use pneumatic \u201cboots\u201d which expand under pressure to shed the ice layers. These technologies are incompatible with future generations of air transport, in which composite materials will be used extensively. Furthermore, current ice detectors are insensitive, cannot distinguish between ice types and are not co-located with the safety critical zones. Building on electro-thermal de-icing technology now widely used in helicopters, the ON-WINGS  project will develop a smart, autonomous, composite electro-thermal de-icing system for fixed wing, helicopter rotor blade and engine inlet applications.
