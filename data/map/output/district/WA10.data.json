Youngsters of today live in a time of religious , political and social unrest.  Mass immigration, refugees and terrorism fills the news and we are facing a time of prejudice towards people of other nationalities and religions. In this projects the youngsters take the opportunity to work together on an artproject and meanwhile get to know themselves and youngsters of other cultures better. A contemporary art exposition (named \"ME, YOU, US\", developed by Rasa) is used as a starting point for this international reflection and exchange about who we are, what influences and construct our identity and how we interact with the other(s).This exchange program is initiated by Destelheide in close partnership with Carmell College of United Kingdom and ZTPM Brezice from Slovenia . The youngsters of all three organisations want to develop and expand their knowledge of other cultures and other art forms. They want to gain a developed understanding in their own identities and in that of the other peers in the project using their own artistic talents.  The rationale of this international exchange project is to create an artistic space where young people can exchange thoughts and ideas about the theme  'identity' in interaction with other cultures. Before this international youth exchangeweek in Destelheide all youngsters in the different organisations are preparing the theme through a mobile app (in English) which is provided by Rasa. This mobile app can be seen as an interactive learning tool and an introduction on the exposition.  This inspires the youngsters to work with  some conceptual ideas and different artpieces about Identity.  (there is an advanced planning visit for the youthworkers to introduce them to the exposition and the mobile app.)The exhibition \u2018ME, YOU, US\u2019  is showed during the exchange week in Destelheide. The youngsters  prepare and present a workshopactivity in their own art discipline to the other participants. By extension we are organising different workshops with professional artists and freelance workers  to open the philosopical discussions about the theme and help the participants to get an insight in this intercultural learning proces. At the end all youngsters will work together to an artistic product/presentation about identity. We will create  a non formal \"learning\" exchange where the young people have the opportunity to question themselves, each other and their view of the wider world. We formulate 3 objectives through this project: 1. focus on intercultural dialogue and intercultural awareness. 2.  peer education in artistic and creative ways of thinking 3. competence development.We expect that the exposition, the app and the arts will show different  artistic and creative ways of thinking about their own identity and will help the young people to question themselves in this emotionally difficult conversation. In the end we hope the youngsters get a good view on each others (sub)culture and way of living in different European citys. We hope to increase the young people's positive awareness of other cultures and themselves. They will get a broader insight on identity, more self-awareness and self-confidence and a better understanding of one another, as an inevitable step to tolerance for the others and a general well-being. In this way we develop a sense of understanding of diversity and help to prevent and combat on an non-formal way  prejustice, rascism and all attitudes leading to exclusion.", "http://www.carmel.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE05-KA105-001892_2"], ["4NQ", "Opening the door to all things French", "Queen'sParkCE/URC Primary School", 31967.0, "Queen\u2019s Park is larger than the average-sized primary school.

In 2016 we were awarded full accreditation in the British council\u2019s International School Award. We have 7 partner schools (2 in France, 1 in Australia, China, Tanzania, Germany and Italy).\r\n\r\nAs a school, we are proud of our international activities and our staff are enthusiastic and committed to furthering this. However, in terms of language teaching, we only have one member of staff who is confident enough to teach French, so she is currently responsible for all French lessons across the school. We recognise that this is an ineffective strategy which limits our pupils\u2019 exposure to French and means that we are unable to develop meaningful cross curricular links to reinforce their learning.\r\n\r\nWe need to embed French into our general teaching and school life so that pupils get regular opportunities to hear and practice the language. We want to immerse our pupils in a linguistic and cultural environment allowing them to see the relevance of language learning through making it part of our everyday routines. We also need to find meaningful ways to reinforce learning through linking different curriculum subjects and encouraging staff from different departments to work together, increasing the European dimension throughout the school.\r\n\r\nIt is a priority in our school to ensure that all our staff are equipped with the skills to perform their jobs to a high standard. As languages are now compulsory in primary schools, it is our school's duty to give all staff the chance to further their skills and enhance their future prospects.\r\n\r\nWe propose a two-year project which will include 17 of staff taking part in a short (three day) mobility to France and 21members of staff to take part in a longer, more intensive course (eight days) . The courses include immersion in language and culture, the opportunity to spend time in a French school, and (in the longer courses)intensive language teaching, teaching methodology, professional discussions on a range of relevant topics.\r\n\r\nOur first year mobilities will involve 24 staff travelling together at the start of 3 and 8 day courses, and we will take the remaining 14 mobilities in year 2.\r\n\r\nOur head and our MFL lead) will oversee the project as a whole and briefings will be given as regularly as necessary at the start of staff meetings.
