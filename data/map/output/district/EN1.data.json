The general objective is to explore novel and innovative (precompetitive) routes for transformation of natural gas to liquid products, particularly suited for remote areas to facilitate the transport. The aim is an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to develop in a long term vision the next-stage catalysts and related precompetitive technologies for gas to liquid conversion,  in fully consistence with the indications of the call. For this reason, we have excluded to consider as part of the project catalytic technologies, such as FT synthesis and hydrocracking. In addition, we have excluded to investigate coal to liquid, both due to environmental impact of the use of coal, and to focus R&D. We have thus focused the project on three cluster lines: 1.  new, not conventional routes for catalytic syngas formation from natural gas which include steps of separation by membrane and eventual reuse of byproducts; 2. direct catalytic conversion of methane to methanol/DME; 3. direct catalytic conversion of methane to aromatics under non-oxidative conditions followed by upgrading of the products by alkylation with ethane/propane.", 72700.0, 10388555.0, "NEXT-GTL", "Making better use of natural gas", "The conversion of natural gas to liquid fuel is a promising way to relieve dependence on decreasing fossil fuel reserves.

Scientists working on the EU-funded project 'Innovative catalytic technologies and materials for next gas to liquid processes' (NEXT-GTL) are addressing the main cost and technical challenges associated with conventional gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes.\n\nThey are exploring novel routes for catalytic syngas production from natural gas.

This exploits catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of natural gas together with gas separation membranes. Developed catalysts and membranes will be tested in a pilot plant facility for comparison with semi-commercial ones.\n\nEliminating the syngas production step is another promising route to decreased production costs of liquid transportable fuels, both gasoline and diesel. Scientists are exploring routes for direct, low-temperature catalytic conversion of methane into methanol with extensive investigation of suitable methane activation sites.\n\nIn addition, they are investigating direct catalytic conversion of methane to aromatics that can be upgraded (by chemically combining with ethane or propane in a so-called alkylation reaction). During the present reporting period, scientists have made important progress in novel active and stable catalyst development, both for aromatisation of methane and for benzene alkylation. They are also developing selectively permeable separation membranes to be used in both processes.\n\nNEXT-GTL is making important progress in developing novel cost-effective and efficient methods for catalytic conversion of methane to liquid fuels for the transportation sector.

The aim is to improve the ability of training organisations to deliver high quality and relevant adult digital skills training by developing guidance for adult educators on delivering digital skills, formulating digital competency frameworks as the basis for developing appropriate training programmes, producing learning materials and developing tools, techniques and methodologies for digital skills training. Within this overall aim, the project\u2019s concrete objectives are to:\r\n\r\n1. Formulate a digital competency frameworks for (a) adult educators and (b) adults\r\n2. Design and pilot a modular \u201cTrain the Trainer\u2019 course for adult educators, and Digital Skills course for adults.\r\n3. Develop blended training resources for the \u2018Train the Trainer\u2019 and Adult Digital Skills courses \r\n4. Improve adult educators\u2019 knowledge of learning technology platforms, tools, and skills in using them \r\n5. Produce guide for adult educators on strategies, tools and approaches for promoting and delivering digital skills training to adults.\r\n\r\nThe project was developed against a background and context of rapid digital transformation of the economy, which means that almost all jobs now require some level of digital skills, as does participation in society at large. Today, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), in their various forms, permeate our lives from early years. Furthermore, the use of ICT in our private lives for leisure purposes, entertainment and communication with other individuals has shown a dramatic increase. In the work place, these technologies have spread so rapidly that an estimated 90% of all available jobs require at least a basic level of digital skills. Almost half the EU population lack basic digital skills with 20% having none at all (New Skills Agenda).\r\n\r\nThe main target groups are adult educators delivering digital skills of which 6 organisations will develop increased capacity to deliver digital skills, 12 adult educators will improve their competences and at least 75 adults will improve their digital skills through the pilot training courses.\r\n\r\nThe main outputs of the project will be:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Country Analysis reports- A comparative analysis of the adult digital skills landscape in the participating countries\r\n\u2022 Digital Competency and curriculum frameworks for (a) adult learners and (b) adult educators\r\n\u2022 Courses in Digital skills for (a) adults and (b) adult educators\r\n\u2022 Leaning resources to support the blended delivery of the courses \r\n\u2022 A Handbook on delivering digital skills \r\n\r\nThe project will provide additional learning opportunities for adults and adult educators.

However, if they are to do so effectively, they themselves will need to be financially competent, as developing financially competent citizens requires financially competent educators. Yet, this area has received little attention in terms of policy, resources or initiatives to prepare and train financial educators.   \r\n\r\nAgainst this background, this project, Financial Education for Educators aims to build capacity in organisations providing financial education by empowering the organisations and their staff to deliver high quality training in financial and economic literacy.  Within this broad aim, the main objectives are to: \r\n1.. Provide a comparative analysis of the preparation of financial educators in Europe, North America and Australia to inform the future training and preparation of financial educators \r\n2. Formulate a financial and economic competence framework for educators \r\n3. Improve the financial and economic competences of at least 14 adult educators to deliver financial education to adults\r\n4. Provide opportunities for adult educators to improve and update their competence to deliver financial training though an e-course in financial and economic literacy. \r\n5. Create a course that could confer \u201ccertified financial educator\u201d status on successful completion.\r\n\r\nThis project will begin to address the issue of the preparation of financial educators by developing strategies, and tools and training programmes to help educators develop financial and economic competence so they can facilitate the development of adults\u2019 financial competence. Very importantly too, as the world of finance becomes more digital, financial educators will also need to develop and update both their financial and digital competencies, so there will need to access continuing professional development opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe project will produce the following Intellectual Outputs.\r\n\r\n1. A comparative analysis of the training and preparation of financial educators in Europe, USA and Australia\r\n2.
