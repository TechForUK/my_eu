The seminar is using a variety of workshops focussed on different aspects of social impact: the overall framework of European youth policy, the Erasmus+ programme, a diversity of instruments to measure educational and social impact and an exchange market to start-up future E+ projects.  Throughout the programme the participants will develop a format for a dissemination plan, which they will apply to disseminate the outcomes of this seminar.  Next to this we disseminate this format as a good practice into the wider European Youth work sector.\r\n\r\nThe direct impact of the seminar will be the increase capacity of the youth workers and project partners to develop qualitative educational projects for youth, which better meet the needs of their target groups.  The long-term impact for the partnership will be an increased number of project applications under E+.

Young people develop a vision of a future society that excludes no one. It\u2019s about a creating or increasing awareness of the importance of community, the need for the participation and the resultant opportunities for change. The participants will develop a definition of community based on the binding elements of young people from different cultural backgrounds and experiences. The main question is: \u201cWhat do we have and what can be our common model of community?\u201d\r\n\r\n2. Participants are encouraged to help shape the society and to identify ways of engagement. They develop for the group and for themselves ways of social commitment. This is a practical and project-related block in which we will try out how community can be established. \r\n\r\n3. The participants plan and organize a community-building project during the youth encounter celebration, with about 300 guests on 24th of January 2015.

The previous idea for the approach to the subject is the following: The participants sew together a tent. This tent is to be stitched together from different pieces of cloth with a typical pattern that brings each participant from his country. Under this all-encompassing, community symbolizing tent roof the participants organize a public activity which underlines the community and social commitment. A part of the tent roof and thus the idea of action will be carry back into the home projects to provide motivation and impetus for further activities and community-building projects in the sense developed by the participant\u2019s vision of the world in which they want to live in the future. In this way the ideas developed by the participants can be advanced in the home countries.

The education system in Sweden is acclaimed for being an example of best practice and therefore, it will benefit our school for our staff to be able to see what makes their practice so effective. \r\nThis course will assist us in achieving some of the aims of our School Improvement Plan for 2018-2020 which are:\r\n-To use rigorous monitoring and evaluation incorporating both support and challenge to further strengthen the teaching profile and to ensure that improved practice is reflected in students outcomes. \r\n-To continue to offer first-class CPD which is responsive to need and provides an unrelenting focus on key skills and targeted teaching with an additional focus on boys, disadvantaged, SEND and Most Able students. \r\nWith these key groups in mind, the opportunity to visit schools in different settings in Sweden will allow us to seek out examples of where each group succeeds and take that information to apply in our own setting where appropriate. \r\nThis course explores methodologies around outdoor learning, which will benefit our pupils with social and emotional needs by experiencing learning outside of the classroom. By addressing their needs in an outdoor setting, they will become more resilient and confident learners and this will then have a positive impact on their learning.  \r\nAnother of our objectives is:\r\n-To ensure that CPD opportunities are shared with partners beyond school to strengthen collaborative learning. \r\nAttending the course in Sweden will allow us to achieve this aim, and we will then seek to share our findings with other schools to support their development as well as our own. Sharples School currently hosts the Teaching and Learning Hub in Bolton, where the heads of Teaching and Learning of each school meets and discusses best practice. This would be the ideal place to share our findings. \r\nThe leadership aspect of this course will also aid our current programs in school. Our Teaching and Learning lead is currently running a program entitled 'Leadership: Growing from within' which aims to develop the leadership of current and aspiring middle leaders, not only in our school, but other local primaries. \r\nWe intend on sending our current senior and middle leaders on this course to reflect on their current practice and in the long-term, apply their learning to improve the leadership at our school.", "http://www.sharplesschool.co.uk", "Sharples School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047048_coordinator"], ["6PQ", "Volunteers for Solidarity", "Salesians of Don Bosco UK", 12843.0, "Voluneers for solidarity is a European Training course for young people focussing on the competence development of capacity building of the youthwork organisation. \r\nJeugddienst Don Bosco is the apllicant organization and will coordinate the project. We have a large experience in organizing, hosting, coordinationg European projects. Volunteers for Solidarity involves 8 Don Bosco youth work organizations specialized in youth work, long/short term volunteering and young people working with disadvantaged young people. 17 youth workers will be involved in this TC that\r\ntakes place in de waterman in Brussels (Molenbeek). The project will focus on different topics like human rights, human rights education, active citizenship, volunteering, social activism... . By exchanging, sharing, following workshops, reflecting, analyzing, deepen th eknowledge ... youthworkers will get a broader view on the topics of HR and active citizenship. We will use different methods like peer reflection, active reviwing, worksmethods from Compass, games   and debate, swot-analysis, creative workshops...to reach the objectives and results planned. The main objective is to improve the skills of the young people and the quality of youth work in the sending organizations. \r\nThe pax. should be beteen 18-30 years old and all had a long term volunteering experiencing in or outside Europe. This is relevant since we want to use their experience as a method to become active citizens in thier societies and their sending organizations. The projects aims well to involve young people with fewer opportuities since many sending organizations are working with these target groups and involving them as volunteers. \r\nThe trainers delivering the TC are all volunteers and trainers on national and international level. Hereforwe cooperate with Don Bosco Youth-net, the European network of Don Bosco Youthwork organizations. The selected trainers come from the DBYN pool of trainers and al have a large experience in working with volunteers, with the topic of Human rights and with active citizenship. \r\n.\r\nWe hope next to more active citizenship of the pax. that they will become human rights educators amongst peers and in their volunteering works and taht they will become 'activists' striving for a warmer society. \r\nThe intercultural aspect of this project is quite strong since 17 Europeanvolunteers/young people from 8 different countries are brought together in Belgium. The participants will learn from each other, live\r\nand work together intensely, develop new ideas and projects and motivate each othe rto take action in their local environments. Participating in this TC will trigger them to join in other European activities and/or maybe to organize a European/local project themselves.", "http://www.salesians.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-2-BE05-KA105-002494_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BL1"}
