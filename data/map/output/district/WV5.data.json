We want to increase the social protection as well as the chance of working effictively for all students in the classroom. Inclusion is a key word.  We want to increase the international cooperation and work with different schools in Europe. Our goal is to strengthen our language teaching by this cooperation.\r\n\r\n Needs: \r\nSurahammar is a small mill town in the county of V\u00e4stmanland. The community of Surahammar has aproximately 10000 inhabitants. The population has, until recently,  been rather homogenous , with inhabitants of Swedish or Finnish origin. In recent years the population has become more and more heterogenous, because of all refugees.\r\nIn many homes the parents are not used to studies and it can be hard to motivate our students to study at home. We need to observe schools that have succeeded in motivating their students to reach high results in spite the lack of support from the parents. We also want to influence our students\u2019 attitudes, so that it will be something positive to study and reach high results. The PISA results in Sweden are far below average and we would like to visit schools in countries that have succeeded far better than we have.  In this way we would like to learn from those countries and in the long run be able to avoid that students stay at home in stead of going to school . We think that this could prevent early school-leaving.\r\nWe also need to learn how to motivate our students to study languages and how they can succeed in their language studies. Our language teachers need contacts in the countries where they speak the languages that we teach, to be able to give our students the possibility to communicate for real. Furthermore our language teachers need to develop their own languages to be able to stay in touch with new influences in the languages that they teach.\r\n\r\nAims\r\nOur aims are to create a safe and friendly atmosphere for studies, where it would be permitted to succeed at school. We would like to include all the students in the classroom and thereby reach higher results in all subjects.\r\nWe would also like to reach higher results in foreign languages, through the education of our language teachers. Furthermore we want to broathen our teachers\u2019  and our students\u2019 horizons by enlightening  them about daily life in schools in other countries.\r\nAnother aim  is to start an ongoing cooperation with a number of schools in Europe, to be able to see how they work with these matters in other countries in Europe.\r\n\r\nResults and effects:\r\nBetter results in all subjects\r\nA safe and friendly atmosphere for studying, where all students are included.\r\nBetter results in foreign langauges.\r\nGet all students to school and prevent early school-leaving.\r\nA better understanding for the world around us.\r\nA continous cooperation with schools in Europe.\r\nA bigger European dimension in teaching, get Europe into the classroom.\r\n\r\nActivities 2015-2017\r\nJob-shadowing: 3 special needs teachers will study inclusion and how to create a quiet and friendly atmoshere in the classroom, in Finland, Poland and Germany. A maths/natural science teacher will study methods of the Maths teaching in the Netherlands. A Swedish/social studies teacher will study how to reach high reading comprehension, in Finland. Three language teachers will study how to teach languages in France, Germany and England. Our English teachers will take part in a course in Great Britain: \u201c Language, Life and Culture in the UK today\u201d\r\n\r\nDissimination:\r\nOur staff will update our progress on our internal website Schoolsoft, where they will write about their experiences so that the rest of the staff, our students and the students\u2019 parents can be informed about their accomplishments. The teachers who have taken part in job-shadowing will talk about their observations during our staff meetings, so that everybody can benefit from their experiences and so that we can make a plan for the future for our school.

Everything fits into the economic crisis coming out context that will shoot up the labor market demand and the specific skills required by employers.\r\n\r\nConsortium\u2019s schools are facing two major risks of the labor market:\r\n- The skill-mismatch between specific and transversal competencies of students that are coming out from the scholar training and labor market demanded skills\r\n- The mismatch between the demand and offer of occupation in the administrative and commercial sector.\r\n\r\nConsidering these criticalities, this consortium has defined the following objectives:\r\n- Strengthening student\u2019s motivation and orientation into labor market, through internships abroad;\r\n- Develop the recognition and validation of learners' Learning Outcomes with ECVET;\r\n- Projecting to the foreign, territorial limits of carrying out the training programs, in order to improve school-work combination\u2019s capacity and skills, as the recent Law 107/2015;\r\n- Promote students\u2019 personal growth through discussion and widening of cultural horizons, social and human rights;\r\n- Strengthen linguistic and multicultural skills of learners;\r\n- Provide a European awareness and education to internationalization to students and school staff;\r\n- Expanding labor market\u2019s knowledge, through a varied awareness, diverse and transnational;\r\n- Enhancing training quality, by identifying an inner linguistic competencies development plan, to include in training programs;\r\n- To develop, considering the large number of the consortium, a collective consciousness on practical work placements abroad, involving local and international companies, civil society, policy makers and public bodies;\r\n- Improve the ability to ensure internships abroad in a cohesive and efficient manner, sharing good practices, creating a complementary skills and contacts system, centralizing services related to the organization and management of mobility;\r\n- Strengthen transnational relations numbers and quality of this consortium, developing new contacts and new opportunities for cooperation.\r\n\r\nThe project will last 17 months (from 01/09 / 20167al 31/01/2019) and includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 80 students and 15 teachers per placement abroad, divided into five flows of 1 month each.\r\n2) Mobility of 20 Neo-graduates for internship abroad divided into four flows of three months each.\r\nAmong the students will be included at least 24 (30%) students with fewer opportunities and 10 students with special needs (DSA and BES).\r\n\r\nThe mobility will be organized in three periods (May 2018, June / July 2018 and September 2018). In the first two periods there will be two flows of students for each of them, in the last period there will be the mobility of the last flow of students and 4 flows of Neo-graduates.\r\nMobility\u2019s results will have an impact on a wide actors category:\r\n- Students, that will improve their transversal and professional competencies and will be more competitive on labor\u2019s market.\r\n- Staff, which will improve their competencies, being active member of school modernization, improving the didactics and finding new job\u2019s motivation;\r\n- Schools, which will modernize and internationalize their traing offer and will increase their validation and appeal.\r\n- Firms, which will satisfy their demand in terms of number and competencies.\r\n- Indirect beneficiaries, with dissemination activity, which will benefit by peers experience\r\n- Other stakeholders, that will benefit of new consortium competencies in terms of new relations and future projects.", "http://www.athwalresourcing.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005919_10"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WV5"}
