This idea of a higher status links not only to student engagement but to staff success. There is the need to make professional relationships with schools abroad in order to strengthen the professional profile of the teaching professions. In addition, a consistently high level of French and Spanish throughout the department will help encourage students to learn through the example the teachers set.\r\n\r\nA higher status of MFL in our school would also lead to an increase in engagement. It is the case that the more engaged the student, the higher their attainment. In addition, a boost in engagement can prevent some students from leaving school early and not taking the opportunity to continue into KS5. It is also really important to mention that the students at Cramlington react well to finding out about different cultures and learning new languages. In the north east, where language \u2013learning is not as popular as other areas of England, there has been a struggle to interest students in other places in the world. That said, at Cramlington, students are very curious and would respond very well to a more European influence. This in turn would raise attainment.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to send 2 members of staff on structured training courses in France/Spain over 1year. These members of staff plan to go more than once over this time, as there will be a continual need for professional development, following on from our experiences. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to send two members of staff, both already proficient in French and Spanish to France and Spain in order to develop their language skills and to observe different methodologies. These members of staff will then return with their knowledge and use it to implement it into Cramlington\u2019s curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe staff involved will have regular meetings (once every two weeks) to discuss the action plan and the areas we would like to focus in particular during our trip. For example, it will be interesting to see how Spanish/French education uses differentiation to ensure everybody in the class is supported and challenged. Another area of interest for us will be how language learning can be more engaging for the students. It will be an excellent opportunity to share ideas with other practitioners, familiarize with schools both France and Spain with the potential to establish a partnership for trips abroad or multi-international projects in which students can see the benefits of learning the language and apply it to a real context. Also, it will be a great incentive for both students and teachers to bring back in the classroom the atmosphere and the thrill of being abroad after a week of cultural immersion. \r\n\r\nAfter the trip, we will organize a presentation to the department during CPD, displays around the school so the students can develop curiosity about going abroad therefore study the language. The school also set up a eTwinning programme and SKYPE project with the schools abroad so students can know each other and keep the language alive.  \r\n\r\nThe impacts that will follow from taking part in the project are several such as: \r\n\u2022 Improvement of language competence\r\n\u2022 Increased confidence\r\n\u2022 improvement of teaching methods\r\n\u2022 motivation of pupils and staff\r\n        \u2022 increased inter-cultural understanding through better contact with native speakers\r\n\u2022 professional networks to improve teaching and attainment", "http://www.cramlingtonlv.co.uk", "Cramlington Learning Village", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002097_coordinator"], ["7RD", "Mobile aujourd\u2019hui pour \u00eatre employable demain", "Fergusons Transport Ltd", 18472.0, "Sophie Germain high school is the promoter of the Erasmus+ project 2014-2015 and will give the opportunity to 12 motivated students, willing to live an unusual experience, to go to England as a trainee. They are students preparing a baccalaureate exam (High School Leaving Certificate) in administration & management, sales and trade.\r\nWe do have 18 work placement possibilities  and more (see appendix 2: letters of intent, appendix 3: list of partners) thanks to the relationships we developed  throughout the six previous Leonardo projects. However, we chose to give this opportunity only to 12 participants which gives us the possibility to have six extra safe work placements in case of problems. \r\nAfter several months of training (see appendix 1: work plan), the students will go to England in January & February 2015.  \r\nThey will do a work placement linked to their vocational training during four weeks in the area of Whitley Bay and Newcastle. \r\nStudents in administration & management will be welcomed in companies such as OXFAM, North Tyneside Council or Tynemet College or international companies such as  Fuda or Ferguson Transports. \r\nSales and trade students will get the opportunity to improve their skills in charity shops such as Age UK, Barnardos, British Heart Foundation, Red Cross,  and shops such as FE Maughan and Marks and Spencer, the new partner in this Erasmus+ project. \r\nOur students will individually stay at selected host families in order to encourage relationships and improve their English.   \r\nMrs Christine Goodwin, the manager of Northumbria school of English, will be in charge of selecting host families, providing linguistic support, and organising one cultural activity each weekend. She has been involved in our mobility projects for four years. \r\nOn Tuesday afternoons the participants will meet Whitley Bay High School students during tuitions where they will attend linguistic and cultural supports. Whitley Bay High School teachers all agree that French students show a real interest in the English language and culture.  This could lead them to be more open-minded and dynamic. Our participants mobility could also offer future prospects to English students who are not willing to leave their country. It will enable us to organise exchanges and encourage mobility in both countries. Our vocational high school is located in Thionville, in the core of \"La Grande R\u00e9gion\" (Luxemburg, France and Germany). This location makes this experience relevant. Indeed, mobility with these three countries is a characteristic of local employment markets with the increasing number of border workers. This new application aims at securing this need to get interested in other farther European countries. One of our school project priorities is the mobility development. Moreover getting involved in such a project enables to meet the demand of the objectives of our European sections.  \r\nSuch a project offers obvious and important benefits for our students. This mobility is a profitable experience, useful and enriching their professional career. Discovering a new culture and improving language skills will develop autonomy, responsability,  and self-fulfillment.  Besides, a one-month work placement for our students, in an English company, will encourage the awareness of  European citizenship. Indeed very few students are unaware of this concept because they are not used to travelling. The impact of mobility on our students will help them to pass their examination more easily and to get the \"European\" Mention plus the \"Europass Mobility Certificate\". Thus, thanks to an improved C.V., their job search or future studies should be faced with less anxiety.  \r\nConsequently, they will be more likely to work on the European or international market.  This Erasmus+ project will make our Sophie Germain high school, the Region Lorraine and the European Union more attractive and enhance their values and fame. \r\nWe will try and share our experience and activities with the press and media, which hopefully should raise interest in other students to join the programme. \r\nTo put it in a nutshell, the educational systems have to upgrade and fit into the new ways of teaching and learning.

In Europe, according to the Emergency Database of Disasters (EMDAT), the number of natural disasters reported increased from 43 in 1974-1978 to 288 in 1999-2003. All the agencies working on monitoring climate change agree that, in the future, such consequences will intensify with the weather and temperatures being more extreme. Impacts will include natural disasters such as river floods, droughts, forest fires, warm periods, including heat waves, are expected to be more intense, more frequent and longer-lasting.

However, such impacts can be mitigated through the education of individuals, communities, and disaster responders on three levels: prevention, preparedness and response to natural disasters. Unfortunately, the European population lack the necessary education to face the changes brought upon them by climate change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to address the identified educational needs of the European population to face the changes brought upon them by climate change, fire and rescue services, primary and secondary education schools, adult education providers, and public administrations from six European countries will work together in this cross-sectoral and cross-border partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project \u201ce-learning for the prevention, preparedness and response to natural disasters\u201d aims to develop, validate and deploy a set of innovative educational materials to educate the European population on the prevention, preparedness and response to natural disasters related to climate change. These educational materials will be made into e-learning modules and available for free on an e-learning platform as OER (Open Educational Resources). There will be four e-learning modules: one for primary school children, one for secondary school students, one for adults including those from disadvantaged social groups (those with fewer opportunities, elderly and disabled people\u2026), and one for disaster responders (fire and rescue services, emergency personnel and other first responders). Each e-learning module will be tailored to the specific needs of its target group throughout a process of adaptation and validation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe execution of the project will last 24 months and is structured in the following phases: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 1: Development of the educational content for the e-learning modules\r\n\r\nThe professionals in prevention, preparedness and response to natural disasters represented by the four fire and rescue services from Denmark, Lithuania, Spain and United Kingdom will develop the educational content for the four e-learning modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 2: Adaptation of the educational content to the target group\r\n\r\nTeachers and trainers from primary and secondary schools, adult education centres, and VET providers will adapt the educational content of the e-learning modules to the specific needs of each target group. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 3: Translation of the e-learning modules\r\n\r\nProject partners from non-English speaking countries will translate the e-learning modules into their national language while the British project partner will improve the quality of the English version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 4: First deployment of the e-learning modules \r\n\r\nProject partners will deploy on the e-learning platform the four e-learning modules in six European languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 5: Validation of the e-learning modules \r\n\r\nThe e-learning modules will be validated by real users (primary school children, secondary school students, adults, and professionals from fire and rescue services) throughout six pilot tests.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASE 6: Final deployment of the e-learning modules\r\n\r\nBased on the feedback from the validation of the e-learning modules carried out during the pilot tests, project partners will apply the necessary improvements and will deploy the final version of the e-learning modules, accessible to all and for free in six European languages (Danish, English, Estonian, Lithuanian, Romanian and Spanish) on the e-learning platform as OER (Open Educational Resource). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the e-learning modules will be easily transferable to other countries and to other organisations, every user, teacher, trainer or education provider using the e-learning modules  will be a positive step towards the education of the European population and the disaster responders on the prevention, preparedness and response to natural disasters.", "http://www.northumberland.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA200-000763_5"], ["6BN", "The Outstanding New Teacher programme (ONTP)", "Cramlington Learning Village", 186321.0, "Newly qualified teachers have to be supported during the first years of their careers.

The partners of the project don\u2019t want to select one effective system but they want to develop several support measures and tools for school leaders and teachers so they can develop their own coherent system in the school, embedded in the existing structure and culture.  It is important to know that the support will focus on three dimensions: the professional (teacher competences and skills), the social (becoming a member of the school and professional community) and the personal (professional identity/profile). The last two have not often been subject for research. Critical success factors to create this kind of support will be indicated and roles of stakeholders defined.\r\n\r\nWe need to invest in the well-being and professional development of all teachers during the course of their career.
