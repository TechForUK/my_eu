We achieve this by equipping and building up young people to overcome all limitations imposed on them by social and educational disadvantage. Many of the kids here would be at risk of involvement in crime and anti-social behaviour, and so the aim is to provide them with a focus, a source of physical challenge and encouragement, and a place of safety amongst people who can provide them with positive examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolas Project began as a small after school club and over the past 5 years has developed into much more, reaching out to larger groups in the community. The project now plans to build on two previous sucessfull years of hosting EVS volunteers in the area. We have seen the impact these volunteers have had on the community, the children in the programme and also the impact their time in Ireland has had on their individual lives. The work the volunteers will be engaged in focuses on the development of community life in an area of Dublin which has a very poor social history and where many families struggle financially. There are many issues faced by the children in this area, but through this project they are encouraged, educated, provided nutritious meals and their sense of belonging and self esteem is increased dramatically. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to encourage and develop the individual volunteers as they join the existing staff team in providing support, education, nutrition and care for the children and teenagers of the Liberties area of Dublin city. The aim is to provide an inspiring place where volunteers and the local community can learn from each other, inspire each other and assist each other in areas of future development. We aim to bring great benefit to the volunteers through an exciting programme to equip them with a range of knowledge and skills that will benefit them in further learning or employment. Many of the skills they will develop whilst with us will be transferable to their chosen professions in the future. Spending time here will also help to increase their self confidence, independence and will increase their ability to tackle challenges of life. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolunteers: \r\n\r\nWe are looking to host a total of 3 volunteers, two female and one male. They should have an interest and passion to work within community development, youth work and education. They will need to be flexible in their work and willing to try new skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nVolunteers will assist in the following areas: \r\n\r\nThe Club: After School Programme. Tasks will include preparing and serving meals and snacks, assisting children with their homework, preparing and running various activities (including sports, arts/crafts, baking, games etc.), assisting in organising trips and outings.\r\n\r\nY Not: College awareness programme whose aim is to assist children in their final year of primary school inspiring them about the  possibility of attending college by running a classroom session with interactive discussion on \u2018why go to college\u2019 as well as bringing them on a guided tour of a college campus in the hope that this will assist in breaking down any preconceived barriers in attending third level education. \r\n\r\nStep Up: Secondary School Mentoring Programme \u2013 providing general support or working one on one with a student. This focused support allows young people to work on subjects they may be struggling with as well as helping them to develop organisational and study skills and work on their own personal development.\r\n\r\nSports:  Primary School Programme  -  preparing and implementing a tag rugby programme in eight local primary schools to include coaching the basics of rugby and teaching the \u201clife lesson\u201d for each session \u2013 preparing blitz at end of programme for each participating school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project:\r\n\r\nWorking with sending organisations we will identify and then support young adult volunteers during their placements. The placements will be run by Solas based on a successful and effective programme that has been working for the past 6 years. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the results and impact envisaged:\r\n\r\nThe project will have a significant impact as participants develop transferable skills that will benefit them in their work in Ireland but also in further education / professions. They will help to promote and share cultural awareness. The work the participants deliver will ensure increase participation and well-being as well as preparing children to be global citizens in the world around them.

After many decades of fragmentation in the western youth culture, a new focus is needed today bringing together and building bridges between youth on the one hand, and between young people and the local community on the other. It may be an answer to the inreasing polarisation endangering the values Europe has been built on (such as tolerance, brotherly love and religious freedom). Since young people are and will always be the trendsetters in any kind of new development, we hope that building bridges will become a trend to bind together for the sake of a better future and a better world. But a better world does not begin on Mars or in Brussels; it starts in our own local communities. So that is where the mission of Bridgebuilding needs to begin. And it will begin with young people. Because young people today are facing many challenges that seem impossible to overcome, we need the whole community to come together to support youth. There are many kinds of bridges to be built. Not just the youth who are most likely to succeed as they have the grades, the status and  the money, but also the young people who face the greater challenges of poverty and unemployment and whose future looks dim. \r\n\r\nThe youth culture today is not easily defined and understood.  Therefore youth work today requires effort, constant analysis and diligent discipline to work out the nuts and bolts on how to best lead and guide young people to be motivated, principled and caring citizens of this world and of Europe. With this in mind we are organising a training programme called the Youth Work Factory.\r\nFrom the region of SouthWestern part of the Netherlands where Atlantic Bridge finds its home, we want to build a strong network that not only reaches across Europe but also to North America. This is nothing less than an effort to improve the quality of youth work in our western world. \r\nBut we need to start small. We start by bringing together three people from seven different countries. We will train and guide these teams to build effective local work in their own local communities a whole year long. And we will support them in this process through the year.  We will evaluate the year with local exchanges and a final event in the summer of 2016. \r\n\r\nOur methodology is to create new small teams of youth (Bridgebuilders) focused on building bridges, They are armed with a curriculum to train them in this art and discipline. At the same time a regional team of adults, parents and friends is started in support of these teams and its youth leaders. As they learn the blessings of a global society they apply these acquired attitudes and skills to their local community setting, building positive communities focused on mutual respect, coorperation, faith, hope, peace and love. At these communities are impacted we plan for a growth of these teams locally and on a European scale. \r\n\r\nThe heart of this mission is about love, hope, faith and peace. These are the Christian values that help build a better world. But these values are challenged today with the increase of selfishness, greed, need for control etc. which are often at the heart of the increasing polarization today. Perhaps it is time that we return to the values that have built up Europe to what it is today, a continent in great demand by people from other continents to come to and live in!  A Europe of tolerance, individual dignity, brotherly love, equality and peace, values deeply rooted in Christianity. But young people today are losing these values as they lose their connection to their Christian heritage. And so we hope that the churches that are the guardians of these values across the last two millennia, will join our effort to build a revitalised positive youth work so needed in our world today.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2015-2-NL02-KA105-001030_1"], ["5RR", "Changing Lives: Service to Others and Self-Leadership", "Time For God", 94853.0, "The project \u201cChanging Lives: Service to Others and Self-Leadership\u201d has been developed by Time For God drawing on our 50 years of experience in international volunteering.

Volunteers at Lea Road URC and Morley Community Church Trust will be involved in a range of community activities which include working with youth groups, visiting the elderly and reaching out to disadvantaged groups. The projects at Church Army, Yeldall Christian Centres and Bethany Christian Trust all involve supporting people who are vulnerable through homelessness or recovering from addictions. All volunteers will be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants.

This is to see communities rejuvenated through education and sport. We achieve this by equipping and building up young people to overcome all limitations imposed on them by social and educational disadvantage. Many of the kids here would be at risk of involvement in crime and anti-social behaviour, and so the aim is to provide them with a focus, a source of physical challenge and encouragement, and a place of safety amongst people who can provide them with positive examples.Solas Project began as a small after school club and over the past 5 years has developed into much more, reaching out to larger groups in the community. The project now plans to build on two previous sucessfull years of hosting EVS volunteers in the area. We have seen the impact these volunteers have had on the community, the children in the programme and also the impact their time in Ireland has had on their individual lives. The work the volunteers will be engaged in focuses on the development of community life in an area of Dublin which has a very poor social history and where many families struggle financially. There are many issues faced by the children in this area, but through this project they are encouraged, educated, provided nutritious meals and their sense of belonging and self esteem is increased dramatically. Objectives:The objectives of the project are to encourage and develop the individual volunteers as they join the existing staff team in providing support, education, nutrition and care for the children and teenagers of the Liberties area of Dublin city. The aim is to provide an inspiring place where volunteers and the local community can learn from each other, inspire each other and assist each other in areas of future development. We aim to bring great benefit to the volunteers through an exciting programme to equip them with a range of knowledge and skills that will benefit them in further learning or employment. Many of the skills they will develop whilst with us will be transferable to their chosen professions in the future. Spending time here will also help to increase their self confidence, independence and will increase their ability to tackle challenges of life. Volunteers: We have recruited a total of 3 volunteers, two male and one female. They all have an interest and passion to work within community development, youth work and education. They will need to be flexible in their work and willing to try new skills. Description of activities:Volunteers will assist in the following areas: The Club: After School Programme. Tasks will include preparing and serving meals and snacks, assisting children with their homework, preparing and running various activities (including sports, arts/crafts, baking, games etc.), assisting in organising trips and outings.Y Not: College awareness programme whose aim is to assist children in their final year of primary school inspiring them about the  possibility of attending college by running a classroom session with interactive discussion on \u2018why go to college\u2019 as well as bringing them on a guided tour of a college campus in the hope that this will assist in breaking down any preconceived barriers in attending third level education. Step Up: Secondary School Mentoring Programme \u2013 providing general support or working one on one with a student. This focused support allows young people to work on subjects they may be struggling with as well as helping them to develop organisational and study skills and work on their own personal development.Sports:  Primary School Programme  -  preparing and implementing a tag rugby programme in eight local primary schools to include coaching the basics of rugby and teaching the \u201clife lesson\u201d for each session \u2013 preparing blitz at end of programme for each participating school. Methodology to be used in carrying out the project:Working with sending organisations we will identify and then support young adult volunteers during their placements. The placements will be run by Solas based on a successful and effective programme that has been working for the past 6 years. Description of the results and impact envisaged:The project will have a significant impact as participants develop transferable skills that will benefit them in their work in Ireland but also in further education / professions. They will help to promote and share cultural awareness. The work the participants deliver will ensure increase participation and well-being as well as preparing children to be global citizens in the world around them.

The goals of the projects are to offer meaningful utilization of free time of young people and to increase European awareness in different regions and social groups among young people in Slovakia. The duration of the project when the EVS volunteers are in our organization is 24 months. In the project the volunteers will have space to create and realise their own projects what will help in converging of Europe and their citizens.   \r\n\r\nNowadays - in the socialy isolated society - it is necessary for real people to meet real people, to meet them FACE to FACE. If we do not start to do and live this, then not only our country but the whole Europe will be conected with social networks but despite of this, it will be isolated. Therefore - we want the volunteer to come and be a good example for people in our cultural context\r\n- we want to deepen EU awareness with personal example. We see that during these personal times, there will be an exchange of information and experiences, looking for common values and during this the volunteer will learn a lot , create friendships, educate himself and change his / her attitudes and character. \r\n\r\nThe title of the project is YOUR LIFE AS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHERS\r\nWe see 3 reasons for realisation of this project\r\na) EVS as a positive example of service for others\r\nb) increasing of EU awarness \r\nc) elimination of social isolation \r\n\r\nThe project will be realized in three levels. \r\nThe first level is the local level (town P\u00fachov). There will be organised a conversation course for citizens of P\u00fachov and there will arise participation in local activities of the local community. These can happen through dialogues, games, songs, presentations, etc. This will be connected with realisation of international European meetings. \r\n\r\nThe second level is the regional level which involves the town P\u00fachov (20.000 citizens), village Z\u00e1rie\u010die (800 citizens), village Lazy pod Makytou (1.400), Pova\u017esk\u00e1 Bystrica (42.000 citizens) and others. Here will be concentration on cooperation on regional youth projects, sports, music and educational activities, as well as there will be the opportunity for volunteers to participate in the local activities in these towns and villages (depending on the skills of the volunteers). In these towns and villages there will be organised also some international European meetings that will increase European awareness and the programme Erazmus +. The volunteers will participate in realization of different youth meetings (many of them are in small villages) in the area from Myjava region to Martin region where they will inter alia present their EVS service. \r\n\r\nThe third level is the national level that includes for example projects Helping Hand (based on outdoor activities and experiencing of pedagogic supporting of a healthy life style) and Semfest (national youth open-air festival) where above mentioned focuses will be integrated in different ways.   \r\n\r\nThe third level is the national level that includes national projects like Helping Hand, Meet God, Semfest orSport olympiade, where there will be space to integrate above mentioned focuses.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK02-KA105-001309_3"], ["5RR", "Regional Youth Contact", "Time For God", 37776.0, "The Regional Youth Contact (RYC) is an activity and information platform through which youth from different cultures, religions/ church denominations and ethnic groups meet, become acquainted with each other and learn to appreciate each other as they participate in a variety of bridgebuilding activities. EVS volunteers help organize these activities and  participate in them; building bridges of friendship, faith and understanding and breaking down walls of prejudice, ignorance and indifference.\r\n\r\nThe RYC is a long-term individual 11 month EVS project during which we want to host five volunteers. Four Sending Organisations from Programme countries will be our partners. We will host two volunteers from Great Britain, one from Germany, one from France and one from Hungary. wo volunteers are positioned at the Atlantic Bridge center (The Vierslag), where they will assist in the running of a local youth club while also  helping with the facilities management of the center; administration, housekeeping, caring for guests, gardening, etc. Of the three remaining volunteers, two are positioned in the town of  Goes, the central town of the region of Beveland, and one is placed in the town of Middelharnis, the central town of the region of Goeree Overflakkee. In these towns and regions they will be involved in youth culture research projects, visiting youth clubs, build contacts with students, assist in language lessons, assist in leading a Bridgebuilders Club in school, doing presentations about their own culture and heritage, and promoting the activities of building bridges in the region. \r\n\r\nThe themes of the project are European Awareness, Youth work & participation, and Ethics, religion and philosophy (Inter-religious dialogue). The objective is building bridges across the many polarisations and walls in our world and in our communities close by. \r\nCentral to the success of the RYC is a local support network in the region where a RYC is established. Youth work becomes a community effort with various groups complementing each other and with a special role for the older generation to initiate and participate in building these bridges.\r\n\r\nThe potential long term benefit of this project is found in the building of exemplary positive communities of which young people need to be part as they are our future. Connecting them with each other, helping them find their personal, cultural and historic value will  establish a bridge to future generations as good experiences spread also back to their own countries and communities.

The main component of the project is the voluntary service, working for and with people on the edge of Dutch society (e.g. homeless people, (former) drug addicts, people, immigrants, mentally disabled people and children in disadvantaged neighbourhoods). \r\n\r\nAnother important component of the Amsterdam Voluntary Year is the intercultural exchange that takes place when living together (or spending a lot of time together) within an international community.\r\n\r\nTo support the Non Formal Learning process during their service, the volunteers are offered an extensive training & support programme.

Solas Project has a strong reputation both within the community and with partnering community organisations for building relationships with young people. The children which Solas Project supports have been identified as the most in need of a community which faces social and economic disadvantage. Afterschool clubs provide an opportunity for stability, nutrition, healthy peer and adult relationship building, exposure to new activities to promote confidence, and support for young people to meet their full potential. \r\nSolas Project also has extensive experience working with and supporting short and long term volunteers. Volunteers make up the heart of the organisation, numbering over 150 volunteers in the 2016-2017 school year. The impact that EVS volunteers have on the children and the community is a special one. Similarly, the kids have a special impact on the volunteers. While the kids can exhibit challenging behaviours, partially due to their own challenging environments, volunteers routinely say the best part of their experience was spending time with kids and the fun they had with them. \r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project include:\r\n\u2022 Providing support through energetic long term volunteers to Solas Project\u2019s work with children and young people in South Inner City Dublin- with a focus to meetings its 5 objectives for children.\r\n\u2022 Encouraging a spirit of mutual learning for volunteers where they are supported in their learning and development while also supporting the learning and development of the children they are working with.\r\n\u2022 To further the values of Europe by supporting cultural sharing and widening the horizons of work and travel for volunteers, as well as the upcoming generation of children and young people in South Inner City Dublin. \r\n\u2022 Building both the personal and career capabilities of EVS volunteers who come to participate.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants:\r\nThe project will involve 3 EVS participants. Participants will be a mix of male and female, with one male and one female starting in September, to be joined by a third person of either gender in January. They should be enthusiastic about working with children and young people and willing to learn and try new skills. \r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nThe Club strives to be \u2018a home away from home\u2019. Sitting around a table having a meal, helping with homework, doing a fun activity together \u2013 in all these ways we are striving to create a loving environment that is safe, peaceful, encouraging, stimulating and constructive. We support children to grow up to be healthy, confident and caring members of their community. Volunteers will have the opportunity to lead activities, plan for trips, and participate in the office support of the programme. Other activity opportunities exist in The Bridge, to help young people transition to secondary school, in Solas Sport and Solas at School, in Step Up, one to one mentoring for secondary school students, and in The Yard, leading woodworking workshops for schools. The aim for all activities is to develop relationships, to broaden horizons and experience, and to build confidence and self-worth.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nWe will work with sending organisations to identify, prepare, and place volunteers in the most suitable activity for their experience and interest. Their placements are flexible to suit the interests of the volunteer and the needs of the programmes. Volunteers will be supported in three main aspects once at Solas Project. First, by the volunteer manager who will ensure they are integrating well to Solas Project and Dublin. Second, by the programme manager who will provide daily supervision to help with challenges in their work with children. And thirdly, by an external mentor who will support their personal development. Informal and non-formal learning will be ongoing driven by the volunteer's goals. Volunteers will work on Youthpass as means of goal development during their participation and offered the opportunity to complete it at the end.\r\n\r\nResults and Impact\r\nFirstly, the impact for the children is in the meeting of their basic needs for safety, health, stability, learning and fun with consistent adults and environment. It is in the broadening of their horizons through cultural sharing and awareness of opportunities. Secondly, the impact for volunteers is in the building of transferable skills for future study or employment, as well as in their own confidence and personal development. It is an opportunity for them to broaden their own horizons, experience a new culture and fully immerse themselves in the Dublin community. We also hope there will be a long term benefit to the larger community from sharing of cultures.

Each RO is involved in activities that benefit local communities, so volunteers will be directly aiding these communities with their service.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to meet the following objectives:   \r\n1) Challenge young people to become actively involved in society by \u2018being there\u2019 and caring for others, especially those on the edge of society\r\n2) Give the volunteer new skills and work experience through volunteering\r\n3) Develop the volunteer\u2019s capacity to work, and/or live in, groups/teams\r\n4) Get to know the British culture, people and language \u2018from the inside\u2019\r\n5) Promote intercultural dialogue between young people (in the volunteer group, but also in the local community of which the volunteer is part)\r\n6) Challenge the volunteer to reflect critically on his/her spirituality and be open to other religions & ways of life\r\n7) Benefit the Receiving Organisation with the enthusiasm and cross cultural experience of a volunteer, who is able to augment the work of paid staff members with energy, new perspectives and time to build relationships with the community/ client group being served. \r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that this project will involve 20 volunteers, who will have a range of socio-economic backgrounds. TfG encourage participation from volunteers who may otherwise struggle to access opportunities for higher education or work experience, whether this is due to geographical reasons, health problems, or economic obstacles. It is anticipated that the project will be accessed by both male and female volunteers. \r\n\r\nThe specific tasks of a volunteer will vary with the different ROs, but all will involve an element of service to others, and all volunteers will be given comprehensive training and ongoing support and supervision to help them manage the challenges of this type of work. \r\n\r\nSeveral methods (including the Youthpass tool and various TfG-created documents) will be used to monitor the success of the project and gain feedback on the learning achieved by the participants.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", "Time For God", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036071_coordinator"], ["5RR", "\u00d6nk\u00e9ntesek a B\u00e9k\u00e9\u00e9rt", "Time For God", 108965.0, "Type of activities: \r\nLong-term voluntary service (EVS), 11 Months.\r\nNumber of volunteers: 20 people\r\nPlacements: Budapest (12 vols), Magyarmecske and Gilv\u00e1nfa (3), Debrecen (3), Baja (1) and \u00c9rd.\r\nLength of service: September 1. 2017 \u2013 July 31. 2018\r\nCountries: France (1 volunteer), Germany (5), Italy (2), England (2), The Netherlands (2), Romania (3), Slovakia (1) Ukraine (4) \r\nCoordinating organisation MRSZ Foundation ODE Program Office. \r\nSending partners are 9 different organisations. They are with one expectation member of Ecumenical Diaconal Year Network.\r\nReceiving organisations: working with Roma, a kindergarten, homeless shelter, home for disabled, University Congregation in Debrecen and the Bethesda Children Hospital in Budapest.\r\nIn the project there will be 20 volunteer serving in Hungary for 11 Months arriving partly from the Eastern European region and Western Europe. \r\nThe program has received the name of \u2018Volunteers 4 peace\u2019 since the volunteer service is not only about helping others but also about volunteers expressing solidarity towards others or different social issues.  In today\u2019s Europe it is highly important to talk about and protest for peace-making.\r\nThis does not accrue only in humanitarian actions but also young people expressing their longing for peace and the acceptance of differences in a colourful group using their own abilities. \r\nThroughout the project the young people will have the chance not only to know the culture of others but to improve their personalities and take part of an intensive learning process. In this way they will help others and at the same time would be able to learn about themselves gaining considerable self-knowledge.  \r\nThe main goal of the project for the volunteers is to get involved and get engaged with the tasks of the placement. They will get all the help to define the common goals as well as their personal ones. In this project 20 volunteers are involved out of 4 partner countries (Ukraine) and 16 volunteers are from program countries. \r\nThis way there will be an intensive dialogue between the volunteers so they can learn much of each-other and at the same time will be able to observe the culture and the costumes of the other.  \r\nWe are planning on to create a Flash mob where volunteers and placements are calling the attention of the society for peace and peace making given the nature of Flash mob speaking loudly and spreading its message. Our whish is to call much attention to the dialogue and the importance of human relations and other goal would be to calling the attention and raising the awareness. \r\nBesides these every volunteer is creating a mini-project in their own placement to be a successful addition to their placements according to their own creative ideas. \r\nSpending a year at abroad is helping to get new experiences, improving new abilities and personalities. The young people can more effectively enter to the working area having a closer look about furthering their studies and what would their calling be later on.\r\nWe are holing that trough volunteering participants will continue to be actively involved in their communities and their positive example is going to activate others. We hope that volunteers will rise out of the communities of the placements of the very volunteers.\r\nFor some of the volunteers this will be the first working experience obviously not as employers or replacing other workers. \r\nThis way there could be created a useful dialogue in between the volunteers helping accepting the differences and the colourful communities. \r\nIn connection with the local community: \r\nVolunteers spend considerable amount of time with their hosting organization while doing their job and the same amount of time they will spend in their surrounding environment.", "http://www.timeforgod.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-HU01-KA105-036129_17"], ["2TJ", "ERASMOB 3 : La Mobilit\u00e9, une exp\u00e9rience pour tous en Nouvelle-Aquitaine !", "OXFAM", 789349.0, "During the request of accreditation in March, 2015, the FRMFR reaffirmed its incentive politics, organized since 2006 for the realization of actions leading the young people in vocational training to realize an European mobility.

Indeed more than 2 thirds of the MFR chose \u201cyoung\u201d mobilities over one 3 weeks duration or more.\r\nThe FRMFR positions as master of work of the mobilities Pro Efp with the will to organize thematic groups and so to exploit completely experience feedback:\r\n\u00b7 On the learning LV\r\n\u00b7 On the management of the interculturalit\u00e9 in the classes and the approach of the citizenship\r\n\u00b7 On the accompaniment of the young towards insertion \r\n\u00b7 On the use of the digital technology\r\n\u00b7 On the question of the wellness at work\r\n\u00b7 On the jobs related to agriculture and early childhood\r\nWe ask for guides because our young people are in + 80 % of the minors(miners) of 1st VOCATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA Year or CAPA(POSTGRADUATE LEGAL QUALIFICATIONS), very distant from the Mobility (Rural life, school and socioeconomic difficulties). In view of the international climate, our Boards of directors and Supervisory ministry wish that the MFR secures even more the mobilities of the learners and recommend strongly the presence of 1 guide permanently on-the-spot. The latter are so capable as we oblige it to install the young people in their company and family, to mesure the progress of activity and actions and to proceed to the final evaluations.\r\nAt the end of this project, the expected results are:\r\n- 100 %:\r\n\u00b7 consume all the mobilities.\r\n\u00b7 Agreements and completed certificates and corresponding to the quality criteria defined by the European Quality charter and the FRMFR\r\n\u00b7 reports of realized placements\r\n\u00b7 Europass (or similar version adapted to the expectations of companies) handed to the beneficiaries\r\n- Organized of 10 days of improvement for the referents Mobility with a rate of participation of more than 80 %.\r\n- 1 Commission \u00ab Education in Worlds and in the Others \u00bb/year, 2 Committees of Piloting / year, 5 Techniques Commitees/ year \r\n- Implementation of a regional demonstration of valuation of the mobilities a year \r\n- Publication of 4 \" Europe Otherwise\", our biannual publishing, in 2 years, information on the Facebook FRMFR, 2 publications of articles in external magazines.\r\n- Evaluation of the impact of the Mobility and the inquiries on needs and infringe structures", "http://www.ageuk.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035962_29"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HG1"}
