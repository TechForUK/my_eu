The staff participating will attend these courses at staged times during the academic year of 2014-2015, which will allow our institution to evaluate and build on their experiences.\r\nThis will lead to us being able to adjust and review our provision, where necessary ,in light of monitoring, feedback and evaluation as the participants attend their courses.\r\nWe aim to increase the capacity and sustainability of foreign language learning in our school by increasing and upskilling the number of teachers teaching French, rather than it being the sole remit of one member of staff. We are aware that our current model is neither practical or sustainable with the introduction of the new primary curriculum.\r\nOur establishment's expectations, as already communicated with the potential participants and which will also be monitored and reviewed throughout the project by the school's leadership team is that the participant's attendance will have a positive and measurable effect on  the teaching of French in school through improved methodology, linguistic competence and resourcing.\r\nWe believe that our suggested model will not only achieve these objectives but also help raise the profile of internationalism and the European dimension at Clarksfield Primary School through the sharing of the project not only with our pupils, but also with the wider school community with the potential to reach over 1000 people through its implementation.", "http://www.clarksfield.oldham.sch.uk", "Clarksfield Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000194_coordinator"], ["3LQ", "Improving Language Teaching and the European dimension in KS2", "Hey With Zion Primary School", 17317.0, "Background:  Current provision of language teaching reliant on one person and, although effective, the need for development and expansion has been identified.  We would like to increase the European and international dimension of our school and have therefore planned a project of development to implement these goals.\r\nObjectives: To develop/improve language teaching in KS2.  To expand the European dimension in school.  To develop partnerships with link schools by opening up methods of communication and undertaking projects.  \r\nNumber and profile of participants:  10 mobilities:  1 Higher Level Teaching Assistant/MFL Coordinator - current Spanish teacher. One joint mfl coordinator - NQT with language specialism in French.  5 KS2 teachers with basic language skills who need to develop language and methodology competences to facilitate teaching. 2 teaching assistants who support children with special needs- basic language skills.  Senior Manager with language skills - to implement curriculum changes and develop link partnership.\r\n\r\nActivities:  intensive language lessons, methodology training, using ICT resources, cultural awareness tasks, visiting partner schools.\r\nMethodology for carrying out project:  Conduct survey of language competences amongst participants, hold discussions with staff on desired outcomes of project, formulate plan.  Language preparation of participants. Contact with link school to discuss visits.  Discussion and preparation of  resources with children before visits. Participants increase involvement in  language teaching on return from mobilities, to develop over the project.  Dissemination to children, other staff, parents etc.  Increase in european \r\nactivities/projects.  Implement curriculum changes as a result of project. Evaluation.\r\n\r\nImpact:  As a result of the project more staff in school will be involved in the teaching of languages providing an improved curriculum and therefore increasing access and attainment of pupils.  In the long term we hope to enrich the learning of pupils by providing them with an environment that will encourage a love of languages and awareness of other countries and cultures, creating within them an enthusiasm for communicating with people from abroad.  We hope that our link with native speakers will facilitate this.", "http://www.heywithzion.oldham.sch.uk", "Hey With Zion Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002069_coordinator"], ["5LN", "Roundthorn Language Development Project", "Roundthorn Primary Academy", 17282.0, "Roundthorn Primary Academy is an outstanding school, in an area of Oldham, with high levels of deprivation and adults within the family home that have either no employment or very low skilled employment. The school serves a mixed population, the majority of who are of Pakistani heritage. Children enter nursery below national, particularly in communication and language, which impacts on all other areas of development. Almost all the children and parents have English as an additional language.\r\n\r\nThe current delivery model of MFL teaching in school consists of a Newly Qualified language specialist working in Years 3-6 supported by a MFL Lead, who delivers extra-curricular MFL club to KS1 children. Mr. James has had limited Primary experience and teaches French for 1 hour p.w. with each year group, supported by class teachers. While this is having some impact on the attainment of the children (greater emphasis does however need to be placed on vocabulary and opportunities to write in French), it is not developing the class teachers\u2019 knowledge and skills in this area as effectively as we want as they are starting from a low skill-set and confidence level. For sustainability purposes it is essential that staff access training that will enable them to deliver quality-teaching experiences. \r\n\r\nThe objectives and features of the Erasmus+ programme are the recognition of and validation of skills and qualifications, in particular skills for our staff and children, raising the profile and the need to teach MFL is exactly what we require to move the teaching and learning of French to the level we want.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the best way to improve the teaching and learning of French is to immerse our staff in the French language and way of life, as second language learners learn best from quality interaction with high functioning language users of that particular language. Therefore the  intention of the funding and our priority objective would be to enable 4 participants in 2018-19 and 4 more in 2019-2020  to access the Erasmus + programme resulting in more effective dissemination of skills and strategies across our school and beyond over time. Staff will have improved linguistic skills and capabilities which will ensure better outcomes for children. Leadership skills including the ability to monitor provision, assess outcomes and create opportunities for development of teaching and learning will be developed .The experience for children will be authentic and be more enjoyable as a whole, developing their linguistic abilities and cultural awareness. Whilst links with partner schools will be established so that joint projects with the children can be developed. \r\n. \r\nThe teaching of French will be an integral part of the curriculum at Roundthorn. The teachers will be confident to deliver lessons independently. There will be a variety of approaches and content to teaching and there will be a good and effective balance of all the 4 skills and grammar when lessons are observed. Staff will also be confident enough to share their good practice with colleagues outside of our school including sharing and developing resources and CPD. \r\n\r\nThere will be opportunities to develop the specialist networks across the Trust and LA for MFL in order that good practice and CPD can be shared on a wider scale.  It would be envisaged over time that the quality of delivery, the confidence of teachers and the enthusiasm for learning French will be enhanced to such a level that there would no longer be a requirement for specialist teaching. The assessment practices would also ensure that the children were meeting at least the required standard, that they were also making accelerated progress and that they were proficient in the subject when entering the secondary phase there will be a greater number of our children choosing French or MF as an option in Year 9/10 The children will be excited about learning French and have a strong knowledge and respect for French culture\r\n\r\nThere will be a real buzz around school and French will be seen as strength of the school. It will have a raised profile with all staff and stakeholders due to it being a priority on the School Development Plan and directed funding .It will no longer be seen as a statutory requirement for Key Stage 2 children but as an entitlement for all children regardless of ability or age and as a key driver for excellence in teaching and learning.", "http://www.roundthornprimaryacademy.co.uk", "Roundthorn Primary Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047325_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "OL4"}
