These articles will be linked with specific project areas such as Hotel and Catering Food and ICT App Creation. Many of these articles will involve use of the target language and in some cases be in the target language. 90 Spanish students of a similar age will complete similar tasks.\r\n\r\n2) KS2 language learning: We will build up a bank of resources and expertise using Twin Space for shared resources to use within the KS2 Primary school environment.\r\n\r\n3) KS4 students of Vocational German and Spanish, Law, Business Studies and Economics students and Food Technology students in both schools will use twin space to explore, compare and contrast vocational areas including hotels and catering, tourist attractions, planning a visit abroad, retail and primary education. This will involve a large number of students - 50 students from UK school and a similar number from our Spanish and German partner schools.\r\n\r\n4) KS5 year 12 students of all disciplines involved in the project in both countries will exchange and evaluate detailed information on education systems, legal systems and the world of work, with a view to carrying out structured vocational experiences int he target country during the mobility of the project. This will involve around 50 students per institution in Germany, Spain and UK.\r\n\r\nThe project is driven by a passion to bring a European dimension into a large and diverse number of subjects across the curriculum as well as extend MFL learning beyond the MFL classroom and into other subject areas and vocational settings. The cultural topics we have chosen form a a significant part of the curriculum already in all three of our schools and we believe will serve to give all staff and students involved a genuine and enriching experience. The project will enhance Sackville School's position with its highest level of International Schools Award and IES Vega del Jarama's status as a bilingual college.\r\n\r\nThe objectives and impact of the project will be realised by students:\r\n1) Expanding diversity of the partner country by evaluating identified areas of culture in the countries. This will involve practical tasks such as giving video presentations of practical Food tech lessons or certain aspects of health and social care.\r\n2) Extending linguistic abilities so students can discuss and evaluate in the foreign language. This will also include older students helping with and presenting  primary school lessons. \r\n3) Give students access to vocational opportunities through work experience, work shadowing and visits to work places and social providers, thus allowing the provision and evaluation of opportunities abroad. This in some cases will serve as an official assessment for public examinations\r\n4) Broaden use of technologies for expanding and sharing of information. This will involve making videos.\r\n5) Involve students in planning of their own mobilities\r\n6) Evaluate the provision of Special Educational Needs for students of MFL in all 3 institutions\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits will be evident through sustainable partnerships between the institutions with students and staff incorporating tasks and projects within the institutions into their programmes of work.", "http://www.sackville.w-sussex.sch.uk", "Sackville School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002168_coordinator"], ["1QY", "Great literature, great language", "Imberhorne School", 7769.0, "We would like to establish a two year project to refresh the skills of our MFL teachers, improving their language skills and becoming up to date on the ways in which language use has changed,  current culture and innovative teaching methodologies, making language learning more relevant, rewarding and enjoyable for students. \r\n\r\nWe would like our teachers to regularly deliver outstanding lessons and want to adapt our schemes of work to help then achieve this. There is now a strong focus on the teaching of \u201cgreat literature\u201d in the target language. We need to find ways of introducing more literature written by target language authors across all year groups. We want our staff to have the opportunity to observe how literature is taught in other countries and to share good practice with staff in link schools. We believe that the teaching of languages can have a great impact on children\u2019s achievement in literacy and would like to have the opportunity to discuss with others ways in which this can best be achieved. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important priorities for our department is to increase international links and to use them more productively in order to give our children insights into real language and culture, make their learning more real to them and allow them to communicate with students in schools abroad. \r\n\r\nWe would like all our staff to feel that they are in a good position to be able to ensure that all the students are making the best possible progress, particularly our SEN pupils. We would like to have access to training and observation of good practice that will help us to achieve this.\r\n\r\nWe want to extend the provision of cross departmental language training opportunities and find new materials and ideas that will help us to promote the integration of languages into other subject areas and a cross curricular approach. We also want to improve contact with the key stage 2 MFL coordinators in our feeder primaries to share the good practice we have acquired and develop our arrangements for transition.\r\n\r\nWe plan to meet these identified needs through a project in our school lasting two years. Within this project we would like to involve staff from the MFL department in a series of visits Spain, France and Italy. We would like them to take part in training courses in these countries. \r\n\r\nThe courses will involve intensive language training, a programme of cultural events and information, teaching methodology, new ideas and resources and the opportunity to be placed in a Spanish/French/Italian school as part of the course. There will also be discussion of issues and topics related to language learning and the opportunity to share ideas and experience with other participants on these courses. The course will include specific sessions on teaching literature and will include recommended texts. It will also look at ways in which learning foreign languages can improve children\u2019s literacy and general attainment across the curriculum. There will also be discussion of transition from primary to secondary, ways of making the most of international links, ideas for supporting children with low basic skills and special educational needs and ideas for cross curricular work.\r\n\r\nThis course will also give us the opportunity to spend time in a French, Spanish and Italian school, making lasting links with staff and pupils and gaining an understanding of their culture and education system.  \r\n\r\nThe impact on our school will include better teaching and learning of languages, with more up to date language and cultural references, more cross curricular links, and more of a focus on literacy and the integration of literature into our teaching. This will impact on our children\u2019s enjoyment of language learning and will lead to higher attainment. We also hope that they will be a great impact on the children in our school with low basic skills. This will impact on their attainment across the curriculum and build their self-esteem.\r\n\r\nLinks with schools abroad will motivate and engage learners and give them a real purpose for language learning, and will also greatly increase their depth of understanding about the cultures of these countries. We also hope that it will impact on their future plans and ambitions and give them more motivation to travel and potentially work in these countries leading to better career possibilities.\r\n\r\nWe will develop new schemes of work for languages which will impact on language teaching across our school. \r\n\r\nStaff who do not take part in the visits will also benefit through the programme of dissemination and training resulting from this project. We also hope to have an impact on other schools in our local area and beyond. \r\n\r\nWe will also impact upon parents and their wider community through the activities we will run as a result of this project. We will encourage them to value languages and to get involved as much as possible with languages in our school.", "http://www.imberhorne.co.uk", "Imberhorne School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013229_coordinator"], ["4LZ", "P\u00e9riode de formation en milieu professionnel \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger", "ROAST.jobs ltd", 30798.0, "Les Grippeaux is a rural vocational school which has 373 pupils mainly from popular backgrounds. \r\nThey do not appear to be very mobile or ambitious in their studies or their careers.\r\nHowever, they are recruited in accordance with their first choice among their study options which \r\n means they have clearly chosen the branch they are in.\r\n               We train about 300 students for professional high school diplomas (100 for years 1, 2 and 3).\r\nWe expect our students to develop their mobility and cultural open-mindedness as well as their professional experience. The \"mobility option\" which is taken into account for the high school diploma appears to be a strong incentive for us.\r\nWe also worked on the opening of a European English section in September 2017. \r\n              We would like 10 % of our students ( 20% in the end) to experience professional training in another European country under the responsibility of a local tutor.\r\n        \r\nFor this, we lean on a steering committee with recognized and varied competences.\r\n              Before that, the students are encouraged to prepare their mobility with their family through information and training (development of every student' s ambition).\r\n              Should the number of students exceed the amount of grants we would therefore make a selection based on the following criteria: 1-motivation 2- social requirements 3- school results\r\n              The selected students will be supervised by their teacher and the local tutor who both will be able to exchange on the Internet via different means of communication.\r\n              The students will have the possibility to validate their experience thanks to  the \"mobility option\" and then assert it through Europass documents.\r\nWe hence hope to develop a desire for mobility and career ambition. For this, we  favor exchanges  between students of all levels (testimonies, guidance between students,  work-groups).\r\nIn the end, the school's European ambition is to be reasserted through the perpetuation and the development of mobility and the opening of European classes.\r\nSo far, the recent opening of the English European section appears to be one of the concrete results of our determination together with our decision to apply for a foreign language assistant.", "http://www.roastjobs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047491_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH19"}
