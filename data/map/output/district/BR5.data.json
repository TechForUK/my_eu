Hosting countries are Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Lithuania and the Czech Republic. Job shadowing activities for staff will take place in the Netherlands and will address themes such as the integration of migrants and other groups facing social exclusion through professional training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n70 mobility actions are expected to be undertaken. Participants' mobility will occur in the summer of 2015 and 2016. Several activity areas will be encompassed by the MOVINVET project: Administration and Finance, ICT, Trade, Industry, Health and Social Services. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVINVET will benefit 6 professional training centers located in Seville that are part of the consortium as well as the Teacher Training Center of Seville, a public entity responsible for continuous training activities for teacher in the province of Seville. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is divided in several stages, namely:\r\n\r\n- selection,\r\n\r\n- preparation;\r\n\r\n- mobility period;\r\n\r\n- evaluation;\r\n\r\n- dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project's main goal is to improve the participant's employability skills through the development of a broad training itinerary that upgrades trainee's professional, language and personal skills. Furthermore, the project addresses the quality improvement of training supply, bridging the gap between participants and the corporate world, the European entity knowledge and the establishment of international working networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium created strengthens sustainability. Tasks regarding the dissemination of results are of essential to attract other local and international partners for the project. Plus, including reference teacher training centers in this project ensures that its outcomes will impact on other training centers. This presents the need for strong communication activities and the transfer of acquired knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVINVET project emphasizes on the quality of procedures and results. The project includes the use of several tools previously developed through research projects and that emphasize key competences such as interculturality or the use of languages through efficient resources.
