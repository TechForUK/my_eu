Despite Europe\u2019s global market share, the pressures experienced by the SME European media advertising sector are considerable, particularly for those marketing paper billboards using toxic ink and glue waste. These pressures, including international competition, industry consolidation and increasing incorporation of costly digital signage technologies into the advertising industry, are important factors impacting SMEs, given their limited access to investment capital. Consortium SMEs have therefore identified a clear need for an outdoor media technology that can replace paper billboards, is affordable, as equally market-effective as digital advertising and that can generate consumer appeal. However, consortium members lack investment capital and expertise to guide them in the development of such a technology, constituting this a significant threat to their competitiveness within the industry. To meet such competition, the proposed ECOBOARD solution will create a pixel-based advertising board capable of displaying static images in near real-time with relatively low initial and operational costs. ECOBOARD will use existing innovative technology combined with creativity and precision engineering to produce a new eco-friendly advertising tool that does not harm the environment. The commercial objective of this ECOBOARD is the development of a state of the art advertising outdoor media tool which provides an affordable alternative to paper billboards, and that can increase the competitive advantage of consortium SMEs in light of increasing sector dominance by large enterprises, thereby opening up new markets both within Europe and worldwide.", 158482.0, 1157783.0, "ECOBOARD", "Reducing billboard advertising waste", "Giant posters and billboards are a major advertising tool globally mainly operated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A new technology offers economic and environmental advantages.", "In Europe alone there are between 2 and 8\u00a0million billboards displayed at any given time and this number is constantly growing. Every 2 weeks, over 6\u00a0million square metres of poster paper are thrown out. The paper is not recycled, the ink is not eco-friendly, and the glue used is toxic. Due to this, billboard advertising has a disastrous effect on the environment, and this issue needs to be addressed.\n\nThe EU-funded http://ecoboard.mfkk.hu/u/prjindex.php (ECOBOARD) project has produced a cost-effective and environmentally friendly real-time outdoor media tool. It is able to produce the same visual effect as a paper-based billboard, but without the use of polluting paper, ink and glue. Furthermore, the proposed system can boost the competitiveness of the advertising industry for SMEs by reducing the time and the cost of advert implementation as there is no need to print.\n\nThe first steps in the research involved evaluating and selecting rolling-foil materials to display colours, then designing and integrating these into 8*8\u00a0mm pixels. These were then arranged in modules \u2014 for example, 30*30\u00a0pixels \u2014 that could be combined to produce a pixellated, paperless billboard. Each module contains a movable motor to switch pixel foil colours individually.\n\nThe final step was the integration of all the components, including the housing. For a half-metre\u2013square billboard, some 100\u00a0000 individual components were needed. As part of the dissemination activities, a portable mini-board called ECODRIVE was developed to demonstrate the technology. The project also demonstrated computer control of the pixels via an Iinternet connection.\n\nECOBOARD SME partners are investigating the exploitation potential of this new technology, including production, marketing and distribution. When implemented, it will contribute substantially to reducing the pollution and landfill arising from billboard advertising.", "http://www.eco-board.eu", "http://www.maydown.com", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58285.jpg", "fp7_94522_998269002"], ["2AB", "Advancing understanding of Atlantic Salmon at Sea: Merging Genetics and Ecology to resolve Stock-specific Migration and Distribution patterns", "Loughs Agency (Fcilc)", "Over the past two decades, an increasing proportion of North Atlantic salmon are dying at sea during their oceanic feeding migration. The specific reasons for the decline in this important species are as yet unknown, however, climate change is likely to be an important factor. In some rivers in the southern part of the salmons range, wild salmon now face extinction. This is in spite of unprecedented management measures to halt this decline. Arguably the greatest challenge in salmon conservation is to gain insight into the spatial and ecological use of the marine environment by different regional and river stocks, which are known to show variation in marine growth, condition, and survival. Salmon populations may migrate to different marine zones, whose environmental conditions may vary. To date it has been impossible to sample and identify the origin of sufficient numbers of wild salmon at sea to enable this vital question to be addressed. SALSEA-Merge will provide the basis for advancing our understanding of oceanic-scale, ecological and ecosystem processes. Such knowledge is fundamental to the future sustainable management of this key marine species. Through a partnership of 9 European nations the programme will deliver innovation in the areas of: genetic stock identification techniques, new genetic marker development, fine scale estimates of growth on a weekly and monthly basis, the use of novel high seas pelagic trawling technology and individual stock linked estimates of food and feeding patterns. In addition, the use of the three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modelling System, merging hydrography, oceanographic, genetic and ecological data, will deliver novel stock specific migration and distribution models.

The different topics are: Sexual diseases and prevention, Sexual health education, sustainability and food, Gluten Intolerance, Nutritional choices, Sports and healthy lifestyle, humor and how to use all this information after the project. These sessions will be given through different working methods such as role play, energizers, working groups, interactive games, simulation games, group discussions, presentations through short movie/powerpoint/... and of course a debriefing after each session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective is to give youth workers and experienced trainers in youth work the opportunity to share their knowledge about health topics such as nutrition, sports, safe sex,\u2026 and how to sensitize youngsters towards these essential topics. The partner organizations come from different countries of the EU and will send 2 to 3 participants. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seminar will be divided in different workshops and group sessions where every partner will present his own actions and campaigns. We will work in a non-formal way.  This will enable a debate from which new ideas for future projects on a local, national and international level will emerge. The last day will be devoted to feedback so that we can put the emphasis on the importance of creating high quality and innovative projects in this field. We will give a list of the different organizations and participants to all the participants. The seminar will take place in a place close to the nature to enjoy the healthy aspects of this location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impact we hope for, is to bring more information through different channels to European youngsters to make them aware of the importance of health and to encourage them to live a healthier life.

Ignite for TRANSFORMATION! \r\n\r\nAnd.. theatre is an excellent method to use as ignition for transformation. In contrast to talking, theatre has the power to move directly into the heart and move people from within. Often you immediately get to the people\u2019s core beliefs and motivation. The visual language of theatre allows people to understand each other quickly without getting lost in misunderstandings. Besides, playing theatre is a lot of fun and creates a safe space, being it a great method to serve as a platform to address societal issues in a light-minded way, without losing its importance. Since theatre is a process in which trust and cooperation are essential for success, it is a helpful and interesting method of exploring different ways of thinking, weighing pro\u2019s and con\u2019s in order to be able to work together as a team. Furthermore it is a way for people to become aware of their independency and self confidence.  Through theatre people are more likely to discuss their own behaviour and  to reflect on that, it does make them think about a lot of things, about themselves and other people\u2019s points of view and validate their role in life and this society. Therefore it is a beautiful and very playful way of taking people \u201cby the hand\u201d in a process of self awareness and growth towards active citizenship.  Since theatre is a safe haven, with no goals in convincing and arguing with each other, it is by all means an excellent platform to \u201cplay\u201d with all sorts of societal issues - big or small -  in a cheerful way. \r\n\r\nThis training will take place between the 30th of May and the 7th of June, 2015.

The first 3 days of the training course are dedicated to develop connections between participants and to work at the same time on more personal competences that are essential in theatre. These activities are described as \"interconnection\" in the programme. From day 4 we work 3 full days with the \"Forum theatre\" method and we end these days with a Forum theatre performance. After the training participants will be more aware, openminded and selfconcious. They will be acquainted with severals methods of theatre which they can share with youngsters and peers and bring up social issues for discussion. Participating organisations will gain, via their participants, new knowlegde on behalf of their organisation and therefor will be able to offer new methods in working with young people. At the same time they will be able to use a dedicated network in Europe with whom they can work with in future activities.

Individual work with using the coaching methods inside the organization, as well as work with local communities, can increase the quality of NGOs' work generally and have direct influence on the target groups organizations work with.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we face a problem that youth workers representing NGOs which work for local communities have lack of coaching skills in their work. First of all, it is caused by the reason that youth workers are not aware about importance of these coaching skills. And as a result, they are not able to use in their work. Moreover, it is caused by lack of professional coaches and coaching trainers which are ready to share their knowledge and experience with youth workers, which in a way comes from lack of proper non-formal education, missing international cooperation in this field and supporting system between NGOs around Europe. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this training course are: \r\n- To learn about importance of coaching skills in youth work;\r\n- To learn coaching skills how to use different techniques and methods in individual coaching in order to guide and mentor volunteers knowing more methods and techniques.;\r\n- To practice different coaching techniques and methods;\r\n- To increase the quality of NGOs' work in local communities and inside their own organizations;\r\n- To establish partner relationships between organizations and create the support system;\r\n- To learn about opportunities for young people and youth organizations in frame of Erasmus+ Programme;\r\n- To plan the activities for future cooperation between the organizations.\r\n\r\nThe participants will be empowered to learn from their own experience and create their own individual knowledge and development concerned with issue.

while structural reforms begin to yield results.\r\n\r\nWhat in the past was just novelty for our young people in search of new challenges, has nowadays become compulsory if they want to have real opportunities to find a first job, sometimes outside our country and others gaining experience to develop it later in their country. \r\n\r\nWe must be communicators of information and training and make young people be aware of employment opportunities and put emphasis on working possibilities in other countries.\r\n\r\nWe also believe that it is essential to foster among our students a spirit of coherent competitiveness which we understand that will give them access to worldwide markets. \r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of competitiveness is improving the quality of training of our youth force.

Out of studies, such as The European Youth Forum\u2019s study about the contribution of non-formal education in terms of increased employability, the soft skills that employers most frequently demand include communication skills, organisational/planning skills, decision-making skills, team working skills, confidence/autonomy and numeracy. Five of these six most frequently demanded soft skills that employers require are also being amongst those skills developed to a greater extent in youth organisations, the exception being numeracy. \r\nThese soft skills are seen as a key element for successful job performance. Certain personality traits are also found to be important components of these skills and competencies, contributing to their development.  For example, sense of initiative and pro-activity are traits associated with confidence/autonomy and entrepreneurship. Employers do also have a positive attitude towards young people\u2019s experience in youth organizations. Employers however stress a special emphasis on the way of presenting the skills and competences (what they present, how they present it has more impact than what is written on the paper) acquired during the participation in youth work, which is an area where there is still room for improvement. \r\n\r\nIn youth work, we have the instrument of the youth pass at European level,  a lot of countries have own national recognizing tools for competences, and each young person can use the European CV format (the Europass CV) for presenting the skills and competences towards employers. But only few still know, how to work effectively with it (e.g. what to present if I have already Youthpass from 6 different events). \r\n\r\nWith this project we want to bring youth workers together, to support them in enabling young people to better assess and express their competences for employment purposes.\r\n\r\nYoung workers should be made more aware about the value that employers place on the skills and the competencies developed in the youth work, and youth workers can be trained in how to support the young people they work with, in this topic. That is the central focus in this project, containing a training course of 6 days, and a follow up meeting with the participants. \r\n\r\nThis goes in line with the recommendation of the European Youth Forum to work further on the transitioning to employability: there is a need to greater guidance and coaching for young people so that they are better able to present effectively the skills and competences they develop in the youth sector in job applications and that they are able to better understand how these skills may be applied in working environments, and can contribute to the performance of specific job-related tasks. \r\n\r\nIn the training course, participants will discover competencies for employment, will reflect upon the reality young people face when applying for jobs, will discuss employability and the role of youth work in it. \r\nYouth workers will be trained to formulating and articulating one\u2019 own competencies, and experiencing a range of methods and activities helping them to run similar activities with their own young participants in the youth work at home.\r\nParticipants will prepare pilot activities, workshops, sessions, methods for working on competencies with the young people of their own organisation. \r\nThese will be shared and improved, and then the participants will run them after the training course in their own organisations. \r\nIn a follow up meeting in February, we bring all the participants again together to share the experiences with each other, to investigate the success factors, to measure the effect, to improve the activities and to gain new insights, to finally collect those in a booklet which will be distributed amongst partners, but also further and wider, throughout all our European contacts.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-2-SK02-KA105-000611_3"], ["4EA", "\u201cWe will come together III\u201d Disadvantaged youngsters in European youth projects", "The Inside Out Programme", 11706.0, "The Contact-Making Event \u201cWe will come together III - Disadvantaged youngsters in European youth projects\u201d aims at supporting organisations from program countries from EU28 who are working on a daily basis with the target group \u201cyoungsters with fewer opportunities\u201d in implementing international mobility projects for socially and individually disadvantaged youngsters within Erasmus+/Youth.

By these projects \u2013 created by the participants of our project \u2013 the influence will be focused on multiplication \u2013 through this we will be able to get to a wide group of young people. \r\n\r\nThe cooperation network, which will be created during our training, will be one of the key principles that will support the generation of great impact. This network will remain well connected as the network of all participants that can participate at possible future editions of the When Social Meet Rights training course. The impact on the participants will be measured by the follow up projects made by them and also the number of people involved. We will as well send a late questionnaire two months after the training course that will measure the impact on the personality and work of the participants.\r\n\r\nImpact on a local community\r\nWe want to point out that the main outcome of our training will be that it is important to begin from yourself, from our \u201cown backyard\u201d, from local society. That is why we decided to show \u2013 based on our project \u2013 to show participants how important  the real influence on local society is. In terms of having impact on the  HOST CITY of Leicester, we planned meeting with local Institutions and NGO\u2019s. During these meetings, the participants will have opportunities to take a closer examination of examples of good practice, known in these NGOs. It will also give an opportunity to local NGOs to meet new young people, full of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe basic information and principles about the Youth in Action program will be placed at the WEBSITES OF HOST NGOs; these organisations will have already spent some months working to promote the course and are well known among our promoters.\r\nAwareness of the project will be done by spreading it into our European networks of promoters and making the ENGO aware of our project. Connected with this promotion is as well the use of yahoo groups and Internet social networks as Facebook, which we use to spread the information.\r\nThe promotion of the YiA programme will be assured during the meeting with the local key actors. We will present them with the idea of our project and the idea of the YiA programme. For the meeting, we plan to invite the local decision-makers to the opening ceremony which will publicise the YiA Programme. \r\nIn the programme of the training course, we will also made sure that the participants will understand its aim, objectives and philosophy. We will dedicate one session to exploring the youth programme in an entertaining way of using the simulation of an Auction. Participants will create ideas of project and will have to keep the rules of YiA. The trainers will give them feedback on their projects. This experience and knowledge gained in this exercise will help address the participants' needs when planning the future projects on the last day of the training.\r\n\r\nThe future projects planning sessions on the last day are aimed at having a follow up project that will multiply the experience, the YiA programme impact and make the programme visible during the new projects.\r\nAwareness about the sponsor of the project will be guaranteed by placing the logo of the programme at all materials printed, published and spread before, during and after the project.", null, "Global Hands Leicester (CIC)", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA105-012414_6"], ["4EA", "Ritmi mladosti / Rhythm of Youth", "The Inside Out Programme", 9843.0, "The \u201cRhythm of Youth\u201d project is aimed at cultural diversity among the young.

Music workshops combined with generally beneficial content tied to music and performance is aimed at stimulating youth participation in society and personal development.\r\n\r\nThe young have always felt connected to music. Listening to music is the most frequent activity among the young only rivalled by watching TV. Unlike passive TV consumption, researchers stress the positive effects of listening to, creating and playing music. In addition to musical skills, such activities develop other useful abilities. Music also transcends borders and is a perfect medium for intercultural understanding and communication.\r\n\r\nParticipants will learn vocal technique, choir singing and harmonization, composing lyrics and performance skills; additionally the basics of self-presentation as well as proper use of Youthpass and Europass. Through engaged music they will learn how to critically engage with matter and express themselves creatively. They will also be exposed to the visual side of performing arts. They will be required to understand the basics of project organisation and promotion in line with the possibilities for the young by the Erazmus+ programme. The public performance workshop will build on acquired musical performance skills enabling the participants to leave a strong impression in personal interactions as well as public appearances. The final night of the exchange will feature a public performance, where participants will present their new skills and knowledge. The training and concluding event will be filmed and edited to serve as promotional presentation of the entire exchange and the multicultural interactions therein. At the same time the event will be a good opportunity to promote the Erazmus+ programme \u201cYouth in Action\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will include structured social games and performances aimed at getting to know each other and learning about each-other\u2019s diverse cultures and cultural diversity of the Bela krajina region. The gained cultural awareness and mutual understanding will further develop European civic consciousness and identity. \r\n\r\nThe project participants will be selected primarily based on their affinity for music. They will have manifested an interest in planning and implementing parts of the programme. Additional considerations are gender equality and affording the less privileged the opportunity to participate. The participants will be between 18 and 26, because the level of difficulty inherent on music creation demands maturity. We aim at relatable ages, age differences inadvertently result in hierarchical divides and social fragmentation.\r\n\r\nThe young participants will gain skills in creative teamwork, while performance training will strengthen their individual confidence and independence. Daily evaluations will contribute to a healthy self-critical attitude while strengthening motivation. We will also aim to hone their social skills, a key element for creating opportunities in a world where collaboration and mutual support are growing ever more important. The participants will be asked to create, prepare and conduct parts of their performances on their own, with the mentors and leaders acting as guidance support only, which will stimulate their creativity and sense of initiative.\r\n\r\nThe participants will form fruitful connections enabling future collaborations. We will provide a safe and supportive environment to develop their confidence and self-image, both necessary for widening the scope of their cultural ventures and ensure a more active participation in society. Informal education programmes, such as this, are invaluable for the less privileged youth, because they enable cooperation and socialising in a supportive environment of equals affording equal opportunities.\r\n\r\nAll the activities described above will develop the capabilities and skills of the participants irrespective of their status of privilege, raising self-esteem and employability as well as bettering their cultural awareness and social interactions on an intercultural level. \r\n\r\nThe project will be featured on Internet sites and social media pages of all participating organisations, including a photo-journal of the exchange and a video presentation of activities and final public performance.

The seminar will implement a 360degree appraisal system for international trainers within the quality framework of international youth work trainings. The tool will be used to support the development of professional practice and the development of high quality non-formal youth work trainings. The meeting will take place in East Clare Golf Village in Bodyke, Ireland in spring 2016.CONTEXTThe seminar is taking place in the context of the newly emerging International Youth Work Trainers Guild (IYWT Guild) - an independent supportive community of trainers in the youth work sector that advocates on behalf of and contributes to each other\u2019s professional development. The aim of the Guild is to ensure defined quality standards in delivery of youth work training activities. The community endeavours to have a positive impact on Youth Policy and non-formal education as part of life-long learning at all levels within Europe and neighbouring regions. We hope to do this through establishing communication platforms and systems to ensure our recommendations are heard by decision makers and through acting as advocates on behalf of its members and represent and grow our professional identity.OBJECTIVES\u2022 To develop a reflection and feedback tool that promotes the professional development of trainers\u2022 To utilise and build on the set of trainer competences (ETS and SALTO)\u2022 To implement and test the reflection and feedback tool \u2022 To measure the impact on individuals development and the quality of trainings\u2022 To strengthen the quality of non-formal education within the youth work training sectorPARTICIPATING COUNTRIES16 Program countries: Ireland, Austria, Germany, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, FYR Macedonia, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Turkey, the UK. 9 Partner countries: EECA region \u2013 Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Western Balkans \u2013 Albania, Serbia, Montenegro. ACTIVITIESThe seminar is a meeting of international youth work trainers interested in exploring the development and piloting of a professional development and feedback tool. This involves participants critically reviewing the latest ETS Trainer Competences, offering recommendations and ideas for implementing a 360 feedback system for trainers, piloting and testing the developed system, reflecting and evaluating its functionality and value, exploring and understanding other appraisal systems and purposes, responding to the needs and proposed changes, full participation and contribution throughout the seminar, evaluation of the activity and open, transparent and consultative communication with the wider trainers world.METHODSThe diversity of methods will include: workshops about competences they have as youth trainers and tools they use to evaluate the quality of their work and youth trainings in general; peer interviews; assessment simulation games; work in small groups;  group analysis tools \u2013 360C\u00b0 evaluation, 6 thinking hats, Case clinics and Blossoming issue; imaginarium techniques (projection of the image of youth trainers, future vision of youth trainers); interactive presentations; Expert tables and World Caf\u00e9; individual work \u2013 assessment of trainers competences, and pair assessment, creative labs.IMPACT, RESULTS & LONG-TERM BENEFITSThe developed 360degree appraisal system will form an essential part of IYWT Guild\u2019s membership process and our aim is to cascade the opportunity after the Seminar. The documentation of the process through the digital reporting will inform the wider world of trainers and allow them to follow and feedback on developments. Each participant will have actively taken part in a self-assessment process of their trainer competences as well reviewed feedback from other stakeholders and identified their strengths and areas for development based on this analysis. They will also plan for further personal and professional development. For our partners it means supporting and investment in the opportunity and the professional development of the trainers they use in the field.On a wider scope, the seminar wishes to build on the importance of international youth work trainers taking more responsibility and having more autonomy for theirs and others professional practice.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

European values of pluralism, indiscrimination, acceptance, justice, and solidarity are reportedly threatened by economic difficulty and the growing migrant crisis. This is why we will build on music creation and performance to help promote a more tolerant and inclusive society with a positive perception of migrant men and women. We will examine migrations and the necessity for intercultural dialogue, research our migrant roots and experiences, and review how these issues are reflected in musical evolution.The participants will be selected based primarily on affinity for music and/or interest in migration issues. One of the key components in the selection process is equal gender representation while the underprivileged will have priority.

They will also be instructed in supporting activities of musical productions; i.e. organisation, promotion, direction and technical support. They will hone their skills in creative teamwork, the most difficult type of teamwork. Through collaboration and mutual support they will also improve their social skills, a key element of creating possibilities and opportunities for the young. They will be encouraged to think autonomously and critically while daily activities will contribute to a healthy self-appraisal and improve their motivation. Parts of activities will be prepared and executed by the participants to support their initiative. In a supportive and safe environment they will form fruitful personal connections while building confidence and a diverse skill-set enabling them to participate more actively in society. We plan to include social games and presentations aimed at getting better acquainted with fellow participants. This will build awareness and understanding of other cultures and contribute to the development of a healthy sense of European consciousness and identity.

In response to Brexit, president of the European Parliament recently stated in a public article that 'EU is in a existential crisis'. We'd like to address this deep crisis of identity and try to understand it through understanding our common history and current situation via storytelling methods. Through debating techniques we'd like to shape, develop and confront our opinions about Europe. In the end we will seek common solutions through cultural activism methods such as Theatre of the Oppressed and also stage a theatrical performance in the streets to include the local population into the discourse about European Union and its 'crisis'. \r\n\r\nThrough the project we would like to address a question: is European integration even possible in this moment and how? How to integrate different nations, and do they even want that (UK for example)? How do we also integrate tens of thousands of new citizens of EU that came here because of the wars in Middle East? We would like to address a human need for common identity and make sense of this identity in the context of European Union.

Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school).

The awareness of these is not always easy to understand by young people nowadays. Therefore, in order to tackle the issue we wish to make the following objectives:\r\n\u2022 Give to participants the tools and competences to understand what civil society is and what is its role in our own societies; \r\n\u2022 Familiarize the participants with concepts and approaches of non violent actions i.e. how to use it best and adapt it to local contexts and realities in order to promote peace building;\r\n\u2022 Equip the participants with skills to act in order to fulfill their goals;  \r\n\u2022 Empower the young people to act wisely in conflicts on individual as well as societal levels;\r\n\u2022 Review and enhance participants\u2019 competences (knowledge, skills, attitudes) in working as  multipliers, and activists on peace building using non formal education tools;\r\n\u2022 Enable participants to develop activities and campaigns for multipliers in conflict transformation and non-violent actions, at international, national or local level.\r\n\r\nThe project will include 30 youth workers/leaders from 13 programme countries for 8 days (including travel days) in Austria.

From our point of view this is the best way of showing the EU achievements in the fields of the European rights and freedoms for their citizens, by allowing the new generations to get first-hand knowledge, through a successful program, as is the Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nThe target group of this project will be young adults aged between 18 and 35, already graduated on VET within 12 months before the starting point of the mobilities by any of the formative centers in the Consortium.

Positive effects also reside in listening and playing music as well as creating music. Singing doesn\u2019t just influence our mood, but it also has a positive impact on the physical state of our body. Breathing and the trembling of vocal chords have a therapeutic power, making our heart beat faster and helping our blood circulate through the body. This releases endorphins to our brain which makes us happy. Group singing, playing and creating music enables interaction with people, which establishes real harmony through building bridges between individuals hailing from different cultures.\r\n\r\nEuropean values such as tolerance, justice, solidarity and non-discrimination are facing a difficult challenge today, especially in times of accelerated migrations and economic crises. However, migrations are an important and inevitable part of the economic and social life of every country, therefore it is important to sensitise young people to it in order for them to see the positive sides of multicultural societies. Our task is to incite young people to be open and curious so that we can overcome elements of xenophobia and racism together. This is all the more important in this time when radical nationalisms are dangerously growing and attracting young vulnerable people who sometimes do not see meaning in their lives and are then seeking it in groups with dangerous views due to their lack of feeling of safety.\r\n\r\nWith the goal to increasing our understanding of the relationship between cultures, we have invited partner organisations from Lebanon and Jordan to cooperate with us. These two countries comprise a very intercultural society, which also includes many refugees. Participants from these countries will share their perspectives on migration and the possibilities of a harmonious co-existence. During the exchange, we wish to contribute to the reflection on European as well as Mediterranean identity. We will be exploring the connection between the participating countries as well as the cultural contrasts that will be enriching us. We will focus particularly on the problem of Islamophobia which can lead to a radicalisation of nationalistic groups and violence towards migrants and refugees. By combining young creative minds from European and South-Mediterranean countries in the harmony of singing and through other connecting activities of the exchange, we wish to reach a higher level of connectivity and consciousness between young people in order for them to continue being accepting, inclusive and active citizens. \r\n \r\nWe will be choosing participants according to their affinity for music and interest for the intercultural dialog. Participants will be aged between 18 and 30, as we believe the theme of the exchange requires a certain level of maturity. The key to choosing the participants will also comprise an equal representation of the two genders as well as the priority for participants with fewer opportunities, especially refugees, asylum seekers and young people with migrant backgrounds. Participants with fewer opportunities will be cooperating and socialising in the frame of a supporting environment where all are equal and opportunities are balanced. The goals set will be pursued through non-formal methods of teaching music and intercultural dialog that will be entirely prepared and conducted by participants under the mentorship of group leaders and staff.\r\n\r\nYoung participants will prepare practical workshops, a photo marathon team building, games, presentations, intercultural evenings, an excursion and shows with local artists. We will also organise a public concert where participants will present all the acquired knowledge to the public. In addition, this event will be an excellent opportunity to promote the E + Youth in Action program. \r\n\r\nDuring the exchange, participants will gain knowledge of vocal technique, choir singing, harmony and performance, but they will also learn about supporting activities such as music production.
