They also represent a new employment sector for young people, who show an increasing desire and energy of reinterpreting the traditions and resources of their territory.\r\nThe project Buds Budding Mobility Plus was born by an active cooperation in the field of agribusiness within South Tuscany, that was also strengthened by the creation of three Professional-Technical Centre in the provinces of Grosseto, Siena, Arezzo.\r\nThe members of the Professional-Technical Centre strongly believe in the importance of young people\u2019s training in transnational contexts, in order to give them more employment opportunities, to facilitate their empowerment, to help them becoming aware and active UE citizens and workers.\r\nThe territories have expressed the will to strengthen the combined school/work, to meet the needs of enterprises understood thanks to the new networks, to promote the full employability of young people and the growth of the working level in agri-food business. This sector has become important together  with tourism and cultural heritage in view of the increasing of territory development and its sustainability.\r\nThe strategy of Europe 2020 intend to boost the EU economy for the next decade in an intelligent  and sustainable way. The excellence of agribusiness in Tuscany perfectly accommodate these principles that are main part of Tuscany image in the world. Here that\u2019s why BBuM+ presents THE CONCEPT OF GREEN AGRIBUSINESS  in connection to the CONCEPTS OF SUSTAINABLE EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT.\r\nEXPO 2015 has alreadyended but created an echo to greater awareness that the agri-food business is a source of wealth in integrated and sustainable system which present more and more our wonderful excellences: prestigious production, historical and cultural heritage, landscape and geographical characterizations (spa, sea, hills, etc ..): there is no history without wine, art without the smell of typical agri-food, music without an aroma of a story tale.\r\nBuBM+ responds to the needs of competitiveness and internationalization of our enterprisesin the same time provides young people with tools to grow as individuals and to enter into the working world with better prospects and portfolio of experience and competences. 121 young people with BuBM+ will have an equal opportunity to grow personally and professionally, through linguistic and cultural preparation and 30 days of training abroad for students and 3 months for new graduates and new qualified  in SMEs in Spain, Netherlands, Malta, France, Germany, Portugal. They will develop the life skill needed to be full citizens and to be integratedquickly into the working world. They will have possibility to develop the green skill to accompany  the growth of sustainable Europe.\r\nWe aim to guidethem in the choice of business / territorial areas where the mobility experiences will take place, by trying to meet the territory\u2019s needs.\r\nSpecific surveys have been carried out along with the social partners and the data resulting from previous professional and training needs surveys had been taken into account too. This transnational action will be characterized by innovative and cross features as:\r\n- INNOVATIVE TECHNICAL-PROFESSIONAL SKILL  for AGRICOLTURE / FOOD INDUSTRY and TOURISM / CULTURAL HERITAGE\r\n- GREEN SKILL in reference to the sectors of agribusiness\r\n- Support and DEVELOPMENT OF KEY COMPETENCES for lifelong learning\r\n- Support and specific attention to YOUNG PEOPLE WITH FEWER OPPORTUNITIES and / or at risk of exclusion\r\n- ACQUIRED SKILLS RECOGNITION through reconstruction, description and validation in compliance with UE Recommendations, in particular EQF, EQAVET and ECVET.\r\nEach school involved will be associated with learning experiences representing  education and / or training credits, that will provide the young with at least one specific skill / performance among those identified in the regional Directory of Professional Figures, or in the national partners directories, in order to create new skill suitable for the local and European labor market.", "http://www.yeoldebell-hotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005789_21"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["0PD", "RHA", "Rampton Hospital"], ["7XF", "RP5", "Retford Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN22"}
