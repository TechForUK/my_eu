These ligno-cellulosic materials originated from rural locations will be upgraded and densified into uniform sizes at source, allowing cost-effective transportation to existing industrial sites. The core enabling technology is superheated steam processing (SHS). SHS has been implemented in diverse drying applications at industrial scales, due to its superior heat transfer properties. At pilot scales, SHS has been proven to torrefy biomass at temperatures up to 300\u00b0C with minimal ligno-cellulose breakdown. Unlike conventional torrefaction techniques, which use flue gases as heating medium, it does not contaminate the torrefied biomass and volatile fractions, allowing economic recovery of chemicals. Moreover, it is also readily scalable for continuous operation. In SteamBio, a transportable demonstrator unit will be operated at five different rural locations where it will be used to torrefy tonnage quantities of six different agro-forestry residues at a throughput of 500 kg/h. The demonstrator unit will be operated at these rural locations throughout the last twelve months of the project to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the composition of the materials being valorised. The torrefied biomass fractions (solid and liberated volatiles) will then be validated as green building blocks in commercially relevant chemical production and in bioenergy use. Life cycle experts will validate that SteamBio will have positive environmental impacts. A robust business strategy will be developed to enable the results to cross the 'valley of death' post-project and to ensure widespread market replication. Project delivery will be achieved by an interdisciplinary team from research and from the entire industrial and commercial supply chain from fields through to factories.'", 386257.0, 5701746.0, "SteamBio", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_193430_998195573"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8NB", "Stages Pour les \u00e9l\u00e8ves  et enseignants du Buat", "CLT Language Training Limited", 92222.0, "The Secondary Vocational Private Agricultural School Lyc\u00e9e le Buat specializes in technical courses in the pet shop and service sector.

We will use ICTs to work in international groups and reflect together on our different experiences and perspectives of our recent past. \r\n- To make pupils independent learners and to research and select appropriate material to design the website and the learning materials.\r\n- To produce unbiased teaching resources that can be used to educate pupils about the Cold War, overcoming the problem of viewing history from a national perspective by examining the same issues from the point of view of the four partners. These teaching materials will be elaborated by pupils for pupils, and could be teacher-led or used by independent learners. \r\n- To develop the ability to assess current political developments from a wider, more objective perspective. We will ask our students to compare the Cold War era with ours, looking for similarities and differences.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nEach school is inviting a small number of pupils aged 15 -17 in year one and year two of the project.  Most will take part across both years with between 15-20 pupils from each school involved in the project in total.  For some periods the number of pupils involved will rise considerably (e.g. in the common activity meetings when whole school classes will be involved in trying out the new material and giving feedback).
