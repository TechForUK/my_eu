Secondly novel designs can have features that do not satisfy the premise of existing rules, thereby setting them free from fire safety rules by default, often leading to unsafe designs.     In order to remedy this problem the proposed project 'FIREPROOF' would develop a very universally applicable regulatory framework for maritime fire safety based on probabilistic models and numerical models of ignition, growth and impact of fires. The framework would be quite similar in principle to the well established probabilistic damage stability regulation. The methodology of the proposed fire safety regulation is summarized as follows:  The methodology would consist of a mathematical model that would generate instances of fire  scenarios according to the correct probability distribution of the elements of the scenario.  It would also consist of numerical models to assess the consequence of the scenarios so generated.  For any given ship - traditional or novel, a large number of scenarios would be generated  and their consequences assessed, and the results would be aggregated to give rise to fire risk  metrics.

The model combines a well-established approach to professional learning, known as \u2018lesson study\u2019, with an emphasis on listening to the views of students, which is a distinctive feature of the model. Most importantly, the model facilitates dialogue between children and teachers in order to develop inclusive responses to diversity.  \r\n\r\nThe issue of including all children in schools is a challenge faced by teachers across Europe (Corak, 2004). In addition, though there is research that has involved students in commenting on practical aspects of schooling - such as school uniforms and aspects of the environment \u2013 much less research has focused on using their ideas to improve learning and teaching.

Researchers will work closely with the headteachers and a trio of teachers in each of the hub schools in using the model.  Children will also be trained as researchers. \r\nCycle 2. The approach will be used in 5 more schools in each country, whilst at the same time expanded in the hub school, with systematic monitoring of the impact on teachers\u2019 thinking and practices, and students\u2019 engagement. \r\nCycle 3. The approach will be used extensively in the 30 participating schools and disseminated to all schools in each of the cities involved. \r\nThe intended outcomes are:\r\n1. A Guide\r\n2. A DVD\r\n3. A Manual for Training children as researchers\r\n4. A Pupil Voice Toolkit\r\n5. Case studies (5 in total)\r\n6. A Guidance document for monitoring impact on teachers \r\n7.

This will have longer term benefits both for teachers and for students. Teachers that take part will change their future practices and embed the idea of students\u2019 voices and lesson study in their practices.  Children\u2019s participation will be increased through the process of the project, especially for those students that are hard to reach, since they will be trained to take the role of researchers.   Overall, all students in the 30 participating schools, as well as in other organisations who will adopt the approaches via dissemination plans, will be empowered through such approaches and develop skills that are essential for active citizens, such as expressing their views more freely and having a say in decision-making. This will have longer term impacts in relation to the inclusion of all, but especially for those who are hard to reach.
