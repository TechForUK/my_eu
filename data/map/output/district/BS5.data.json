The overall aim of the project is to promote participatory democracy through community building and civic initiative.\r\n\r\nThe project organized from June 24 until July 3 and will involve 34 youth workers, trainers, project managers and youth leaders coming who will represent 16 organizations from 10 European countries.

Regarding local events, each session will involve 15-20 youngsters aged 15-25 years old.\r\n\r\nThe project stems from Inter Alia\u2019s continuous problematization about the future of participatory democracy in Europe and the role of youth in shaping it. It sets off from the observed inconsistency between the international reputation of EU countries with regards to the quality of democratic institutions (Democracy Index, 2016) and their apparent incapacity to uphold the values that have made these institutions effective and popular in the first place (more recently manifested in the face of the economic and refugee crises). Ongoing challenges such as recession, unemployment, extremism and xenophobia are seen as by-products of Europe\u2019s derailment from its constitutional values. Those challenges cannot be sustainably addressed by mere compliance with rules imposed from the top-down but necessarily through the demand of citizens for fairer, more inclusive and democratic, societies.\r\n\r\nThe role of youth work and youth workers in the process of augmenting, canalizing and communicating this demand constitutes the main concern driving FOLLOW THROUGH. The aim is to enhance the role of youth work in fostering local level solutions to pan-European challenges of democracy and collective action. More specifically, FOLLOW THROUGH aspires to provide youth workers with new, effective and up-to-date tools for inducing trust of youth in EU values.

It foresees that participants will be led to the woods in the rough terrain of Epirus  and then, unwarned, will be left alone. For surviving this challenge, they will need to build a community and show leadership skills. Then, they will share their experience as part of a collective learning procedure.

The corrective action of REVaLUE will strive to tackle all major causes that prevent refugees\u2019 labour integration, namely:- lack of recognition of knowledge, competence and skills, including previous studies;- deskilling;- lack of working experience in the host country;- language.Through a solid partnership, made of a combination of VET providers and migrant associations based in Italy, France, Germany, UK and Hungary, the project will:1. facilitate the recognition of formal, non-formal and informal knowledge, competences and skills of refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through the design and implementation of a toolkit for migrants' skills assessment; 2. transfer new highly qualifying skills to refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through tailored VET courses, one for \u201cMigrant Service Providers\u201d and another for \u201cSocial Enterprise Manager\u201d, that meet their specific learning needs and characteristics, in particular the language; 3. provide refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers with hands-on experience through the creation and implementation of work-based laboratories.The target group of project REVaLUE will be refugees/subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers recently arrived to Europe. Female migrants will be given special consideration, integrating a gender approach in the design and implementation of project\u2019s products. Although the beneficiaries of the action are constituted by humanitarian migrants only, the project\u2019s products will be applicable to other kinds of migrants as well.The innovative feature of REVaLUE lies in the creation of 2 VET courses that put together the best characteristics of VET teaching methodologies (use of audio-visual teaching material, work-based training) with the needs and requirements of adult education (acquisition and strengthening of basic skills) all bound together with an effective language methodology (CLIL \u2013 Content and Language Integrated Learning). This innovative combination will make an exceptionally complete learning experience for the beneficiaries and will constitute an important example for future training development. The courses, moreover, will provide training for accessing well remunerated, medium/high-skills jobs in two sectors that are generally receptive to the participation of non-native workers, creating real opportunities for the beneficiaries to escape the low socio-economic cycle in which they often find themselves. A second innovative aspect of project REVaLUE is that it creates a skills assessment tool designed to assess both informal and non-formal learning and the level of education attained in the home country. Informal and non-formal learning have to be properly assessed to determine the whole spectrum of competences and skills and to direct the person who is being assessed towards the most appropriate educational and professional pathways. However, especially in the case of humanitarian migrants, including innovative ways to assess formal learning is equally important, given that they usually lack certificates and proof of their previous studies. The tool will be designed to make it easier for refugees to describe their educational experience, and for service providers and job counsellors to assess their effective level of education.Finally, project REVaLUE will not limit itself to the creation of a skills assessment tool, but it will build on that experience to create two other products:- a CV certified by the project for all beneficiaries of the skills assessment process. To this end the REVaLUE CV will bear in the cover page a description of the project and the assessment process that led to the drafting of the CV. - The report \u201cWho migrates to Europe? Educational and professional profiles of refugees in EU countries\u201d. The report will collect the assessing experience of the 5 countries in which the project is carried out, trying to draw a picture of refugees in terms of education and professional experience.", "http://www.ashleyhousing.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA202-005445_4"], ["7HY", "Empowering teachers and trainers to cope with religious diversity and boost intercultural education in Europe", "ASDAN", 178594.0, "Europe is facing some major its major challenges since the end of the WWII. From the effects of the radicalization and the extremism, to the crisis of the refugees and the asylum seekers or the discrimination of some migrant communities, the question about how to foster the social cohesion and to fight against discrimination is in the middle of the debates in an increasingly culturally diversified Europe.Religion has come to a prime site in the cultural and social conflict, but religion is only one aspect among a range of factors which make migrants and ethnic minorities appear different. Policymakers throughout Europe feel increasing pressure to adopt more effective approaches to secure inclusion but are uncertain how to bring people together to achieve this. Ensuring inclusive education for all children and young people and empowering teachers so that they are able to take an active stand against all forms of discrimination and racism, are among the recommendations made by the European Commission.Religious and moral values area highly sensitive area. The religious dimension of intercultural education and intercultural education itself require specific kinds of teaching and learning approaches. Unlike some traditional approaches to intercultural education, these methods focus not on the link between the dominant culture and minority cultures, but instead on learning to live together. Therefore, the teaching approaches must be coherent with this specific reality and requires specific methods and tools. Young people are a particularly vulnerable group. Young newcomers (refugees, asylum seekers and migrants) should also get access to intercultural education and benefit from the acquisition of social, civic and intercultural competences, independently of the educational programme in which the may be enroll. B.LIVING project aims to empower teachers and trainers to cope with religious diversity and boost intercultural education in Europe, developing a new European dimension on intercultural education in school education and VET by addressing the religious diversity inherent to our multicultural societies, from the human rights and intercultural learning perspectives.To do so, seven partner organizations (Educational authorities, Schools and VET providers, companies and social partners) from six countries (Belgium, UK, Austria, Turkey, Greece and Spain) will work together to develop B.LIVING project, in order to define common strategies to address religious diversity and intercultural education in Europe. B.LIVING partners will:a) Identify skill gaps, educational factors and successful methodological approaches to deal with religious diversity in intercultural education. (IO1 State of the art report)b) Enhance the professional development of School and VET teachers and trainers facilitating the assessment, validation and recognition of learning outcomes for teaching Religious diversity and Intercultural competencies. (IO2 ECVET Training Curriculum)c) Elaborate useful resources to disseminate better understanding of different and innovative methodological approaches for handling religious diversity in positive and dialogical ways, in classroom and in non-formal and informal learning environments. (IO3 B.LIVING pedagogical Handbook)d) Design practical activities, based on the B.LIVING innovative pedagogical approach, to support VET teachers and trainers in the teaching of religious diversity and intercultural education, in formal, non-formal and informal settings. (IO4 B.LIVING professional Toolbox)e) Design and implement an innovative digital space and practical tools addressed to both educators and learners to raise awareness and develop knowledge on different elements related with religious diversity and intercultural competencies through interactive learning elements (IO5 B.LIVING  Training APPs and learning platform)The main target users of the project products are School and VET teachers and trainers. Final beneficiaries are School and VET students and learners.During the life time of B.LIVING project, the partnership will directly involve 94 School and VET teachers and trainers (28 partners staff / 36 experts involved / 30 target users in pilots), 150 School and VET students and learners (in pilots) and 520 stakeholders. A wider audience, of a minimum of 1.000 recipients, will be reached at local, regional, national and European level through the planned dissemination activities.B.LIVING shall improve the inclusive education in VET system by offering innovative approaches and contents.

However, while these statements are made with real intent the data suggests that a great deal more needs to be done if the barriers to employment for people living with disability are to be eliminated.Currently much good work is being done to enhance the training received by people living with disabilities so they have the skills required to contribute with the labour, but there is less work being done to prepare and support SMEs in their efforts to engage people with disabilities. There is a significant need to ensure that SMEs can face the directives with confidence if the changes for people living with disabilities are to take place.SupportAbility has been created in order to address the gap in resources that currently stops SMEs in the furniture industry being full contributors to the aims of the UNCRPD. Its core aim is to provide resources to ensure that people living with disability can secure long-term employment through SMEs being able to supply the support they require from within the workplace.To this end, the project seeks to gain access to available resources and construct new ones for SME Directors, HR Officers and other managers so they can access the information they need when employing people with disability. In addition, SupportAbility will be creating a curriculum and e-Learning platform for a VET course to train furniture industry employees to be workplace mentors for people living with disabilities, so their peers are ready to give their support as well, especially during the initial phase of transition when entering a new place of work.SupportAbility has six Partner organisations that bring their experience in working with the SMEs active in the furniture industries, implementing VET for these SMEs, advocating for people living with disability, creating e-Learning activities, and analysing social research. The Partners are based across four countries \u2013 UK, Spain, Portugal and Turkey.The method for the project is founded on providing five substantial outputs as resources that can assist in bringing about the results. These will include (1) a report on the current state of affairs for furniture industry SMEs in employing people living with disability with an analysis of their needs. (2) a database providing resources for SME managers that can assist them in employing people with disability. (3) A User Guide to assist them in navigating and applying the database (4) A curriculum for the training of mentors to support people living with disability in the workplace. (5) An e-Learning platform that can be integrated into the implementation of the mentor course. The work will follow in this order, with the work on each output informing the development of the next one. There will also be a set of learning activities that will be included in the curriculum element as an implementation of that curriculum for 12 furniture industry employees to train as mentors.The Partners will be making contact with over 100 different organisations from across the sectors where they are working and engaging with 350-450 participants in order to reach their objectives. The Participants will mainly, though not exclusively, come from the countries where a Partner is located. The participants will take part in surveys, learning activities, as well as other events. They will also be engaged with the work on the project's data-driven analysis of disability in the furniture industry, the gathering of available resources for SMEs and the development of the curriculum for the mentor training.For many SMEs, being able to have a defined strategy to deal appropriately with employees that may also have disabilities will be new. The SupportAbility Partners expect that within furniture industry SMEs, there will be a significant increase in their sense of initiative and entrepreneurship in their approach to recruitment. The outputs will exist to enable SMEs to move past seeing the disability in a candidate for employment so they can engage with them as part of a team while having the confidence to deal with any special needs systemically.Beyond the project's lifetime, SupportAbility can become an example of a practical implementation of the ethical position stated within international directives like UNCRPD and the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020. In this context, SupportAbility can bring an increased inter-regional and transnational cooperation between public authorities in their VET commitment on behalf of supporting SMEs seeking to maximise accessibility to their world of work in all its forms.", "http://www.searchlighter.org", "BFM LIMITED", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024414_5"], ["8BB", "The Career Guidance and Modular Training Programme Based on e-Learning Which Is Suitable and Available for Professional Competence of Furnishing", "Didac Limited", 205790.0, "Projemizin Genel Amac\u0131:E\u011fitim ve \u00f6\u011fretim ve i\u015f d\u00fcnyas\u0131 aras\u0131nda i\u015fbirli\u011fi ile \u00d6\u011frenmeyi, istihdam\u0131 ve i\u015f g\u00fcc\u00fc hareketlili\u011fini kolayla\u015ft\u0131rmak i\u00e7in beceri ve yeterliliklerin, \u00f6\u011frenim \u00e7\u0131kt\u0131lar\u0131n\u0131n onaylanmas\u0131 tan\u0131nmas\u0131 ve \u015feffafl\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 sa\u011flayarak ,Dijital \u00e7a\u011fla b\u00fct\u00fcnle\u015ftirilmi\u015f yenilik\u00e7i ve a\u00e7\u0131k e\u011fitim yoluyla Mesleki E\u011fitim M\u00fcfredat\u0131nda anahtar yeterlilikleri daha da g\u00fc\u00e7lendirmektir.Projemizin \u00f6zel ama\u00e7lar\u0131: E\u011fitim ve i\u015f ya\u015fam\u0131n\u0131n i\u015fbirli\u011fine dayal\u0131 olarak,\u201csistematik ve b\u00fct\u00fcnc\u00fcl\u201d bir yakla\u015f\u0131mlaMobilya D\u00f6\u015femecili\u011fi Mesleki Yeterliliklere uygun e\u011fitim m\u00fcfredat\u0131 ve Kariyer geli\u015fimi hizmetleri sunarak \u00f6\u011frencileri i\u015f g\u00fcc\u00fc piyasas\u0131nda istihdam\u0131n\u0131 sa\u011flamak ve Mobilya sekt\u00f6r\u00fcn nitelikli eleman ihtiyac\u0131n\u0131 kar\u015f\u0131lamak.Kurumsal Ar-ge yap\u0131s\u0131 olu\u015fturarak Mesleki E\u011fitimle sekt\u00f6r aras\u0131nda ulus\u00f6tesi i\u015fbirli\u011fine dayal\u0131 , kendi ayaklar\u0131 \u00fczerinde duran bir okul k\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc olu\u015fturarak kurumsal kapasiteyi geli\u015ftirmek.

On one hand none of them is actually stressing out on the video content and dissemination of VET information. \r\n\r\nThe \u201cVocational Guidance\u201d platform will offer unique instruments for fostering the VET partnerships and for offering a comprehensive channel for information of VET possibilities all over Europe.\r\n\r\nThe strategic partnership is established in accordance with the relevant and complementary competences of the selected partners.  The project will be developed in close cooperation of 7 partners from 4 countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, United Kingdom and Romania). All partners have joined the proposal because their experts have identified the need for development of Media platform, focused on VET guidance. Through the broad variance of the partners\u2019 institutional background, a successful implementation of the project on local, regional and European level is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe project main result is strengthened partnership between the VET actors - NEETs, educational institutions, teachers and trainers, business angels, networks and labor market actors, through established media platform.\r\n\r\nThe project will allow participating in the process of creating media platform experts to put their creativity and innovativeness. Collaboration and exchange of expertise between participants in the project will allow the upgrade of existing capacity in the field of VET. Last but not least in the process, will be built permanent partnerships for future initiatives and projects. Partner's organizations will strengthen their capacity and expertise in the field of promotion of VET.\r\nThe target groups of users of the platform will be able to use the most advanced and affordable media solutions by which to increase their efficiency, support the individual research and raise VET perceptions.

We expect that two target groups who will particularly benefit from improved workplace communication are D/deaf/hearing-impaired (D/deaf/HI) workers, and migrant workers. \r\n\r\nThis objective has been formulated around known needs, based on existing research policy, and is strongly aligned with Erasmus+ objectives and priorities. \r\n\r\nThe European Framework Directive 89/391 on Safety and Health at Work is a milestone in improving safety and health at work, which guarantees minimum safety and health requirements throughout Europe. Employers are therefore strongly motivated to ensure their employees' H&S in the workplace, and an easy way for all employees to communicate urgent messages, particularly in high-risk situations, will help to do this. It will also reduce employer's concerns about workplace communication issues, which should encourage an increase in the employment of D/deaf/HI people, and migrants, (acting on the horizontal priority of social inclusion). Furthermore, according to the Health and Safety Executive, manufacturing and construction are the industries with the highest rates of industrial deafness cases, and so employers who do not have systems in place for D/deaf/HI employees are likely to lose more experienced workers whose hearing becomes impaired over time. This further relates to the aging of the workforce, an issue raised in the EC's Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014-2020.\r\n\r\nThe project will create 4 intellectual outputs:\r\n\r\nO1 - Sign vocabulary\r\nAround 200 health and safety words and phrases, created in English by experts in manufacturing, health and safety and sign language, then transferred into a signed form (based on International Sign wherever possible). \r\n\r\nO2 - Online glossary\r\nGlossary with videos of all the sign vocabulary signs, with translation (and additional information where required) in English, British Sign Language, German, Austrian Sign Language, Italian and Italian Sign Language. \r\n\r\nO3 - E-learning resource\r\nOnline (desktop and mobile) e-learning resource with bite-sized, scenario-based learning activities, taking videos from the online glossary in order to teach the sign vocabulary. \r\n\r\nO4 - Guidelines for diversity in health and safety\r\nInformation on national health and safety qualifications, how the e-learning resource can be incorporated into VET providers' existing health and safety training courses, and information about how people with hearing impairment can specialise in a career in health and safety. \r\n\r\nPartners have identified eight groups of people from which participants can be recruited:\r\n\r\n- Employees with hearing impairment\r\n- Migrant employees\r\n- Employees with no hearing or language issues (they will also need to use the sign vocabulary if it is to become widespread)\r\n- Health and Safety experts and/or officers\r\n- Training Curricula developers\r\n- Human Resource policymakers\r\n- Social-inclusion activists\r\n- Health and Safety teachers\r\n\r\nThe ultimate impact that the project aims for is Increased access to employment for D/deaf/HI and migrant community.

Next to the second chance knowledge and quality centre a European online community \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently projects like EXACT, DEVOTED and LION contributed to the development of good teaching/learning practices and the development of competence based quality standards. This together with opening up of educational institutions towards employers and social service providers, made it possible to provide state-of-art opportunities for those in a disadvantaged position. Further in the guidance on the work place the projects EGUIDYA, EMYA, BEST and MOBILE were of high value to set standards that facilitate international placements and to sensitize employers and educational institutions regarding needs and opportunities on the work place.  World is changing fast: further impulses need to be given to the digital opportunities and the (European) community building in second chance education.

The developed tools (user-driven, online grading system for good practices; self- and peer-assessment system for organisations; tailor-made e-portfolio tool for (international) placements; self-assessment tool for teachers/trainers) will created the opportunity to think and act bordeless in European second chance education and upgrade national development to a European, transversal, setting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the development of the online knowledge and quality centre it is important that those involved in (the development of) training and taching processes contribute themselves and share ideas, knowledge and experiences. An online and offline European community of teachers/trainers in second chance education is targeted. In this community teachers and trainers can share, discuss, develop and value their  practices and ideas. In this way a bottom-up movement is started based on social network activity and user involvement.  The continuous  education of teachers and trainers is fostered making all teacher trainings in the second chance netwerk visible (connecting supply and demand) and by exploring good practices for joint (European) curriculum design and international guest lectures.

The Project's name is already providing information about its objectives by demanding an upgrading on the quality of e-Learning practices and simultaneously an enhancement on the number and characteristics of the Organizations and people to involve in e-Learning.\r\n\r\nPartners are aware of the common cross-borders barriers to e-Learning which had been previously identified by the partners. The barriers had been divided into three categories: \r\n- Access: the physical and technological infrastructures in which the learning occurs and through which the material is presented; the availability of appropriate learning resources; the social infrastructure in which the material is presented.\r\n- Stakeholders: learners, trainers and Organizations;\r\n- Course: contents and Pedagogy\r\n\r\nConsidering this barriers' ensemble, 'Better-E' proposes tools and methodologies to diminish them, providing solutions both from a technological and a pedagogical perspectives, surely considering and empowering the necessary (and also the most fragile) stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThe project Objectives are, among other:\r\n- to propose, to test and to create a user-friendly and pedagogy-centered e-Learning Platform for courses promotion;\r\n- to introduce and to incorporate e-Learning into Organizations (training provider NGOs, and other) usually not included into e-Learning practices;\r\n- to promote e-Learning as an inclusion device considering the fact that traditional Education and Training are regular social inclusion mechanisms but so far e-Learning is not;\r\n- to use e-Learning to encourage active citizenship and entrepreneurship through initiatives fostering green skills and entrepreneurial mind-sets and skills.\r\n\r\nThe Project will directly target two main groups (further applicable to an endless number and type of users): Training Provider NGOs and their targeted audiences. The philosophy sustaining it is the need to generate e-Learning best practices near Organizations into Adult Education and Training Systems but usually not into e-Learning. Engaging them into e-Learning will consequently benefit their target-groups by engaging them with the new set of social support offers available. The Project foresees the direct involvement of dozens of NGOs from the involved countries.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that the scientific, pedagogical and technological scopes of the deliverables are prepared and will be applicable to the entire range of e-Learning stakeholders, namely Schools, Universities, Training Provider Companies, among other.\r\n\r\nProject promoters will engage into a Preliminary Research to upgrade the state-of-arts within their contexts (Organizations, people, policies, Countries). They will then conceive, test and launch the 'Better-E Platform', an online tool to fully conceive e-Learning courses embedded of technological solutions and pedagogical concerns. In order to test the Platform and engage final-beneficiaries (NGOs and people), the Partnership proposes the conception, testing and deliver of 2 e-Learning courses: 'Entrepreneurship', promoting active citizenship and entrepreneurship and failing social exclusion cycles, and 'Easily Moving from Learning to e-Learning', an instruction course also teaching, but not restricted to, how to use the 'Better-E' Platform. During the entire process the Partnership will be committed with Dissemination activities and internal and external incorporation activities. Monitoring and Evaluation and Quality Assurance play an essential role through the entire Project cycle allowing the decision for the best inflection processes whenever needed.\r\n\r\nA participatory methodology is implemented in order to involve all the applicable stakeholders: promoters and users. The cycle of conceiving/testing/refining/launching requires the active involvement of final beneficiaries, generating mutual responsibility and ultimate ownership.\r\n\r\nTangible products to deliver are fostering strong intangible results: the enhancement of both the practice and the quality of e-Learning, the increasing of the number and type of e-Learning promoters and, above all, the problems for which better e-Learning practices can contribute with a solution. Not only Education and Training are foreseen as e-Learning scopes, 'Better-E' Project fosters Social Inclusion and Cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe chosen acronym, Better-E, reveals simultaneously this great concern towards the importance of better 'e-Learning', but is as well capable of providing additional interpretations of relevance in the current times: 'Better-E' may recall 'Better Europe', by means of strong European Partnerships contributing for better common societies; it may as well recall the English word 'Battery', symbolizing the strong energy of partners while developing the project together, making it aligned and responding to the Erasmus+ global priorities and aims.", "http://www.searchlighter.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA204-021954_7"], ["9LT", "onlinE PrOfessional Development in Second chance Education", "PHOENIX SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 273834.0, "In 2014 the DIgital Second Chance Opportunities (DISCO) Consortium was established with support funding from Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership as digital technology and education are evolving at an increasingly rapid pace, both separately and together. For example, there have been significant developments in new digital technology platforms such as mobile technologies, cloud computing, social media, open educational resources (OERs), free and open-source software (FOSS), as well as the associated hardware (e.g. mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, interactive whiteboards). Opportunities and demands of globalisation and technology are fuelling transformations of educational practices and school infrastructure quickly t. The evolution of educational systems and digital technology also provide additional challenges to framing our perspectives, including the emergence of virtual and networked schools that share courses and programmes within countries and across regions (Davis, Eickelmann & Zaka 2013). Utilising these technological advancements to support good-quality training and reflective professional development are fast becoming essential parts of a teacher\u2019s professional life. Supporting teachers in their professional development leads to improved outcomes for teachers, trainers and learners alike. In former projects many good tools were developed with great enthusiasm and piloted in the area of second chance education that supported teachers to become more confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged. The tools include competence cards, quality cycles, assessment software, evaluation methods, mobility practices, teaching programmes and mentor trainings alongside a number of other tools that supports the education and employability for the NEET-group  in Europe.  In 2014 the Digital Second Chance Opportunities (DISCO) project began building the foundations of an online European infrastructure framework in second chance education. Now it is time to go a step further by moving DISCO onto the next level of development in terms of its content and service delivery.  The online European infrastructure in second chance education will be built on three pillars:1. SERVICES: under the SERVICES-umbrella existing quality tools will be made available and continuously upgraded. These quality tools are partly developed for a) quality assurance of international placements b) online community building  c) quality assurance of educational organisations and d) good practice testing.2. RESOURCES: under the RESOURCES-umbrella existing good practices/resources will be made available. Curricula, methodologies, teaser practices, studies and other tools will be provided as a \u201cpick-of-the-shelve\u201d-concept. 3. TRAININGS: under the TRAININGS-umbrella training offers and demands are connected.In E-PODS focus is put on the elements of resources and trainings in secondchanceeducation.eu.

International Monetary Fund confirms in its report from 2015 that \u201cInvesting one euro in welcoming refugees can yield nearly two euros in economic benefits within 5 years\u201d. \r\n\r\nHowever, this group is particularly vulnerable and require targeted support at the beginning. They generally arrive with weak, if any attachment or link to the host country and have gained qualifications and work experience in very different labour market conditions. On EU average, it takes between five and six years to integrate more than 50 % of humanitarian migrants into the workplace and as much as 15 years to reach a 70 % employment rate converging towards the outcomes for labour migrants (European Parliament). Long periods of inactivity also lead to demotivation and deskilling; deskilling in turns means that they could only accept low-skilled jobs, remaining trapped in a low socioeconomic cycle. This impacts on their willingness and resilience to effectively commit to their integration. Moreover, low-skilled refugees are even more negatively affected than other migrants and they are left to find their own way in societies with high labour market threshold (European Council). \r\n\r\nThe corrective action of ARIVE will strive to tackle all major causes that prevent refugees\u2019 integration to boost levels of integration in communities, namely:\r\n- Lack of recognition of knowledge, competence and skills, including previous studies;\r\n- Deskilling and social isolation;\r\n-Lack of working experience in the host country and peer networks at a suitable professional/ vocational level;\r\n- Language and understanding of the civic and social landscape.\r\n\r\nThe general objective of the project is to develop quality learning opportunities in order to encourage low-qualified and low-skilled humanitarian migrants to assess and upskill their competences in order to enter the labour market at early stages. This integration shall be facilitated taking into consideration the individual needs/capacities and labour market demand. \r\n\r\nTo this end the project will:\r\n\u2022 facilitate the recognition of formal, non-formal and informal knowledge, competences and skills of refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through the design and implementation of a toolkit for integration skills assessment to enable signposting to suitable peer support groups; \r\n\u2022 transfer new qualifying skills to refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through tailored courses that meet their specific learning needs and characteristics, in particular the language and digital skills; \r\n\u2022 provide refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers with hands-on experience through the creation and implementation of work-based laboratories facilitated by refugee support groups.\r\n\r\nThe target group of ARIVE will be refugees/subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers recently arrived to Europe. The project will address mostly (but not exclusively) low-skilled refugees. Female migrants will be given special consideration, integrating a gender approach in the design and implementation of project\u2019s products. Although the beneficiaries of the action are constituted by humanitarian migrants only, the project\u2019s products will be applicable to other kinds of migrants as well.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \u201crefugee crisis\u201d is a phenomenon that is involving Europe as a whole, therefore, any action addressing this phenomenon should be carried out transnationally. Moreover, when they are granted protection, refugees often move to other countries and it is useful to have common tools and procedures for refugees\u2019 skills assessment and training methodologies.  The action is in line with the recommendations of the international community. In its \u201cNote on the integration of refugees in the European Union\u201d (2007), UNCHR states that host communities should facilitate the development of refugees\u2019 language and vocational skills and assist them in pursuing employment.

However young drivers typically represent between 18% and 30% of all killed drivers, although people in the same age group only represent between 9% and 13% of the total populations in their countries. Traffic crashes are the single greatest killer of 15-24 year-olds in OECD countries and within European countries, among 15-24 year olds, the majority of road fatalities are car occupants (59%) or motorcyclists (19%. Young drivers pose a greater risk than other drivers to themselves, their passengers and other road users, socially and economically excluded young people being highly represented in accident statistics.  Research has indicated that inexperienced drivers, particularly  young male drivers, tend to fall into the category of high risk threshold drivers. These drivers tend to have a particular set of attitudes that are associated with their lifestyles and driving culture. Risk taking  is  perceived  as  a normal part of driving as young people  tend  to  have  higher  sensation  seeking tendencies. This all has a huge economic and social cost on societies\r\n Improving traffic safety and reducing crashes and resulting deaths and injuries is a fundamental objective of the E-DRIVERS project as it aims to address the high levels of young driver risk by taking into account some of the highly complex root causes of the problem which include inexperience, age, gender , physiological and emotional development, personality, social norms and individuals\u2019 socio-economic circumstances.

Without one element in place, not only will have the socio-economic integration process have failed for the individual but it could also result in long-term instability, community isolation and general lack of social participation on a range of levels for the individual. A key reason for this failure is ultimately the language barriers that exist for refugees throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nThe SEESI project\u2019s main objective is to resolve a fault to the socio-economic integration process through mobilising a unique 'Life(skills) before Language' (LBL) approach to the language barrier that refugees and migrants experience upon arrival in Europe. Through developing the skill-sets of \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Workers, who are often the first contact point, refugees and migrants meet in their new host country, the SEESI project aims to revolutionize the socio-economic integration process throughout Europe. The SEESI project aims to design a unique training LBL framework and curriculum which will change Support Workers role from helpful members of refugees/migrants own community into a new dynamic job role, responsible for an essential progression route for new refugees/migrants entering Europe and the local community and ultimately the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, currently provides advice and guidance to refugees and migrants, in their mother tongue language, which often provides key information to these groups. Furthermore, official Refugee Support Workers, Employment Advisers, Counsellors, Integration Advisers, as well as local municipality staff depend greatly on the work Support Workers do especially in interpreting and language support. By developing the skill-set of the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, from basic advice to targeted socio-economic integration service, the role will become more formalised, increase skill-set and will be able to offer targeted support which will ultimately support refugees and migrants integration.\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker will develop training, mentoring and teaching skill-sets alongside their wider community support role, which will ensure that refugees and humanitarian migrants also have the opportunity to develop their skills, knowledge, and wider competences from day one of entering their new host countries. This alternative strategy, Life before Language, will result in refugees and humanitarian migrants gaining the Labour Market skills they require, while learning their host countries\u2019 language on a parallel basis. Rather than the current format where a refugee and humanitarian migrant can only develop civic, social and labour market skills once they have gained a basic level of their host countries\u2019 language. This revolutionary strategy offers a fast track approach of Refugee integration and all through the development of the Support Worker role through the SEESI project.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI project will achieve this through the creation of 6 innovative intellectual outputs designed to increase the Adult Education sector\u2019s knowledge on integration issues, while formalising a unique training methodology aimed at developing the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker creating the future dynamic Refugee Support Workers. Alongside a training curriculum, the SEESI project partners will create Community-based Train the Trainer manual and guidance, offering accessible guidelines on how to deliver the SEESI Support Worker training programmes to volunteers and staff, as well as launching the SEESI outputs on a digital learning platform. Finally a SEESI EU-level guide will be produced on the benefits of mobilisation the SEESI socio-economic integration strategy to revolutionise the future of European-level integration.", "http://www.ach.org.uk", "ASHLEY COMMUNITY & HOUSING LTD", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA204-048075_coordinator"], ["9LT", "Alianco: Conocimientos Competitivos", "PHOENIX SOCIAL ENTERPRISE LIMITED", 16110.0, "Our project will be developed in Ciudad Real, where the organizing entity (Cocemfe Oretania) is located.\r\nCocemfe Oretania is a Non-Governmental Non-Profit Organization whose objective is to bring together, strengthen, train and coordinate the efforts and activities of provincial entities and associations that work for people with disabilities to defend their rights and improve their quality of life.\r\nWith more than 20 years of experience collaborating in projects of employment integration, training, leisure and inclusive sport, etcetera; we seek to continue expanding our knowledge in order to provide a better quality of service to our users.\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n-> Improve our capacities as an entity to enhance our improvement, offering a service in favor of the social equality by offering an improved service, with extended  knowledge and contrasted with other entities in the European Union.\r\n-> To offer our users the opportunity to improve, to eliminate the obstacles that are presented to them at a cultural and formative level, which in turn are reflected in a context that is economically and socially disadvantaged.\r\nThese will be done through:\r\n-An analysis of our weaknesses and strengths in our areas of work: employment integration, training, health care and inclusive leisure.\r\n-An analysis of the search for solutions to the problems faced by people at risk of social exclusion at an international level.\r\nAs the first project at European level that we present, we want to carry out a small collaboration between five countries of the European Union.\r\nWe will have the participation of five entities from different countries, thus promoting intercultural exchange between different entities of the European Union. The profile of the collaborators will be: entities of the European Union, with interest in the social inclusion of people at risk of social exclusion, entities that share the philosophy and principles of our entity. Employees must have the necessary professional skills and qualifications to carry out the proposed action.\r\nThe development of the collection of information and compilation of the analysis will be carried out periodically, arranging periodic personal or virtual contact monthly to carry out a final compilation to the fifth month and its dissemination in conferences in which all the entities will participate.\r\nAs research, it will be carried out in a cooperative way between all the entities, the final result would be the presentation of a Guide that will show an analysis of the current situation of young people with disabilities in the corresponding countries. It will be presented at conferences where the participating countries will gather to disseminate the results of the study and the knowledge and skills acquired, promoting dialogue and participation.\r\nThe expected result of this collaboration is to be able to participate, through an analysis of the entities and the work with our users, in the integration of young people and groups at risk of social exclusion in order to provide improvements; provide, through our entity, a more multicultural and European environment in our region; expanding the future participation of more entities and more european youngs to our projects.\r\nWith regard to our entity, we would like to make an internal reflection to analyze our weaknesses and strengths in all areas. After this analysis, we hope to be able to carry out improved, more open actions, and count on the development of innovative and sustainable ideas as a consequence.\r\nIn relation to the target groups, we would expect an improvement in personal, educational and cultural skills in general, making progress in eliminating the obstacles to social exclusion.\r\nIn addition, for our users, young people with problems of social inclusion, an improvement in the competencies of the entity will be a benefit that would lead to socio-cultural improvement and even economic progress for the future.\r\nIn addition, as an entity in favor of persons with disabilities, we would like to implement the learning learned from the collaboration with other European entities and convey the philosophy of the organization to encourage people with disabilities to put into practice the principles of full social participation with equal opportunities, guaranteeing the promotion of rights, autonomy and independent living, integration and standardization, universal accessibility, respect for diversity and the gender perspective and quality of life.", "http://www.phoenixsocialenterprise.com", null, "erasmus_2017-3-ES02-KA205-010573_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS5"}
