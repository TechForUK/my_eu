This vocational training period has to be completed in order to pass the European standard BTECH diploma in Cookery and Catering, and provides the students with a mobility opportunity abroad, an opening into European Multicultural Citizenship and development of their vocational and linguistic skills. These students, who are registered in the second year of the three year European B Tech, in the Cookery, Service and Restaurant modules have already undertaken a first year Vocational BTECH. They comprise 2 classes of 24 students.  The first group will go to work placements in Europe in September 2014, the second group will have their training period in March - April 2015, The next class, of 48 students, will be divided in half so 24 will be sent in September - October 2015 and the others 24 in March - April 2016. In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee. The budget is established taking into account Erasmus funding, the contribution of partner companies, the Lyc\u00e9e, family and a financial grant from the Region Ile de France. The activities and results of the project are widely disseminated in newspapers, and websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 2: Consists of a 5 month European mobility which is suitable for students who have just passed a diploma in the Cookery and Catering sector and having now a CAP, a Vocational B TECH or a Technology BTECH. They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation. To be able to finance this invaluable learning project we depend on the contribution from Europe - the share of the ERASMUS + grant being only 28.4% of the total budget. The participation of the European Union remains vital for the sustainability and success of the programme.", "http://www.peebleshotelhydro.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA102-000990_15"], ["9BE", "Primary Language Learning", "Priorsford Primary School", 11628.0, "This application is to provide funding for 5 teachers to participate in an immersion course in France, to enable them to successfully deliver a language progamme to children from Nursery to Primary 7 and so begin to embed the target language into the school curriculum.\r\nThis application is also to provide funding for 3 teachers to participate in an immersion course in Spain, to enable the school to embark on the journey of introducing and delivering the teaching of a 3rd language in the upper stages of primary level. \r\nThese 2 projects are in line with the Scottish Government's 1+2  initiative, which requires all primary schools in Scotland, to introduce the teaching of modern languages into their curriculum by 2020. This project also supports our School Development Plan over the next 5 years.\r\nOne of the teachers , who wishes to develop the 3rd language within the school, has attended a 'Train the Trainer' course for modern languages and is now involved in developing a language programme for the authority and in training other teachers within the cluster. It is hoped that other teachers who attend this course, will be drafted in to support the roll out of languages across our region.\r\nThe course activities provided by LFEE Europe  will allow participants to converse in the target languages, improving their own language skills and cultural awareness. It will also equip them with new resources, ideas and cross-curricular approaches, taking into consideration all types of learners, kinesthetic, auditory and visual. There will be a focus on the 4 skills -Listening, Talking, Reading and Writing. Taking a cross curricular approach, will help us embed the target language into daily routines. As well as increasing cultural awareness of the countries of the target languages and improving their own personal language skills, teachers will gain knowledge of how best to use the internet , ICT and other forms of media to support language learning. The courses offered by LFEE Europe are delivered by native speakers, who are teachers themselves and who have experience in teaching in Scottish schools and understand the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence. LFEE Europe offer on-going support to teachers, both prior to and after the course has finished. The content of these courses will build on the progress in languages we have already made as a school and increase the confidence and skill set of our teachers in delivering a language. Teachers will be given every opportunity to share their learning and resources with all staff in school on their return. Provision will also be made to ensure other teachers across our region will benefit from their expertise, enabling as many pupils in our region to access modern languages.\r\nAs a result of our teachers attending these immersion courses, we ultimately aim to to promote the enjoyment of learning a foreign language within our school and beyond, raising awareness of the importance of being able to communicate with others within the ever increasing global society in which we live. Forming links and partnerships with schools across Europe, through collaborative projects fostering tolerance, mutual understanding and appreciation of the cultures of others, will lay down foundations for the future for our young learners, tomorrow's global citizens.", "http://www.priorsfordprimary.com", "Priorsford Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013188_coordinator"], ["8PL", "Go and Meet Europe", "Cringletie House Hotel Limited", 110869.0, "This time 68 students are registered to participate in a 12-month compulsory internship abroad (according to this school\u2019s curriculum) \u2013 period of this project: June to September 2016. Three of the students are from the fashion department. As our students are trained in modern languages, we have chosen the following countries for the internship: Italy, France, Malta, Ireland, Spain and Great Britain. Our students will be trained in theory (language skills) and in practice beforehand. Additionally, they will be supported by the Erasmus+ team (contact via WhatsApp/facebook) during the internship.After the internship an evaluation will be carried out by the partner hotel. Means of evaluation will be the ECVET \u2013 form and the Learning Agreement.Students are encouraged to gain further practical knowledge and skills in hotel industry which have already been provided in theory in order to be well-prepared for their future working life. Therefore our students should be given the possibility to work in fields like:restaurant, reception, bar, administration, room service, housekeeping, concierge, seminar and conference area. From our point of view, there will be a noticeable increase in the employability because of the internship.Besides improving their practical skills, our trainees should strengthen their social skills and their self-confidence (personal capabilities), which means that responsibility, independency, self-confidence, ability to work on their own, team spirit, ability to listen, friendliness, ability to communicate with their superiors, colleagues and guests. Moreover, our students should encounter the differences of various cultures and traditions and their characteristics to develop an open-minded tolerance.Another important aim is to improve language skills. Students should be able to use their acquired language skills in order to broaden their communication skills in daily work life.Furthermore, we would like to stress that the sense of belonging to the European Union should be created and increased to make the EU be realized as a chance for personal and professional development. Employing foreign students in their hotels, people show interest in different nationalities and also in the willingness to train and support the young. This will be documented by using the following tools: Letter of Intent, Learning Agreement, Personal Transcript, Europass and ECVET. The hotel is not only a working but also learning place.We are primarily looking for hotels in the 4 or 5 stars category to ensure a high standard not only concerning the working but also the learning conditions. In cooperation with the Erasmus+ Team the students work out tasks of the Learning Agreement and the results will be discussed. Teachers will visit their students at their hotels to deepen the personal contact and to assure the quality of the internship.For school, this project is evidence of a professionally grounded education, which will finally be documented by annual reports, parents\u2019 evening, Erasmus+ Day, personal diary entries of the participants as well as broadcasts in the media (local TV, newspapers, websites).The aspired project goals are assured by a professional quality management team (G. Malle, B. Potz, M-A. Schwarz) and teachers working in the fields of economy and modern languages.ECVET elements will be used to emphasize comparison and sustainability of the project. Using these tools, the cooperation with the hotels will be intensified. That\u2019s why increased action of the accompanying teachers will be necessary especially at the beginning.Apart from the EU aspect, long-term impacts on the participant, school site and the Austrian educational system are stressed. Our participants will be able to profit from their work experience in the long run, school site will face an enhancement of the public image and finally, it has to be mentioned that these projects are vital for the Austrian educational system to broaden the horizon of the participants in order to appreciate the importance of the EU.", "http://www.cringletie.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016376_17"], ["8LX", "MOBILITE EUROPEENNE DANS LE SECTEUR DE L'HOTELLERIE ET DE LA RESTAURATION", "Peebles Hotel Hydropathic", 203162.0, "The project of our catering school insists on the importance of our European partner network and is historically oriented to Europe and the International destinations.

The aim of this exchange is to foster the relationship and interaction of youngsters living in Hendaye and its twin-towns, while working on a common topic. For the youth exchange, a partnership between following associations/municipalities has been created: AJD Deao from Viana de Castelo (Portugal), Nomad Beat from Peebles (Scotland) and the municipalities of Arguedas (Spain) and Hendaye (France). The exchange will take place in Hendaye from Saturday 21st of July to Saturday 28th of July 2018. Our target are youngsters aged between 18-25 years, summing up to 28 participants in total (4 groups of 7 participants). The exchange is accessible to all youngsters, no matter their level of education or socio-cultural origins.\r\n\r\nThe project is entitled \u201cEurope for Minors\u201d (original French title: \u201cSol majEur pour minEur\u201d), as the red threat of the exchange concerns the situation of unaccompanied minors migrating to Europe. The content has been divided into three phases: first of all, the reasons that push minors to leave their home country, secondly, the dangers and risks regarding their journey, and finally, the difficulties they might face once in Europe. Furthermore, participants will receive information about international conventions concerning the rights of men and children and, additionally, the mobility options proposed by Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nIn the months ahead of the exchange, every group conducts a research about the situation of unaccompanied minors in their own city/country. During the exchange, all participants are invited to actively participate in debates and round table discussions where they can share and exchange their opinion. With the aim of accurately tackling the subject, different learning methods will be alternated throughout the exchange: individual preparation, assemblies allowing the encounter with professionals, excursions to venues where unaccompanied minors are being received, documentaries etc. The exchange will also propose moments of social encounters and animations: games, intercultural evenings, social dinners, official receptions and cultural excursions. Besides, we intend to execute our project according to the framework of sustainable development: recycling, waste management, site visit of natural areas etc. Finally, a blog will facilitate the communication and retention of the work done during the youth exchange. By means of a blog, the shared information will remain easily accessible even once the participants have returned home.\r\n\r\nConcerning evaluation, a continuous and collaborative assessment of the achieved work will take place.

Enriques (Castelfiorentino, Italy) and Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium Ostfildern (Ostfildern, Germany). It is aimed at general and vocational students aged 15-18.\r\n  \r\nWe see the need for increasing the speaking skills and oral proficiency of our students so that they are enabled to prove their qualifications in European standardised tests. Test results have shown that foreign language classroom teaching often enables students to achieve  adequate levels in the understanding and in the writing part of standardised exams, but that they fall behind in the speaking part.  \r\n\r\nWe want to achieve higher language proficiency in cooperation with language test institutions and with members from The English Academy (TEA), a language educator think tank in Giessen.  We will work together via the e-twinning platform, in online video conferences and in intercultural project meetings. \r\n\r\nWe will adapt existing didactic material, but we will lay emphasis on our students creating material like games, phrase cards and 'speaking prompts' for each other because this makes them personally involved in the topics. They identify more closely with the speaking situations and their context. \r\nWhen creating a pair of 'speaking prompts' for the topic of 'health vs. drugs, alcohol, smoking', they will follow the requirements for the Speaking Part of European language exams, and create two A4 sheets with their own photos presenting different situations, and with opposing statements/quotations. This material will be used in the foreign language classrooms in our schools and will prepare the topics for the meetings. \r\n\r\nIn order to create plurilingual speaking opportunities in CLIL-like surroundings, the students' meetings are organised as workstays. The first day of each meeting will be consecrated to a language workshop so that students are familiarised with the host country's language and introduced to the workstay. English will be the communication language in this project and the language used on e-twinning and in publications. \r\n\r\nThe level aimed for in the final language tests depends on the years of teaching and ranges from B1 to B2/C1, whereas the other country languages reach levels from basic/A1 to A2/B1/B2. During the workstays English will be used at B1/B2 level, with specific terms (Fachsprache English). \r\n\r\nThe workcamp in Germany, at the industrial control and automation company FESTO in Esslingen, will deal with mechanics, electronics and engineering; the work stay in Finland will include schools and sports facilities enlarging the topics of education, sports and health. The science work stay in Scotland deals with sciences and ecological topics like pollution and global warming; the workstay in Italy with agriculture and  tourism. The final workstay in Estonia deals with media, surveillance and future work places. \r\n\r\nAll these topics are relevant for the speaking parts of European standardised exams at B1, B2/C1 levels and should be achieved in English. The aim for the other languages is that students can speak about themselves, their family, their hobbies, favourite food, holidays and plans for their future to various degrees (basic to A1/A2), so that they feel confident to take language exams and feel at home in intercultural surroundings, and feel prepared to work in the EU-wide job market.\r\n\r\nWe will  document the speaking situations which we create with the help of the experts from The English Academy (TEA). \r\nIn order to experience the learners' viewpoint and to live lifelong learning, some of the teachers will prepare for language tests alongside with students and take them. \r\n\r\nWe will evaluate the project and publish our findings in the DVD \"STEPs taken - What we have achieved\".

In Finland students will be required to stage a panel discussion revolving around political participation of young people. In Estonia, students will be provided with the opportunity to create a website with short documentary film clips, providing information on the smart and sustainable use of energy. In Italy, students will also produce a website including podcasts, focusing on the topic \"Immigration and concepts of integration\". The project work in Scotland is supposed to result in a panel discussion integrating Skype about young people entering the world of work. Students will work on these projects, complying with the methodology of project management. All final project products will be made available to a wider public at the end of each learning, teaching and training activity.\r\n\r\nThe final products will also be documented on eTwinning. Furthermore, students will be expected to keep a record of their project management activities in form of a (online) logbook. On top, we plan to present our good-practice examples of international project work in form of a compilation of brochures, each of which will be produced by students in the course of our five transnational meetings. Teaching material to support the students carry out their projects will also be made available as OER.\r\n\r\nAfter each learning, teaching and training activity, the newly acquired project management techniques and tools are applied in the home schools and follow-up project activities will be documented, adding to the success of the project.\r\n\r\nSurveys at the beginning and at the end of the entire project and of each transnational learning, teaching and training activity will ensure the progress of the project.\r\n\r\nStudents and teachers will enormously profit from experiencing different approaches to project work in an international environment.
