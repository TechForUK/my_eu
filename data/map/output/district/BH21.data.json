Selling service contract impose to the dealers to guarantee the best level of services when it comes to maintain customer vehicles. Dealers must avoid, as far as possible, unplanned stop to happen and consequently guarantee to the customer an optimal availability of his vehicles. On a customer perspective, the service contract is a guarantee he will keep a constant level of performance when using his vehicle in his day-by-day business. Moreover, it also represents an important source of expenses. For the vehicle manufactures to ensure a cer-tain level of vehicle uptime, it is necessary to have precise knowledge of the vehicle health state and to minimize the immobilization time in case of a breakdown. New researches results in the field of condition monitoring and prediction of remaining life time of vehicle components will give an accurate image of the vehicle health status. This information can result in a dynamic maintenance planning, maintenance on the fly and repair on the fly. Research activities in the field of capturing work loads and operational constraints will be used to analyze vehicle configuration, operating conditions and vehicle usage. That will be beneficial to develop new sales offers. Progressively \u201cmobility\u201d offers should replace \u201cservice contract\u201d based on the combination of hard products (vehicle configuration) and relevant soft products (services). The system will be able to balance adequate between the current offer and the vehicle data feedback and analysis. The vehicle aftermarket sales are one of the major sources of revenue for the vehicle manu-factures today.

If they are unable to achieve targets, then this may have a significant negative impact on manufacturers. Cars also produce emissions such as Nitrogen oxides, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide and particulate matter which are subject to tight controls. For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies. As a result, a disruptive technology step is required that will enable the manufactures or cars and marine engines to meet the forthcoming legislative standards. One very attractive way of achieving this is to generate power from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) waste heat.\nA prototype system created by BMW can generate up to 250W of electricity under normal driving conditions that can cut fuel consumption by up to 2%. However, the thermo-electric materials used for these applications to date have a number of clear limitations as they can be easily thermally damaged, are expensive and only achieve low efficiencies.\nThe POWER DRIVER project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the production of an automotive and marine power generation system by integrating cutting-edge nano-structured silicide and functionally graded telluride thermo-electric materials into a heat exchanger assembly that will enable electrical power to be generated from the exhaust system without affecting back-pressure or engine balance. By doing this, the exhaust system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user.

While it has long been known that waste heat can be converted into energy the efficiency of early thermoelectric power generation systems was so low that it limited their applications.\n\nThermoelectric generators are essentially devices designed to convert heat directly into electricity using two materials and a temperature gradient. The greater the temperature difference between the 'hot' side and the 'cold' side the greater the power that can be produced.\n\nWithin the http://www.powerdriver.info/ (POWER DRIVER) project the focus was to design thermoelectric generators that could be mass produced for use in automotive waste heat recovery.\n\nSpecifically, two small thermoelectric generators have been designed: one based on silicide materials and another on telluride materials. Silicide and lead telluride (Pb/Te) based materials were synthesised and then processed using spark plasma sintering to produce thermo-electric materials with performance comparable to that found in the literature.\n\nThe thermoelectric devices have been integrated with control and power electronics. The most suitable solution was selected for mounting onto a hot air testrig where the exhaust of a 2litre gasoline car was simulated to establish its performance. This, in addition to estimated manufacturing and selling costs, was used to evaluate the new technology's commercial attractiveness.\n\nOnce completed the POWER DRIVER system will extract waste heat from the exhaust that will deliver direct current electrical power to the vehicle electrical system and thus reduce the alternator demand giving improved fuel efficiency by as much as 5 %.", null, "http://www.halyard.eu.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/148548.jpg", "fp7_102258_961634430"], ["2BJ", "GAlileo-Glonass Advanced Receiver INtegration", "Cobham Cts Limited", "The GAGARIN project is about the development of a GNSS receiver for aeronautical applications in the Russian Federation.

Glonass is expected to use the same modulation scheme as GPS and Galileo, to ease interoperability of future receivers. In this context, the EU-funded project 'Galileo-Glonass advanced receiver integration' (Gagarin) designed a receiver for aeronautic applications that would streamline aviation significantly.\n\nThrough intensive industrial collaboration among key players in Europe and Russia, the project worked diligently with antenna and receiver suppliers to design a new, more powerful receiver. The synergy would enable aviation stakeholders in Russia to adopt the same technology as Europe, contributing to the standardisation of GNSS solutions. It would also open doors to EU-Russian industrial cooperation on many levels.\n\nThe project studied regulatory, political, technical and market issues on the use of civil aviation GNSS receivers in Russia. It proposed innovative solutions to upgrade from what is known as a dual-constellation receiver to a triple-constellation receiver. This required advanced software algorithms, novel antenna design and new technology that were tested in a prototype receiver to demonstrate technical feasibility, yielding the world's first triple-constellation radio frequency signal simulator.\n\nWhile more efforts are needed to encourage development of common Galileo-Glonass standards, progress so far has opened the door to developing a viable multi-constellation receiver product for civil aviation applications. If the technology is fully exploited it will be able to handle air traffic much better, increase air traffic safety and contribute to reduction of emissions.
