Consequently, the potential for exposure to humans and the environment is likely to increase. Human exposure to MNMs and environmental release of these materials can occur during all the life cycle stages of these materials. For each stage of the life cycle of an MNM, exposure scenarios will need to be developed that effectively describe how exposure to humans and the environment occur and what measures are required to control the exposure. The aim of the NANEX project is to develop a catalogue of generic and specific (ocupational, consumer and environmental release) exposure scenarios for MNMs taking account of the entire lifecycle of these materials. NANEX will collect and review available exposure information, focussing on three very relevant MNMs: (1) high aspect ratio nanomaterials - HARNs) (e.g. carbon nanotubes); (2) mass-produced nanomaterials (e.g. ZnO, TiO2, carbon black); and (3) specialised nanomaterials that are currently only produced on a small scale (e.g Ag)). The exposure information will include both quantitative (measurement results) and qualitative contextual exposure information (risk management measures). We will also review the applicability of existing models for occupational and consumer exposure assessment and for environmental release from these scenarios. We will carry out a small number of specific case illustrations and carry out a gap analyses of the available knowledge and data. Finally, we project knowledge will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders, taking into account other relevant activities that are taking place in this field.", 22177.0, 868698.0, "NANEX", null, null, null, "http://nanex-project.eu/", null, null, "fp7_94285_997928047"], ["3QT", "Elimination of NOx, SOx and Particulates in Rail Transportation", "Osprey Corporation Limited", "Locomotive engines are significant contributors to air pollution in many cities and ports. Although locomotive engines being produced today must meet relatively modest emission requirements set in 1997, they continue to emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (PM).\nThe 2008 Clean Air Non-road Diesel Rule stipulates new requirements for non-road diesel fuel that will decrease the allowable levels of sulphur in fuel used in locomotives by 99 percent. These fuel improvements will create immediate and significant environmental and public health benefits by reducing PM from existing engines. The rule also establishes long-term, Tier 4, standards for newly-built engines based on the application of high-efficiency catalytic aftertreatment technology, beginning in 2015.\nAlthough established Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) processes appear effective, there remain several problems such as high reaction temperatures, which sometimes require reheating of the flue gas, a large reactor volume, and the need for reductant ammonia. In addition, the process is not applicable to NO in low concentrations and at ambient temperature. As NO2 is easily removed by water, catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 at a low temperature is a promising way of removing NO in flue gas without using ammonia.\nIn the ENSPIRIT project, the core research work will focus on the production of a pre-production prototype catalytic device for NO oxidation over Activated Carbon at ambient temperature. The catalytic device will be integrated into a system of combined devices for the removal of heat, moisture, Sulphur oxides, ultrafine particulate matter and Nitrogen oxides.

However, some of these properties, especially their surface reactivity, have raised health concerns, which have prompted scientists, regulators, and industry to seek consensus protocols for the safe production and use of the different forms of ENP. There is currently a shortage of field-worthy, cost-effective ways - especially in real time - for reliable assessment of exposure levels to ENP in workplace air. In addition to the problems with the size distribution, a major uncertainty in the safety assessment of airborne ENP arises from the lack of knowledge of their physical and chemical properties, and the levels of exposure. A special challenge of ENP monitoring is to separate ubiquitous background nanoparticles from different sources from the ENP. Here the main project goal is to develop innovative concepts and reliable methods for characterizing ENP in workplace air with novel, portable and easy-to-use devices suitable for workplaces. Additional research objectives are (1) identification of relevant physico-chemical properties and metrics of airborne ENP; establishment of reference materials; (2) exploring the association between physico-chemical and toxicological properties of ENP; (3) analyzing industrial processes as a source of ENP in workplace air; (4) developing methods for calibration and testing of the novel devices in real and simulated exposure situations; and (5) dissemination of the research results to promote the safe use of ENP through guidance, standards and education, implementing of safety objectives in ENP production and handling, and promotion of safety related collaborations through an international nanosafety platform.", 606056.0, 10506224.0, "NANODEVICE", null, null, null, "http://www.nano-device.eu", null, null, "fp7_90995_997928047"], ["3QT", "A novel vision based orchard system to maximize fruit tree yields and Class 1 quality by 20% whilereducing waste by 50%", "Fruition Po Limited", "The overall innovation project is intended to bring our novel \u2018OrchardMan\u2019 vision-based tree-fruit measurement technology to European market-readiness.
