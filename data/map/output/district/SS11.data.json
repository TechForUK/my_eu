To manage this transition healthcare policies in the EU and individual Member States are heavily focussed on extending the independent life of the elderly, with the dual aim of increasing their quality of life and reducing the costs of care. Dementia affects more than 6% of people aged 60\\ and has a devastating effect on their independence \u2013 to date, there is no proven intervention to help dementia patients live a fulfilling life for longer.\n\nIn this project we will build on an innovative patient support tool to develop a mHealth application that is specifically targeted to patients with mild dementia. The tool will help patients to adhere to their treatment and share data with their carers and doctors; carers will use the same application to monitor patients more easily and share their own well-being with doctors. This will slow the patients\u2019 cognitive and functional decline, avoid carers getting exhausted and reduce costs of emergency care.\n\nOur project will comprise two phases: first we will use digital accessibility tools to re-design the existing application for dementia patients. The development will be steered by patients, carers and doctors, through user-centric design: we will collect feedback on each new version of the application until the design is perfectly adapted to the users\u2019 needs. In the second phase we will pilot the optimised application with 1,100 users (patients \\ carers) and 1,100 controls. This will show the clinical and social benefits for patients and carers, as well as financial benefits for the healthcare system.\n\nSuccessful delivery of the pilot will increase patients\u2019 adherence to treatment (10 %-points), while improving the quality of life of carers and patients. It will save healthcare providers \u20ac1,818 / patient / year in care costs and will generate revenue of over \u20ac18 million / year for the consortium (Year 5).", 65134.0, 3201372.0, "SMART4MD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194061_951925118"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8HE", "European Professional Development", "HEARTS Academy Trust", 21801.0, "The HEARTS Academy Trust comprises of 4 schools, an infant faith school and 3 primary schools.  All schools are in areas of deprivation, with 1 having a population of 54% receiving Pupil Premium Grant (PPG).  Two of the schools have pupils with over 40% receiving PPG.  One is a small rural school which is isolated geographically.  Many of the pupils are from the nationally recognised disadvantaged group of White British Boys and now we are seeing an influx of refugees who have English as an Additional Language (EAL).  Although two of our schools are rated 'Good' by Ofsted they are vulnerable with a mobile population.  The Ofsted Report for Briscoe in July 2014 noted the necessity to close the gap for disadvantaged pupils:\r\n\r\n\"Pupils supported through the pupil premium are making accelerated progress.  Although at the end of Year 6 in 2013 the gap in attainment compared to their peers was over a year in reading, 18 months in writing and four months in mathematics.\"\r\n\r\nAs part of our School Improvement Plan we intend to send the School Improvement Team of 8 to Poland to research and analyse how disadvantaged children are supported to close the gap in academic attainment.  Polish schools face similar challenges and our British Council Ambassador has recommended courses available in Gdansk that will provide us with training to improve the chances of our disadvantaged children.  Not only is this a target from Ofsted, but also a Trust vision.\r\n\r\nIt is recognised by the Government that there is an issue with teacher recruitment.  There is an increasing shortage of primary teachers, particularly in the East of England.  A recent survey had 125 responders with shortages of at least 40 teachers; this survey excludes the number of supply teachers who fill vacancies temporarily.  These responders are only a third of Essex schools so the number of vacancies is much higher than suggested.  The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) has recognised that Essex is of particular concern.  We would send our trainee and newly qualified teachers to Lagos as part of a recruitment and retention package and to develop their skills.  We have a rigorous continuous professional development programme which begins after three years.  We would therefore make the training in Lagos part of our overall package and would offer it to teachers before they reached the crucial three year period which has been highlighted as a point at which teachers often leave the profession.  We will also send our Teaching School Director (TSD) who is responsible for ITT management.  She sits on the East of England ITT Management Board which feeds directly into NCTL restructuring of ITT.  The TSD would use her training in Portugal to assess successful routes into teacher training.\r\n\r\nThe schools in the Trust are expanding their Nurture Group, to take into account the increasing number of pupils with diverse social and emotional needs.  Our Inclusion Policy has clear aims and sets out the following principles: setting suitable learning challenges, responding to pupils' diverse needs and overcoming potential barriers to learning.  We would send  4 Nurture staff and 2 counsellors to Berlin to attend training and to research exciting and varied approaches to nurture.  Germany has taken a large number of refugees and is therefore in a unique position to offer advice as to how to support these vulnerable people.  Many of our nurture children are from refugee backgrounds.  Our nurture staff are long standing members of the HEARTS team and would benefit from fresh approaches.  One of our schools has 67% vulnerable pupils, and another school has 59%.  These children face daily disadvantage by struggling with social, emotional, learning and physical needs.\r\n\r\nWith the local authority team being reduced, and the emergence of Teaching School Alliances (TSA) taking responsibility for school-to-school support it is essential that we develop our Early Years (EY) settings to become the Early Years Teaching School Alliance Centre of Excellence in Essex.  In order to do this we will send 6 EY staff and Managers to Denmark to learn about their strategies for EY.  Scandinavian schools trailblaze in the area of EY with a particular focus on independence and Outdoor Learning.  As a Trust we support Forest Schools and need to develop the outdoor learning objectives further. Training in EY settings in Denmark would help us to be innovative and share our learning through developing a training programme for EY Teachers in Essex.  We have the opportunity, as part of a TSA, to shape EY Education in Essex.  \r\n\r\nAs a result of these training programmes we expect our staff and our teaching to radically improve, as will our commitment to ongoing learning.  We will provide opportunities for creativity and engaging methods of teaching for our youngest and most disadvantaged pupils.  It is important to us to improve our international links and our connections to the wider world.", "http://www.heartsacademytrust.co.uk", "HEARTS Academy Trust", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035547_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SS11"}
