Policy and Roadmap and Sp.L.D. Teacher & Adult Learner Training", "Lancashire Centre for Specific Learning Difficulties", 198581.0, "The Project follows on from a Grundtvig Project completed in 2013 (Specific Learning Disabilities [Sp.L.D.] Roadmap for teacher and adult learner training) which established that Sp.L.D. consists of  7 learning disabilities, co-existing to varying degrees which, due to the same underlying information processing deficiencies, will require similar pedagogical approaches. In the majority of EU nations, co-existence of such disabilities is neither accepted nor diagnosed.  Therefore, there is little or no training for adults, teachers nor support for children/students. Unidentified, Sp.L.D. results in low self esteem, high stress, atypical behaviour,  mental health problems, low achievement and early school leaving. This can also lead to violence in school and later anti-social behaviour within communities. In the worst case it can lead to criminal acts and imprisonment. The reverse is also true where children and young persons, having had on-going support for their Sp.L.D., go on to higher education and become valuable citizens. Using Eurostat population data, in 2010 there were between 17 to 46 Million persons, between the ages of 3 to 25, in the EU-27 with Sp.L.D.  For such numbers to remain unidentified and, as a consequence unsupported, is a massive lost generation that the EU cannot afford to lose in today\u2019s global market. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time, and as one of the first Erasmus Plus Projects, Europe can take the next critical and essential steps to produce an EU Sp.L.D. Policy and Roadmap and create an effective and consistent European Sp.L.D. Adult Learner & Teacher e-Training Programme which would finally address the major problems with unidentified and, as a consequence, unsupported Sp.L.D.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 9 EU Partners from the Estonia (Tallin University); Germany (Institut fuer systemisch-integrative Lerntherapie, Leipzig); Greece (Hellenic Dyslexia Association); Italy (Istituto d'Istruzione Superiore \"F.S. Nitti\"); Poland (Stowarzyszenie Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 i Wychowank\u00f3w Zespo\u0142u Szk\u00f3\u0142); Romania (Tibiscus University from Timisoara, Faculty of Psychology); Slovenia (University of Ljubljana) ; Turkey (Egitim Uretim ve Sanat Dernegi) and United Kingdom (Lancashire Centre for Specific Learning Difficulties)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the area of Sp.L.D., the 3 year project will:\r\n\r\n- Determine National Policies, understanding and defnitions and their co-existence at Academic Institute and Schools levels\r\n\r\n- Develop dissemination Information documents/e-documents\r\n\r\n- Determine potential 'socio/political' barriers to their acceptance and co-existence, including National inclusive education and legal frameworks\r\n\r\n- Determine National pedagogical and teacher/adult learner training approaches including both academic/theoretical and practical training\r\n\r\n- Produce an EU Sp.L.D. Policy, Definitions and Teacher/Adult Learner Training Policy Document\r\n\r\n- Disseminate a recommended EU Sp.L.D. Policy and Roadmap to the ET2020 Committee\r\n\r\n- Develop & Evaluate Sp.L.D. Teacher & Adult Learner Training Courses\r\n\r\n- Develop Sp.L.D. e-training platform\r\n\r\n- Implement Sp.L.D. e-training Courses\r\n\r\n- Two Conferences: 1. Dissemninate EU Sp.L.D. Policy, Definitions and Teacher/Adult Learner Training Policy Document; 2. Disseminate EU Sp.L.D. Policy and Sp.L.D. Interactive e-Training Courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn particular, whereas Specific Learning Disabilities (Sp.L.D.) have been, in the main, undiagnosed and therefore unsupported throughout Europe, the Project will facilitate a quantuum leap in knowledge of how Sp.L.D. has detrimentally affected the past, current and future generations of students and adults throughout Europe. Moreover, the detailed and different levels of Sp.L.D. Teacher Training created will enable all participants, participating organisations, target groups and relevent stakeholders to both identify Sp.L.D. and support students and adults with Sp.L.D. in both schools, tertiary education and related NGOs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clearly recognised that although the EU cannot force its member nations to implement its recommended Sp.L.D. policy changes, the socio-political impact awareness that this project will generate at regional, national and European levels will be such that they will not be able to retain the status-quo of permitting unidentified and unsupported Sp.L.D. Moroever, even if only a minority of member nations accept and implement the project recommendations, countless numbers of EU citizens will have their lives changed for the positive - transformed from their perspective of feeling rejected and useless to having their true potential as valuable citizens realised. This reaches into to the very heart of vision of ET2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very important to note that the valorisation impact such a development of e-training could have using Open edX - it is highly likely that this will be one of the first  developments in the EU and, as such, its impact across the whole of the EU for e-Training cannot be overestimated.", "http://www.redroseschool.co.uk", "Lancashire Centre for Specific Learning Difficulties", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA200-001652_coordinator"], ["4DG", "THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE!", "LSA Technology and Performing Arts College", 162380.0, "In the last years, our schools and educational systems are confronting several problems:\r\n- students need more skills and experience in order to succeed in todays\u2019 employment market;\r\n- the processes mentioned above involve an identity crisis; many people feel like they lost their national identity and they are unable to understand the European identity as a sum of all the national and local identities. \r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nO1: to contribute to the development of a sense of identity at the three levels local-national-European, a key component of an active European citizenship;\r\nO2: to raise the awareness of such a central European value as the diversity \u2013> understanding and appreciating the values and cultural heritage from all the continent; \r\nO3: to use non-formal educational means in fulfilling the objectives of the formal education;\r\nO4: to create an environment for exercising the key-competences, especially language competences (foreign and mother languages), digital skills and learning to learn and to foster the transversal aspect of these skills;\r\nO5: to involve students with few opportunities and with risk of early school leaving in various educational activities in order to improve their responsibility, their self-confidence and their sense of belonging to the school and to the community. These students have to be at least 20% of all the students (both directly and indirectly) involved.\r\nO6: to develop more attractive didactic tools in line with the needs and expectations of the new generations, promoting the interdisciplinary activities;\r\nO7: to revise and to improve the professional profile of the teachers involved;\r\nO8: to promote the transnational dissemination of good practice and innovation in education. \r\n\r\nNeeds addressed:\r\n- the decreasing level of sustaining the active citizenship values and the European values in various European countries, in the last years;\r\n- the need to develop a better understanding and assimilation of the diversity of the European identity by the young generations;\r\n- a rising reserve in assuming the local/national values and identities in the same time with (not against!) building a sense of openness to the cultural differences; \r\n- the increasing necessity of the improvement of the language competences for the entire target groups;\r\n- the necessity of confronting the increasing levels of educational failure and early school leaving with innovative tools and concrete opportunities for remaining in the school;\r\n- the improvement of the educational environment -> increasing the satisfaction and motivation in every day activity (for both the students and teachers);\r\n- the openness for the integration of new and innovative methods and practice in teaching;\r\n- the lack of an auxiliary and a course curriculum similar to those of this project;\r\n-the need of improvement in the contribution of non-formal educational activities to the formal education results;\r\n\r\nThe main results:\r\nR 1. eBook, \u201cTHE HISTORY OF THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE\u201d:\r\nR 2.

CURRICULAR AUXILIARY for teaching History, Civics, Counselling and Orientation:\r\n\r\n The activities of the project are both learning activities for students and training activities for teachers, including short-term join activities abroad. The students will use their competences and knowledge from History, Civics, Literature, Arts, Geography, Economy, ICT etc. in a cross curricular manner. They will search for the past of their places and they will discover how the places changed during (at least one century) and how these changes shaped the life of the people and how the people shaped the face of the place. They will learn how to valorise their heritage and how the common European heritage is, in fact, built by the values of each place. They will become more confident in their capacities and they will become more connected with and more proud of their city and their school.\r\nAlso, the students will learn to \u201csell\u201d their place in a tourist manner. They will learn how to pay attention to the foreign colleagues and to see what they are looking for and what things could make them come again. They will develop tourist products and they will exhibit them and even sell them in a tourist fair.\r\nThe projects also intend to help teachers to share their experiences and to learn from one another. The final products are intended to become didactic tolls for every day activity, and the methods develop to be used again and again in our activity and to repeat the experience of the project with many other students.", "http://www.lythamhigh.lancs.scu.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA219-015226_1"], ["4DG", "youth@home-in.europe", "LSA Technology and Performing Arts College", 136743.0, "Students and teachers from eight  high schools from Greece, Norway, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, France , Slovenia and Germany will cooperate over a span of 2,5 years in order to  focus on modern technology combined with one of the main concerns European societies face today- are we still at home in our countries ?  Europe is changing, economically, politically and  culturally. Some countries intend to leave, others hope to someday be part of this vast community.  Many of our countries are coping with  the  flow of political and econnomical refugees, others are suffering their own economical crisises. We all must deal with a new, constant fear of terror.  \r\n\r\nWe believe that we must learn to cooperate more closely and see Europe as our common, and yet diverse homeland, deliberate about our problems and finding solutions, so that we will all, together as one,  develop and establish a peaceful interface where people, goods, and ideas move freely and safely. This  understanding is also anchored in our project title- \"youth@home-in.europe\"- thus emphasising our mutual interests, values and similarities  and our appreciation for them. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, by investigating what being at home in Europe means for teenagers today and in the future we will have a closer look at our partners\u00b4 locations to create future interconnecting paths of communication and mutual understanding among European cities, experiencing  each place\u00b4s  uniqueness  as well as its diversity.  Like we are. \r\n\r\nWe believe in active learning and have therefore scheduled eight transnational \u201cLearning/Teaching/Training activities\u201d meetings, one in each partner school. In each of these meetings, a delegation of two teachers and two  students from each partner school will visit the host school. Prior to each meeting, the students of all schools will be collaborating on  topics relating to it\u00b4s own cultural identity. Also in reference to how that identity is changing due to multicultural influences. \r\n\r\nForming transnational teams, our students will communicate using videoconferencing, emailing and social media, and work on topics and products leading to our mutual film, as our main product outcome. They will learn basic communication in the native language through a multilinguistic toolbox, and become acquainted with the educational system of the host country. \r\n\r\nThe expected results of this collaboration will be depicted in output material (like reports,  posters, narratives, photographies, the project\u2019s web page, etc), which in turn will be used to reach out to as many European citizens as possible. After each meeting, each school will organize special multiplier events, in order to disseminate these results to the other teachers and pupils of their schools, and the local community. Careful evaluation of each meeting will offer constructive feedback, improving thus the project as it comes to its completion. \r\n\r\nAs for the long-term benefits of this project, the participating schools believe that  students and future European citizens and potential decision-makers will be able to learn to cooperate beyond ethnic, national, linguistic, cultural restrictions and stereotypes. Exploring the interface of Europeans can thus mould responsible and active citizens, who will interact and uphold European unity and be able to answer the question if we are still@ home in Europe.", "http://www.lythamhigh.lancs.scu.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035540_1"], ["4DG", "Reporting on our past, investigating our future", "LSA Technology and Performing Arts College", 117314.0, "At a time when more and more people do not believe in Europe anymore, we want this project to\r\nshow how Europe is important to us and help our pupils to project themselves as European\r\ncitizens.\r\nTo do so, we want them to report on their past and investigate their future. We want them to make\r\nlinks between European past and European future from a historical, cultural, architectural and\r\npolitical point of view.\r\nFor example, they will have to report on our historical heritage, on our \u00ab movers and shakers \u00bb, on\r\nthe main historical landmarks which helped building an European identity; but also cultural whether\r\nit is art or architecture.\r\nWe would like them to make plans for the future. Where will they be in 10 years. What does the future look like for Europe?\r\nAs far as archtecture is concerned, the objective is to work on industrial buildings and their rehabilitation. We will then move into the future and ask ourselves how can historic buildings be used in the future.\r\nAbout 150 pupils will be directly involved in the project but we also intend to the whole schools for\r\nthe major events in some way or another.\r\nOur main objectives are to engage students in becoming better global citizens,help them  have a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of their own culture, of others\u2019 cultures, to improve their skills wether it is in\r\nlanguages, ICT, public speech, communication.
