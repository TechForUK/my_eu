The most economical way of limiting VOC emission is using water-based coating formulas in which water replaces a substantial amount of the organic solvents traditionally used. Unfortunately, water-based formulas have deficient properties in comparison to solvent-based, primarily as a consequence of using water as a solvent: poor wood wetting, high grain raising, longer drying times, foam formation, insufficient glossy aspect, and deficient overall resistance. Coatings (varnishes and paints) are of key importance to the final products of our industries: coatings define the visual aspect and softness of the furniture piece, influencing its effective purchase; also the durability and resistance of a coating is a measure of the quality of the whole piece. The aim of NEXT1KOAT is to give European woodworking and furniture manufacturers a long-lasting solution by developing a first triple system (exterior uses impregnation; interior uses undercoat and topcoat) of one-component (1K) \u201chigh solids\u201d (>70%) water-based coatings. NEXT1KOAT will be produced by European SME coating manufacturers due to its affordable chemistry based on seaweed polymers, and it has been designed for European woodworking and furniture small and medium coating installations. NEXT1KOAT will have the following advanced properties: Less water content (30%), reduced drying time and less grain raising, improved wood wetting without the use of surfactants, less foam formation, more glossy final aspect and increased hardness.", 170822.0, 1964064.0, "NEXT1KOAT", null, null, null, "http://www.next1koat.eu/", "http://www.marinebioploymers.com", null, "fp7_106527_968348285"], ["8JH", "From sea-bed to test-bed:\nharvesting the potential of marine microbes for industrial biotechnology", "Marine Biopolymers Limited", "SeaBioTech is a 48-month project designed and driven by SMEs to create innovative marine biodiscovery pipelines as a means to convert the potential of marine biotechnology into novel industrial products for the pharmaceutical (human and aquaculture), cosmetic, functional food and industrial chemistry sectors. SeaBioTech will reduce barriers to successful industrial exploitation of marine biodiversity for companies more accustomed to \u2018terrestrial\u2019 biotechnology. SeaBioTech directly addresses five key challenges to remove bottlenecks in the marine biodiscovery pipeline, leading to (1) improvements in the quality of marine resources available for biotechnological exploitation, (2) improvement in technical aspects of the biodiscovery pipeline to shorten time to market, and (3) developing sustainable modes of supply of raw materials for industry. The two last challenges centre on enabling activities to enhance the marine biodiscovery process: first, clarification of legal aspects to facilitate access to marine resources, their sustainable use, and their secure exploitation; second, to create an improved framework for access to marine biotechnology data and research materials. To achieve its goals, SeaBioTech brings together complementary and world-leading experts, integrating biology, genomics, natural product chemistry, bioactivity testing, industrial bioprocessing, legal aspects, market analysis and knowledge exchange. The expertise assembled within the consortium reflects the industry-defined needs, from the SME partners\u2019 initial definition of market and product opportunities to their ultimate proof-of-concept demonstration activities.

A standardised sampling process was used to collect microbes from hydrothermal vents off the coast of Iceland and deep-sea basins in the eastern Mediterranean. Other microorganisms were collected from previously unsampled areas of the Scottish coast.\n\nProject partners, which include small and medium-sized enterprises, are identifying and overcoming the main hurdles facing successful exploitation of marine microbes for industrial biotechnology. This involves improving the quality of marine resources available for biological exploitation and an improvement in technical aspects to shorten time to market. SEABIOTECH will also develop ways to sustainably manufacture products on an industrial scale.\n\nResearchers created a centralised databank to store genomic, chemistry and bioactivity information on the collected microbes and from existing collections. They also sequenced 13 genomes from bacteria collected from around hydrothermal vents. Genomes were also sequenced for bacteria isolated from seawater and from a marine sponge species (Petrosia ficiformis).\n\nThe study showed that studying the metabolites present in the bacteria that live in sponges can aid in their selection and speed up the discovery of new drugs. The microorganism Vibrio splendidus was found to act strongly against Mycobacterium marinum, a free-living bacteria that causes opportunistic infections in humans.\n\nSEABIOTECH will play a significant role in helping to ensure Europe's position as a world leader in biotechnology.

The feasibility study includes examining the technical- and economic viability, identification of specific technical risks, raw material risks and alternative sources in order to proof the viability of the technology and highlight the economic benefits. The proposal is outlining the need for elaboration of vital commercial elements in a Business Plan, including development of an Organizational and Financial strategy.\n\nAlginor will establish a biorefinery for seaweeds based on our highly innovative AORTA technology. The concept aims at total utilization of seaweed by a multiproduct blue biorefinery. The concept achieves cost-advantages through cost-sharing over multiple products such as biopolymers, savoury, bioactive compounds as well as food and feed products. The product portfolio will facilitate new value chains and meet customer demands, especially according to mega-trends within Pharma & API, Health & Nutrition, Food, Biomaterials, Feed, Agro and Chemical industries. Initial focus in the key markets is the need for high-grade powders to the food-, health- and nutrition industries. Higher product yield from an ultra-pure and formula-specific product portfolio improves overall economy of the project. Further, the AORTA concept will increase raw material utilization to ~100% and make utilization of environmental chemicals in the production obsolete.  \n\nThe planned feasibility study is a step towards minimizing risks during commercialization of the technology. The ultimate business goal is to establish a large scale manufacturing unit (the biorefinery). Risk minimization through first performing a demonstration-plant of smaller scale in order to control project-risk is vital for future financing.
