Among them, 5 will be selected from those students classed as having special educational needs. \r\n\r\nThis Erasmus+ project will focus on providing European Mobility experiences for our 30 young apprentices in the 16-20 age group who will travel to Austria in July 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian National Sport Centre Obertraun, hosting partner, is a regional training and coaching complex used by top European professional clubs and National Teams (Chelsea FC, Everton FC, Red Bull Salzburg). Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Furthermore, they will participate in learning sessions on communicative language classes, dual career opportunities, EU values and on the EURES mobility network.\r\n \r\nIn view of the differing restrictions imposed by the varying scholastic commitments of the players as they progress through their BTEC 3 \u2013 Diploma in Sport, plus their commitment to competitive match fixtures it was agreed by all of the partners that a two weeks mobility period would provide maximum benefit from a European mobility experience, while imposing minimum disruption to academic and vocational training courses. \r\n\r\nMobility will be preceded by a structured preparatory phase involving their Further Education Colleges and families, facilitating optimal absorption of the vocational training and skills development at the host institution during the two weeks mobility period abroad.\r\n\r\nOur Austrian host partner is applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development. Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and players development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the first team ranks are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European work experience will improve employability in secondary careers for those not fortunate enough to make the professional grade. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives:\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes;\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and staff and the local staff in Europe;\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers and in dual careers pathways;\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and a full awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country;\r\n5. Enhanced intercultural awareness;\r\n6. Increased maturity, self-empowerment, self-esteem and sense of initiative;\r\n7. More active participation in work and social environments (Active citizenship);\r\n8. Enhancement of soft skills;\r\n9. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur Austrian partner is fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted participants in recent years from a variety of European countries under the previous Lifelong Learning Programme \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci funding scheme.\r\n\r\nA typical day will be divided into two training sessions with Academy participants working under the direction of their and Obertraun\u2019s coaches to fully experience the European club environment. Within each training programme there will be periods each day reserved for individual training elements aimed at addressing the participants\u2019 personal development. For example, each participant will be given occasion to discuss aspects of coaching specific to that football discipline with hosting personnel, understanding the differences between the two approaches and encouraged to ratiocinate about them.\r\n\r\nBetween the two training sessions there will be a daily 1.5 hours of language classes, also based on the communicative approach. It is worldwide recognised that language assimilation is far more efficient while implemented onsite. Also, throughout the whole 14 days mobility project several modules will be developed, each of 1.5 hours, on dual careers opportunities, EU values and EURES network opportunities.\r\n\r\nYoung people in the UK are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people who have poor records of academic achievement or are socially disadvantaged. At present, less than 1% of persons under the age of 21 and not enrolled in an Academic course in the UK will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this national shortcoming and will contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy.\r\n\r\nBarnsley FC\u2019s dissemination activities will be complemented by Obertraun.", "http://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/", "BARNSLEY FOOTBALL COMPANY 2002 LIMITED", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012855_coordinator"], ["1ET", "Reds in the Maltese Communities", "Reds in the Community", 59821.0, "Reds in the Community (RITC) the charitable arm of Barnsley Football Club, who deliver sports activities to UK-based groups particularly to those considered disadvantaged by socio-economical circumstance are to engage in a European mobility.  It has sought a Maltese sports provider, Luxol Sport Foundation, who share similar organisational goals, to participate in a social inclusion programme for its target audiences. Twenty-six BTEC Sports Diploma students, mostly residing within the boundaries of a district within the lower quartile of deprivation, will participate in a two-week project that aims to engage Malta's refugee communities in meaningful and purposeful sporting activities. The  mobility project titled \"Reds in the Maltese Communities\" will see students use their educational training and practical experiences to plan and deliver sports activities at Luxol Sport Foundation's high profile facilities. The students currently studying at Barnsley FC will be accompanied and supported whilst in Malat by Luxol Sports Foundation sports professionals, as they work through their placement period. \r\nThe students will follow and complete their training module whilst in Malta and this will be validated by sports professionals in addition to being presented with official Europass Mobility Documents to acknowledge their achievements. The mobility visit will also allow students to bring and present a number of RITC social inclusion activities that seeks to engage other disadvantaged groups in healthy sporting activities. Students will also gain a cultural experience and increase their Global outlook, visits to the key Maltese landmarks and building of significance will included in the mobility period and will inform students of Malta's extraordinary historical past and its long association with UK. Exposure to new settings, environments and language and planning and delivering activities to new audiences will present challenges, although students will have overcome a number of barriers in entering the project and will increase their life-skills throughout this mobility experience.\r\nThe short-term gains will see students returning from the training placement with much more improved confidence and self-achievement, increased accreditation and qualification and a student more aware on global issues. RITC will be able to develop their curriculum design so as to widen student experience in mobility activities, increase CPD that extends to Internationalisation and develop partnership working with companies abroad to increase mobility employment opportunities.", "http://www.barnsleyfccommunity.co.uk", "Reds in the Community", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047306_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S71"}
