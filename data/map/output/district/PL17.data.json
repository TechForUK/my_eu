Self evaluation processes have shown that science department staff would benefit from training to enhance levels of student engagement, creativity in lesson planning and to develop sequences of lessons which promote higher levels of challenge for students of all abilities. We have worked with Sintermeerten College since 2010 in a variety of contexts including Comenius school partnerships and a Leonardo TOI project. Their science department teach some classes in English, so we plan to focus on this area to enable Callington Community College science teachers to observe, co-plan and, possibly, co-teach at Sintermeerten College to develop their skills and reflect on their own practice and co-reflect on their own and the other participant's practice in a different context. The nature of the context will promote greater reflection.\r\nParticipants will be selected following application and interview with priority given to colleagues who demonstrate motivation and have the capacity to develop their practice and that of the department along with the ability to reflect on their own development. The underlying aim of the project is to move the science department from good to outstanding. Three five day visits for pairs of teachers are planned preceded by pre-visit briefing and preparation including Skype conversation with Sintermeerten College colleagues. During each visit, the two teachers will undertake focussed lesson observations relevant to their specialism and personal targets, co-planning, possible co-teaching and co-reflection. \r\nAfter the visit, participants will be required to demonstrate impact on their own teaching and wider impact on the department. They will also be supported to disseminate their findings and progress towards agreed targets. Initial impact envisaged is an improvement in student attitudes and engagement in science lessons, along with evidence of increased challenge for students of all abilities measured through lesson observations and work with student focus groups as part of college self-evaluation/performance management systems. Longer term, an improvement in science GCSE results is envisaged. There is a real commitment to raising student outcomes as measured by GCSE results (%A* to C) to be in line with and exceed national performance measures.", "http://www.callingtoncc.net", "Callington Community College", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002026_coordinator"], ["7DR", "Students Promoting Active Citizenship in Europe", "Callington Community College", 108179.0, "The SPACE Award has been developed as a response to the concern that young people  are becoming increasingly disenfranchised in Europe today and that the turnout at elections is especially low in 18 - 24 year olds across Europe.  In many European countries including Britain, there is a sense that young people are disengaging with the political process. Young adults are less likely to vote, there is a lowering of the registration to vote in some countries and movements are growing to encourage young people to abstain rather than engage.  If left to continue, this lack of engagement has the potential to destabilise countries.  In the current political climate, therefore, there is  a clear imperative to  tackle this problem to ensure young people see the importance of participation in the political process and are able to use their voice positively and become active citizens.\r\nThe six project partners will all be working with a range of other partners locally, regionally and in later stages of the project, also nationally and transnationally, meaning that there will be a very large number of indirect participants due to the multiplier effect planned into the project.\r\nThe SPACE Award is a student citizenship package that aims to develop young people's understanding of democratic processes. It offers an accessible framework for student councils and committees from which young people can learn how to create and build an effective student council.   This project aims:\r\n\u2022 To promote young people\u2019s active participation and understanding of the democratic process \r\n\u2022 To develop effective student councils.\r\n\u2022 To embed young people's understanding of council roles and responsibilities \r\n\u2022 To enable young people to articulate their own point of view and understand others\u2019 points of view\r\n\u2022 To promote understanding and respect \r\n\u2022 To develop student leadership\r\n\u2022 To give young people an understanding of their place in the world as a member of their own country and as a European citizen\r\n\u2022 To develop transferable skills to prepare young people for the work place \r\nThe project will develop a set of criteria to allow students to develop  a range of skills over time. The criteria builds from Bronze, to Silver  to Gold so that students can refine and develop their skills. The criteria builds from basic skills in terms of running and leading a student council to more far reaching skills that include the local community and beyond.   Once Gold is achieved students can then train to be assessors of other schools and colleges working towards their Award. This allows for a roll out of the Award to partner schools and encourages links between schools as well as links with International Partner schools. The Award will develop student leadership skills. As more schools achieve the Gold Award, Award ceremony events will take place to further promote the Award.  Assessments would be undertaken again after three years to ensure that students continued to monitor and evaluate their practice and to allow for a change in student membership as well as ensuring sustainability. There is also potential for a Platinum Award at a later stage of development.\r\nThe SPACE Award is a complete package with interactive tools that can be utilised by schools and colleges and tailored to individual organisations; for example, all materials will be written in the home language.  Materials will be reproduceable and can be shared with other colleagues.\r\n  Schools will develop effective student councils\r\n\u2022 Students will be empowered to lead their own councils \r\n\u2022 Students will be supported to deliver training to partner schools/colleges/institutions on the programme\r\n\u2022 Students will be trained as assessors for other schools/colleges/institutions\r\n\u2022 A set of measurable common criteria will be used to measure and recognise the work of effective student councils. \r\n\u2022 Students will have a greater understanding of the democratic process and how to actively engage to effect change\r\n\u2022 Students will develop their leadership skills and acquire \r\nThe Award is closely linked to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and meets the requirement to inform all children of these rights.", "http://www.callingtoncc.net", "Callington Community College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013852_coordinator"], ["8BQ", "A Healthy Mind for a Modern World", "Harrowbarrow School", 33842.0, "In the current education climate, it is well recognized that certain issues are prevalent across European schools namely: the difficulties of ensuring social cohesion between different groups of pupils from different ethnic or social backgrounds; the growing gap between vulnerable pupils such as those from economically deprived backgrounds or from those from vulnerable ethnic groups and their peers and the growing concerns about the emotional health and wellbeing of pupils throughout the education system.   A Healthy Mind For A Modern World brings together current thinking about teaching pedagogies from different European schools as a way to tackle these issues in a holistic way.  The project aims to combine best practice from Swedish schools in relation to how Forest school can be used to improve emotional wellbeing as well as best practice from Cornish schools in how critical thinking can support pupils in developing their own sense of self.   This will be compared to how schools in Slovenia use music and dance to integrate pupils from disparate social and ethnic backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nThe aims are to share these best practices across the partner schools from Sweden, Slovenia, and UK.  3 members of staff from each partner school will observe best practice in their partner school.  From these visits, educational activities will be organised in the partner schools that will use elements from Forest school, critical thinking as well as the arts to deal with issues of social cohesion and academic attainment.   From this initial meetings, the benefits will be felt by the pupils across all the partner schools - namely some 2,000 students in total.  \r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits will be that these pedagogies will become more widely known not only in the partner schools but in the schools in the local area.  It is hoped that the materials produced by the project - a booklet of teaching ideas and a video to be uploaded on Youtube - will also help to inspire all teachers and teaching staff on how they can improve the outcomes for their pupils through the use of Forest schools and critical thinking.", "http://www.harrowbarrow.cornwall.sch.uk", "Lewannick Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036697_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8PH", "Blackburn's Rivers Important to Lancashire Landscape Investment And Natural Capital Economy (BRILLIaNCE)", "The Rivers Trust", "Improving the biodiversity of two rivers in Lancashire through the creation of a natural river bed and introdution of fish passes to allow fish to access the river upstream", "ERDF", 626515.0, 1044192.0, "erdf_england_420"], ["8PH", "Water for Growth", "Westcountry Rivers Trust", "Aligns 2010 Lawton report Making Space for Nature, 2011 Nat Env paper \u2018Natural Choice\u2019,one of four drivers identified by Ecosystems Task Force (2013).Aligns England Biodiversity Strategy 2020& Defra appraisal scored the vfm as satisfactory.", "ERDF", 1588288.0, 2188235.0, "erdf_england_519"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL17"}
