These lower percentages can indeed be said to stem from a certain form of social determinism, but a deeper comparison of academies with the same social framework show that this is not the only reason. Besides, such low academic success comes with sharp contrasts in the mastery of language between pupils belonging to higher and lower social classes. This situation questions the school system\u2019s ability to make underachievers progress, and to improve the overall quality of its teaching as well as its overall success.\r\n\r\nThe Framework Act on the Republic\u2019s Educational Framework Planning and Renewal passed on July 8 2013 aims at actively combating early school leaving and academic failure. The teachers play a fundamental role in these reforms, whose main lines they will have to get to grips with. Lille\u2019s academic consortium for European mobility in a school environment (in French: CALME_sco III) aims at providing better training to teachers, developing formative observation practices and feedback between teachers, and reinforcing educational support in schools. Such professionalization of the position of teacher is bound to contribute to fighting against early school leaving and to helping underachievers and underachieving schools.\r\n\r\nCALME_sco III therefore programs formative European mobility for 100 members of staff in the academy of Lille: 83% of them are in junior schools, 49% in priority education (primary or secondary school), 9% in vocational training. The staff is distributed between 7 junior schools in 5 different pools, 5 primary schools associated with 2 of the aforementioned junior schools, 1 vocational high school and the LEA\u2019s inspecting body for vocational training. Their mobility will essentially be a period of immersive observation, sometimes preceded by a time for taking part in a structured lesson \u2013 including a linguistic training period covering defined targets \u2013 and in three junior schools it will lead to longer stays including periods of teaching.\r\n\r\nCALME_sco III mainly relies on the training of the educational support staff as well as work in networks. 5 members of the management staff be a driving force for CALME_sco III: their own training mobility (done with CALME_sco III or with another academic programme) will instigate the formative and collaborative mobility of the teaching staff in their junior or vocational high schools, if not in the priority education network of their schools, towards partner schools in Europe. 5 out of the 7 junior schools that are partners in CALME_sco III are in a priority education network and bring 5 of the schools and one LEA inspecting body in their network in their wake. CALME_sco regroups the projects of these 5 schools, these 7 junior schools, this vocation high school and 3 trainee IEN-EG/ET inspectors by providing them with what they need in terms of common academic direction and management, and by giving them the opportunity to communicate throughout the length of the CALME_sco III programme.\r\n\r\nCALME_sco III counts on European, formative mobility for all types of staff and for every level of the education system, helping 100 members of staff in continuing or statutory education (3 members of the management staff and 3 inspectors) to combat academic failure and to help underachieving pupils as well as underachieving schools. This mobility must contribute to stopping the vicious circle of underachievement and inequalities in order to enter a virtuous circle of European openness, of social diversity and academic success.

The desire to create this new partnership runs alongside the city's ambition to become European Capital of Culture in 2023.  Leeds schools are working closely with the council to ensure that children and young people will be at the heart of the Leeds2023 bid.\r\n\r\nWe have created a forum for head teachers who are committed to improving the arts and cultural education provision in Leeds schools, who are involved in the creation of the LCEP and who are supporting the Leeds2023 bid.  Recent discussions at a meeting of this head teachers' forum raised the need for Leeds to look outwards to its European partners and to learn from their best practice. The head teachers were keen to advocate for the value of arts education in delivering a broad and balanced curriculum for all children in Leeds, but they felt the need to learn how other European cities embrace the value of cultural education and how arts and culture subjects are taught in their schools.

In this way we are building new \"Partnerships in Arts and Cultural Education\", or PACE.\r\n\r\nThe PACE project has been designed in response to this demand, in order to allow a consortium of schools to undertake job shadowing with schools in other European cities which are successful in delivering arts and cultural learning through:\r\n- the formal curriculum\r\n- extra-curricular activity\r\n- effective partnerships between school and art and cultural providers to deliver the above\r\n\r\nThe job-shadowing visits will involve the headteacher or deputy head from all 8 participating schools, plus a middle leader from each school, totalling 16 teaching staff.  In addition the job-shadowing will involve 4 local authority staff who work directly with consortium schools to develop their work around cultural education and who are working towards the creation of the Leeds Cultural Education Partnership.\r\n\r\nLeeds City Council has identified and selected a number of partner cities to work with, each of which has an excellent reputation in the field of cultural education.  Each of them has a slightly different focus or specialism and the learning and development needs of each consortium member is considered when allocating mobility participants to the different job shadowing mobilities.  The cities are Dortmund in Germany, Lille in France, Espoo in Finland and Malmo in Sweden, each offering consortium members an insight into:\r\n\r\n- the education system of the host country\r\n- the way in which cultural education is delivered in the city and the legacy of European Capital of Culture (for Lille and Dortmund)\r\n- the way in which schools deliver cultural education within the curriculum \r\n- the way in which cultural education is delivered through extra-curricular activity and the role of schools and local education authorities in promoting this\r\n- an insight into how schools and the local education authorities work in partnership with arts and cultural organisations\r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will bring back new innovative teaching methods, improved foreign language skills, new ideas for partnership working with cultural organisations, higher levels of motivation, a renewed passion for the European dimension, ideas of how to use arts and culture when working with migrant children and students with EAL, an ability to challenge stereotypes and promote tolerance and inter-cultural understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe learning from the visits will be disseminated widely.

The prevalence of autism is approximately 1% of the population. People with autism are entering HE at an increasing and unprecedented rate. These individuals are academically competent and might achieve better than their peers without autism. Unfortunately, at the end of their studies, this group faces a substantial employment gap: A large group of skillful individuals is left without employment. \r\n\r\nThe reasons are multifold: Careers advice provided by HE institutions is ineffective for autistic students; academic tutors lack understanding of how best to support autistic students develop employability skills or gain work experience; recruitment procedures create barriers; and employers are unsure how to support autistic graduates in the job.. This is despite the many qualities that make them desirable employees: attention to detail, honesty, loyalty, working longer hours and punctuality.\r\n\r\nEuropean HE systems currently fail this student group, and autistic graduates enter a fast-growing pool of untapped economic potential, preventing personal fulfilment and creating long-term costs to society.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the IMAGE project are:\r\n\r\n1) To create an employability toolkit for autistic students so that they can develop their employability skills and better understand career goals;\r\n2) To develop new training materials for HE careers advisors so that they better support autistic students, and provide training to 400 advisors across the partner countries;\r\n3) To share examples of good support practice with academics, HE senior managers and policy makers and thereby make HE sector more inclusive;\r\n4) To make employers better recognise the strengths and benefits of qualified autistic employees, and reduce disabling barriers to recruitment and employment.\r\n\r\nThe project will use a participatory design methodology, involving the target groups in the conception and design of all outputs.

In the past 15 years, doping behaviour research and anti-doping education have come a long way but these efforts remain largely isolated and uncoordinated.  It is imperative that we now activate a collaborative doping prevention agenda and shift the focus away from stopping the bad (doping) to promoting and helping the good (clean athlete). Instead of trying to understand what drives some athletes to dope, anti-doping research should concentrate on what drives clean athletes to remain so.  At a time when the media is perpetuating the belief that doping is widespread, the voices of clean athletes need to be heard and this has become a priority for National Anti-Doping Organisations across the EU, who serve to protect the right of athletes to clean sport in their own countries, and abroad.

The development of a suitably educated coaching workforce has been recognised as a priority area at the highest levels of European policy. The European Commission has also expressed the need to bring coaching qualifications into national frameworks and thus align them with wider tools such as EQF, ECTS, ECVET and EQAVET. Where coaching qualifications already sit within national frameworks, they tend to do so within the vocational education and training (VET) sector. Enhancing the quality and status of VET is a European Commission priority. Member States have made a commitment to investing in VET to raise the effectiveness and attractiveness of VET qualifications. These policies seek to increase the employability of people, reduce skills' mismatches, facilitate the transition into employment and promote personal development and quality of life (European Commission, Riga Conclusions, 2015). Coaching qualifications must therefore be re-considered in light of these developments. This is specially true in the case of youth sport. Approximately 80% of the 6-10 million coaches in Europe work with children. Most importantly, the majority of them are not qualified or hold low level qualifications. Those qualified tend to hold a generic qualification that does not prepare them to work specifically with 5-12 year-olds. As a result, there is a vast skills-gap between the world of coach education for coaches of children and the needs of the labour market. In turn, children are not receiving high quality coaching which increases attrition rates and reduces the chances of sport having a positive impact in their life. To start solving these issues, iCoachKids proposes the following project outputs:1. Report the children\u2019s coaching workforce in the seven European countries represented in the partnership to better understand its demography and needs 2. Case Study Compilation to capture examples of best practice in the education of children's coaches in VET.3.

The situation in the Central and Eastern European countries is even aggravated by the fact that the very first generation of entrepreneurs is approaching to retirement age so no previous experiment can be analysed on the transition period. \r\n\r\nCross- country and national research provide some comparative and national analysis of the succession phenomenon pointing out difficulties and risks and suggesting possible state interventions.  Though there is no homogeneous European strategy to cope with the very complex succession problems, important experience accumulated in the more advanced countries. This can be a good basis for homogenisation among the advanced countries on one side and adaptation and introduction of good practices in the post-socialist countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the proposal is, after having carried out exploratory and comparative research in the participating countries, to develop training materials for different target groups such as active owners and managers thinking about transfer of leadership and control in their companies, potential successors in leadership, and finally, mentors for companies where succession may need to be accompanied by scaling up or reorientation of activities. The resulting modules will cover legal, financial, social and cultural aspects of the succession process in the SMEs making differentiation between manufacturing and servicing companies.\r\n\r\nAn Institute from the south of France and Italian experts bring the Mediterranean experience, a British university and  Finnish experts  will introduce the Western and Nordic practice and a Polish university together with the Hungarian applicant will organise the research and the development of the different curricula.

It is estimated, however, that as many as 75 million adults in Europe lack basic reading skills, with many millions more lacking the confidence to engage with written texts of any complexity. At the same time, social and technological developments mean ever higher levels of literacy are needed at work and in civic life, requiring adults to engage in lifelong learning to maintain functional literacy. This requirement poses an additional challenge for adults with limited literacy, many of whom lack the skills and confidence for self-directed learning. To help address that challenge, this project will create a methodology and tools to support adults with limited literacy to become directors of their own literacy development, enabling them to maintain, improve and extend their skills. \r\n\r\nDrawing on established and emerging research on how to support literacy and language learning beyond the classroom, the project complements and reinforces existing investment in formal literacy learning. The model of learning proposed by the project is cost-effective and sustainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject objectives \r\n\r\nThe project intends to develop \r\n\r\n\u2022 Profile of competencies required for autonomous literacy learning\r\n\r\n\u2022 Curriculum of learning strategies to develop those competencies\r\n\r\n\u2022 Set of learner materials to support the curriculum\r\n\r\n\u2022 Learner portfolio which supports the learner to plan and evaluate learning\r\n\r\n\u2022 Profile of competencies required for coaching autonomous literacy learning\r\n\r\n\u2022 Development programme for autonomous literacy learning coaches\r\n\r\nIt will then pilot and evaluate these tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\n\r\nThe project will be carried out by six organisations from three countries. The countries involved are Germany, UK and The Netherlands. These organisations will be responsible for the project outcomes.\r\n\r\nSince all materials developed will be piloted extensively, greater numbers of participants will be involved. This includes in the first place 30-50 individuals with limited literacy, both L1 and L2 learners. They will be supported by at least 20 coaches, who will receive training in being a coach to literacy learners in order to develop their autonomy in improving and maintaining their literacy skills. \r\n\r\nCoaches will be expert language users. Some may be qualified literacy teachers, others volunteers from various walks of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to identify competencies required for self-directed literacy learning and create a learning programme that enables adults with limited literacy to develop those competencies and become autonomous literacy learners. That programme will include a portfolio-based curriculum and learning materials to support the curriculum.\r\n\r\nSupport for learners undertaking that programme will come from autonomous learning coaches and the project will create a secondary learning programme to develop these coaches. Again, the project proposes to first identify the competencies such coaches require and then design a learning programme to develop the requisite skills and knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter piloting this coach-development programme, the project will pilot its programme to enable adults with limited literacy to become autonomous literacy learners, supported by the coaches trained by the project.\r\n\r\nPiloting will take place in project partners\u2019 respective countries.

Since practical and theoretical experience were not available in the country BBS started bilateral and multipartner projects in order to adapt appropriate curricula taken from countries with long standing experience in SME issues. These projects have been implemented with varied partnerships forming by now a considerable European partner network for BBS. At a second stage BBS moved from adaptation to joint development of courses in more and more refined subject areas overarching SME problematics in all the partner countries. This made BBS one of the protagonists of SME realated trainings in Hungary. In recent projects BBS has followed the perception of the economic importance of SME Family Businesses (FBs) and has carried out research in and curiculum development for the FB sector. For a certain period of time BBS operated its SME projects in the field of vocational trainings (VET) and offered the results in the frame of adult education though proposing some modules as specialisation for regular HE students. Recent research and project experiences pointed out the need to employ stronger measures and mobilise the HE mastery of the school and the partners in order to meet the growing need of the FBs in long term theoretical and practical support. The inception of this demand came up simultaneously at several partner institutions and they immediately expressed their intention to develop a second year of a Master in entrepreneurship focusing on SME FB sustainability issues. They also recognised that this development must be preceded by a more in-depth research and they already started this research off-project, on their own expenses. The main vector of these research works has been identified as pointing from theories worked out for large companies to possible adaptations to SME FBs.The major objective of FAME project is a high level curriculum development underpinned by the results of the mentioned research.

The recent drastic rise in asylum applicants has placed increased pressure on Member States to develop strategies for effectively integrating new arrivals into society. Research has shown that education is one of the most important paths to the structural integration of young asylum seekers and refugees because they have particular social and emotional needs that quality education can help them overcome.  The project will contribute to filling these three gaps in the participating countries. The project ''Exchange of knowledge and good practice to enhance the education of refugee and sylum seeking youth'' (hereafter referred to as the RefuEdu project), is scheduled to run from (Sep 2016 to Apr 2017) and is based on the ongoing (Jan 2016 to Feb 2017) project PERAE that analyses the challenges that refugee and asylum seeking youth face in accessing and succeeding in education from an empirical point of view. The resulting analysis will identify challenges that youth face finds good practices in addressing those challenges and provide an overview of the interaction between the profile of each education system (with a focus on secondary education) and the migrants within it. The findings of the project compiled within national and a transnational comparative report will contribute to the initiation of transnational sharing of experience and good practice and to the development of policy and practice tools. This will be implemented through:- transnational mutual learning activities where stakeholders (school staff, decision makers, volunteers, social workers) will learn and exchange about good practices in refugee education,- a policy and practice Handbook on refugee and asylum seeker youth' education with indicators to track the adoption and implementation of the recommendations  for practitioners and policy makers dealing with the education of refugees and asylum seeking youth in policy and practice. - an international dissemination conference, stakeholders from all countries, from the EU level as well as representatives of refugee and asylum seeking youth will participate in the conference. The desired impact of the RefuEdu is to increase and improve ability of education stakeholders to deal with the particular situation refugee and asylum seeking youth are faced with, respond to their needs and support them in the development of their potentials. In addition,increased and improved ability of policy makers to respond to the particular situation refugee and asylum seeking youth are faced with through the formulation of policies which abandon barriers and foster the fast integration of this group into European education systems.

This question is central in Lille and the region, but also in our partners\u2019 territories. \r\nThe role of the citizen in that question is more and more raised nowadays. The main topic of this meeting could be expressed in one simple question : What kind of civil actions could be created to dynamize again industrials cities ?  \r\nThis meeting, proposed by Interphaz, will be an occasion to give to the debate new views from younth or experts. The association of theses publics, and the fact that they will meet various local actors are supposed to be a source of reflections, discoveries, and common productions. \r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTATS \r\nThose reflections and common productions are not supposed to be ephemeral.

More European countries are emphasising the importance of making visible and valuing learning that takes place outside formal education and training institutions, for example at work, in leisure time activities and at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, despite a number of initiatives and recommendations on the recognition of informal learning (c.f. European guidelines for validating non\u2011formal and informal learning, CEDEFOP) there is a wide gap between the recognition of formal and informal or non-formal learning. Access to the recognition of informal learning is patchy and the outcome of recognition process is  too often treated with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mozilla Open Badges, an initiative launched by the Mozilla Foundation in September 2011, provides a response to the needs for the recognition (formal and informal) of learning (formal and informal).  Open Badges are portable and verifiable, allowing learners to showcase work, document skill sets and competencies, and create a robust portrait of their abilities wherever they were acquired: whether in school, in the community, on the job or online. Millions of badges have already been delivered and the initiative has received the support from leading organisations in the field of education, business, policy and citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aims and objectives of Badge Europe, BEU (pronounced \u201cBe You\u201d) are to exploit the benefits of Open Badges to:\r\n\r\n- To create the conditions for a Europe-wide and world-wide recognition of learning achievements;\r\n\r\n- To open and facilitate the systematic access to the recognition of non-formal and informal learning;\r\n\r\n- To place formal and informal recognition of learning on a par; \r\n\r\n- To create new employment and learning opportunities for all; and\r\n\r\n- To bring a European contribution to the leadership of the world-wide Open Badge movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nBEU will be developing a network of organisations and practitioners to: \r\n\r\n- Promote the use of Open Badges for the recognition of learning;\r\n\r\n- Develop Open Badge initiatives at institutional/local/city/regional/national levels (e.g. Cities of Learning, developing the example of Chicago Summer of Learning - http://explorechi.org);\r\n\r\n- Promote Open Badges at policy levels;\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative practices in learning and employment; and\r\n\r\n- Make recommendations and implement improvements to the Open Badge Infrastructure, technologies and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose activities will be carried out directly, with the support of Open Workshops (6) and of a MOOC.

The are increasingly being explored for use within formal education, and by employers. They are particularly valuable for supporting transitions between learning and the world of work. This is because of the verified data they can convey, including the issuing organisation, links to evidence and learning standards - all linked to the individual's identity. The other advantage of Open Badges is their portability and visibility in an electronic world - they can be shared across various online platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Certificate Supplement was designed to make vocational education and training qualifications more transparent both within, but particularly between, European member states. Whilst widely issued in some member states, it is less well known in others. The reasons for this vary and are dependant on each national context. \r\n\r\nIn its standard form, the Certificate Supplement is a generic document, specific to the individual, but in some member states, the Certificate Supplement is an individualised supplement - essentially an enhanced transcript - that provides a record of what a student actually achieved.\r\n\r\nESCO is a multilingual taxonomy for skills, competences, qualifications, and occupations and provides a common language for recording skills / learning outcomes required for particular occupations and qualifications. \r\n\r\nWhat these tools have in common is that they were designed to support the transition between learning (formal / non-formal / informal) and the world of work.\r\n\r\nABECS will seek to combine the best attributes of electronic transcripts, the Certificate Supplements and ESCO and incorporate them in a modern, portable, verified, shareable, visible, electcronic package - an Open Badge.  The project will pilot these badges in specific sectors across all the partner countries with carefully selected qualifications that can provide proof of concept.\r\n\r\nThe six partners involved in the project derive from five member states have been chosen for their knowledge and experience in various areas including Open Badges, digital student data and digital credentials, ESCO expertise, development of certificate banks and Certificate Supplement databases, electronic transcripts, individualised Certificate Supplements and curriculum development, to name a few. \r\n\r\nTo achieve the project aim of developing enhanced electronic transcripts in the form of an individualised Certificate Supplement, using ESCO terminology and packaged as an open badge, the partners will utilise a phased methodology to:\r\n- Select test qualifications for which occupation information already exists in ESCO and are offered across all partner member states - preferable in sectors with high rates of international mobility. \r\n- Establish the content for the Open Badges by reviewing existing Certificate Supplement data (where available) and cross referencing to ESCO terminology and other occupational data\r\n- Develop / adapt / utilise an Open Badge issuing platform and establish how to populate the platform / badges with the credential content.\r\n- Develop guidance information for awarding institutions / organisations and learners to guide them through the issuance process and how to share the Badges once in receipt in order to optimise their visibility and use by employers as part of their recruitment - in particular sharing them via online media.\r\n- Test methods for populating and issuing the Certificate Supplements as Open Badges\r\n- Reviewing the information included in the badge, translations into project partner languages and consistency of the learning outcomes.\r\n- Present the results of the pilot study in a report / presentation along with guidance for up-scaling the pilot across other qualifications, awarding institutions / bodies / sectors, member states, etc.\r\n- Disseminate these results to partner stakeholder networks and more widely using appropriate media.\r\n- Hold a multiplier event to share the results / guidance to stakeholders and gather feedback.\r\n\r\nThe aim of ABECS is to develop a workable model for issuing enhanced transcripts in the form of individualised Certificate Supplements using ESCO terminology, in multiple languages in an Open Badge format, and for those Open Badges to be shared and distributed to employers and other end users via online media such as LinkedIn.  The longer term impact that the project intends to achieve is that the pilot demonstrates the feasibility of this model and that is is duplicated widely across Europe, hopefully including adoption by the European Commission into the new Europass portfolio.

We propose the development of a cost effective 2 stage system, firstly, the heat treatment process which will preserve the timber will use a novel microwave based technology to directly heat the timber.

Four flagship workflows (from @neurIST, euHeart, VPHOP, Virolab) provide existing data, tools and models, engage with the services developed by VPH-Share to drive the development of the infostructure, and pilot its applications. Data sources are usually clinical data from individual patients - medical images and/or biomedical signals - sometimes with population information. The operations range from secure access and storage through annotation, data inference and assimilation, to complex image processing and physics-based mathematical modelling, to data reduction and representation. The project focuses on a key bottleneck: the interface with the wealth of data from medical research infrastructures and from clinical processes. VPH-Share will provide the essential services, as well as the computational infrastructure, for the sharing of clinical and research data and tools, facilitating the construction and operation of new VPH workflows, and collaborations between the members of the VPH community.
