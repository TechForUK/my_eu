The continuous professional development and the intrinsic force to be innovative and open to reforms changed the teachers as well as the students of Budapest 2nd District Szab\u00f3 L\u0151rinc Bilingual Primary and Secondary School for ever. This year\u2019s project is titled \"New Dimensions in Bilingual Education\" in the framework of which 16 colleagues take part in various mobility programmes. The project summarizes the most important outcomes of the mobility activities and their possible effects. It includes taking part in courses and job shadowing. Courses benefit all levels of the school from lower and upper primary to secondary, both the bilingual and the language preparation classes through the acquisition of intercultural and ICT competencies, new methods and teaching/thinking strategies. The job shadowing activities are all connected to the previous projects and our eTwinning network. Job shadowing has contributed to the school\u2019s internationalisation to a great extent.  \r\n\r\nThe mobilities in harmony with the strategic development plan of the school contribute to \r\n- the development of a high command of English and German indispensable to the effective multifaceted communication inside and outside school\r\n- the extension of the number of bilingual subjects\r\n- the classroom material design for bilingual subjects\r\n- the training of professional personnel for bilingual education\r\n- the methodological and professional revival of the teaching staff\r\n- the promotion of using ICT and project-based strategies in all classes\r\n- the continuous professional self-training of the teaching staff\r\n- the motivation of students\r\n- the cooperation and teambuilding of the partakers\r\n- helping in the integration of non-Hungarian students\r\n- the successful integration of students with special needs\r\n- the enforcement of the European Dimensions in the school\r\n- helping with keeping the school in the European educational mainstream\r\n\r\nThis project is the continuation of the development that was started earlier. The school successfully complies with the regulations of bilingual education and effectively prepares students for the advanced level Matura exams. One of the school\u2019s new head teacher\u2019s major goals is to implement the cutting-edge methodology of the Western European educational system into our teaching process. The targeted mobility activities offer great possibilities to gain insight to the freshest knowledge / know-how available. The front-line methodology and ICT technologies motivate students and revitalize the lessons. Thanks to our expanding international network the students can practise the English and German languages with more efficiency. The project also helps us prepare for the realisation of the Digital Educational Strategy. Beside the teaching competencies, some transversal competencies are developed as well, such as learning abilities, communication, problem solving and the leadership and management skills, not to mention creativity and the ability to take part in teamwork.\r\n\r\nWhen planning this project, we were very specific to pay attention to all the details and needs of the whole school and its sections. We have been preparing very carefully so as to be able to collect the most diverse and variable experiences during the mobility activities. During the planning of the application, different liabilities were assigned, all partakers contributed to the compilation of the project design. The whole team keeps in touch and cooperates during the project and represents the school and the country to the best of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nA great emphasis has been put on the dissemination of the knowledge gained during the mobility activities. All partakers have the possibility to disseminate the practices they have acquired on various platforms. We have already established a new educational tradition in our district, which is titled the Professional Day in Pasar\u00e9t. This is a dissemination event where colleagues can share their experience gained during their mobility.\r\n\r\nThe most visible and immediate effect of the Erasmus+ mobility applications was that the colleagues taking part in the programme started to think together as a cohesive team for the good of the school and its students. The various mobility activities in the long run contribute to the school\u2019s innovation and open new professional dimensions.\r\n\r\nAll applying colleagues find that the programme engulfs in significant linguistic development, intercultural experience and professional revival, and all these help to impede the process of burning out. In a broader context, this mobility programme means a high quality jump towards the future, a development in the abilities necessary to meet international educational expectations and to get in the mainstream system of European schools.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever world offers you, curiosity will make you see it the way you want it.\" (L\u0151rinc Szab\u00f3: Curiosity)", "http://www.robinhoodprimary.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA101-047352_3"], ["0PB", "Problem Solving for Tomorrow", "Chilcote Primary School", 47900.0, "'Problem Solving for tomorrow' is a project that will address needs clearly identified by both institutions independently: Chilcote in England and Sem in Norway. They have ascertained a clear correlation between the poor teaching of problem solving and pupils\u2019 ability to face real life challenges. This is reflected in pockets of low attainment, motivation, confidence and attitudes towards Mathematics, particularly of less able children - many of whom are from poor socio-economic backgrounds. However, all pupils need to improve in problem solving, as it is an area of weakness throughout each school. So the challenge is to improve best practice and prepare pupils to be the problems solvers of tomorrow who are ready for the world of work. \r\n\r\nBoth schools have already begun to tackle these issues, but a more innovative, focused and transnational approach is needed to ensure the maximum impact is achieved and that the impact is embedded in curriculum planning, pedagogy and methodology. As Chilcote and Sem have a well sustained and developed eleven year relationship (including 3 successful Comenius projects), it is felt they have a deep understanding of each other\u2019s aims, priorities, needs and culture that will provide an excellent base and enable them to focus together on the new complex challenges ahead. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop the methodology of teaching and pedagogy surrounding the area of Mathematical Practical Problem Solving, enhancing the skills of both staff and pupils. A particular focus of this project will be early intervention for pupils who are at risk of 'falling behind' and are unable to access the curriculum. Both Chilcote and Sem desire all pupils to master problem solving through creative and innovate approaches, preparing them for their place in the job market of tomorrow. This is a priority for both schools and would have an embedded, long term impact across each institution on all involved  (850 pupils and staff). \r\n\r\nThe project will consist of eight mobilities over a three year period, with a variety of activities and projects in-between. There will be four project meetings, two staff training activities and two pupil activities.  From these there will be the creation of a staff problem solving training programme; a film documenting the project and best practice; and a detailed report into the findings, impact and a future action plan which will be used in dissemination activities, including multiplier events. \r\n\r\nThe planning meetings will focus on setting universal baseline assessment methods, identifying specific needs and planning training to deal with these, evaluating throughout and ensuring effective dissemination take place. The staff training will ensure all understand the aims and objectives and have the skills to deliver high quality teaching through workshops and tasks.\r\n\r\nThe pupil activities will focus on problem solving within a budget and then taking part in problem solving activities together within each diverse setting and involving local businesses. Finally, the project will come to a close where all processes and activities will be evaluated and the next steps for continuing to develop mathematical problem solving and ensuring sustainability will be formulated.\r\n\r\nThe use of ICT as a sharing platform and to enable staff and pupils to innovate will be central. The learning platform, blogs and skype will be among the tools used by staff and pupils to: share ideas and best practice; post problems and approaches used; develop relationships and intercultural understanding. They will also be used to disseminate and involve stakeholders and the wider community in the project; any area which is seen as vital and pivotal to the success of the project. \r\n\r\nThe curriculums of each institution will be strengthened as innovative approaches to problem solving will be embedded into the curriculum through the development of pedagogy and methodologies. Teachers will be more confident in teaching problem solving, having developed their understanding, strategies and best practice. Pupils will be more skilled and able to tackle problems using a variety of strategies confidently, which will foster a love of lifelong learning and prepare them for the European workplace.  \r\n\r\nChanges will be embedded into the curriculum so outcomes are long lasting and continue to evolve, sharing resources and results with other institutions to support their development. The clearly sustainable link between schools will continue to develop, with a particular focus on staff and pupil mobility to develop further understanding of problem solving and forge a new path ahead for continual growth with a vision to provide excellent teaching and learning.", "http://www.chilcoteschool.com", "Chilcote Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013707_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B28"}
