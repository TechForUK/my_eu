Additionally, there are small livestock farms and service and merchant transportation.The school has 8 grades: 2 Pre-School grades and 6 Primary School grades, with 107 enrolled students and a faculty of 15 teachers open to new proposals and reflective over proper teaching practices.- The Bilingual Seccion in English has been offered in our school since the 2008-2009 academic year in the fields of Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Arts and Crafts. French is also offered in our school as a second foreign language in the 5th and 6th grades of Primary. The school has three teachers with B2 and C1 levels of English who are responsible for the bilingual project.- The educational and cultural level of the families is heterogeneous, even though the trend is toward greater levels of education than some years ago. The economic crisis has seriously affect this zone. A large part of the lumber businesses have closed; consequently the income levels of the families have worsened.- The school receives sufficient social recognition from the families, and generally, from the administrations and institutions on which they depend or with which they associate.NECESSITIES:1- Our students live in a setting that offers them few possibilities to learn a second language; for this reason our School has committed itself to reinforcing the educational offerings in the linguistic areas: English and French. Additionally it is committed to the development of a Bilingual Project (Spanish-English) in non-linguistic areas: Sciences and Art. This demands a CONTINUOUS methodological development of the faculty that imparts these areas.2- Being a Primary School with a bilingual section, we are very interested in a smooth transition to Secondary Education for our students. Consequently, we have a need to know the manner in which other European bilingual schools organize this transition and to exchange experiences.3- Our school is situated in a lowly populated community. Because of this, we need to create a modern and dynamic setting that is open to a multicultural and international environment in order to foster tolerance among our students. This search for the internationalization of our school makes it necessary to maintain a continuous development by way of new methodology and teaching practices with other schools of the European Community.4.- Being a Primary and Pre-School educational center, we feel the necessity to broaden our knowledge of methodologies directed toward teaching phonetics from the first years of schooling, as well as the use of new technologies for its application.OBJECTIVES:1.-To be in contact with other educational systems different to our own, to exchange experiences and to better personal and professional abilities.2.-To acquire new methodological strategies in the teaching of CLIL (Arts and Sciences) courses.3.-To promote the internationalization of our school creating a permanent European space of learning and creating a network of collaboration among teachers of distinct European educational centers.PROFILE OF PARTICIPATING FACULTY:- Pre-School English teacher: level B2 of English and 3 years of service.- English and bilingual courses Primary teacher: level B2 of English and 9 years of service.- Coordinator of the school\u00b4s bilingual project, English and bilingual courses  Primary teacher: level C1 of English and 22 years of service.ACTIVITIES:1- Two STRUCTURED COURSES that provide the faculty with strategies and an innovative methodology for the teaching of a second language, and new tools in the teaching of CLIL areas, phonetics, and English culture.2- A PERIOD OF OBSERVATION in a European Primary Education Center, that prioritizes in its educational offerings the intercultural and plurilingual development and a correct transition to Secondary Education.METHODOLOGY TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECTThe faculty will integrate the methodological tools and acquired experiences in the classroom\u00b4s daily activities, giving a reflection or \"feedback\" over the Mobility\u00b4s conclusions and over the degree of its application in our school.IMPACT:- Sharing the experience with the network of CLIL schools in Castilla y Le\u00f3n.- Diffusing the acquired competencies by way of formative courses and the school\u00b4s web.POSSIBLE BENEFITS:- Formation of associations and consortia with other educational centers.", "http://www.windrushprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024806_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SE28"}
