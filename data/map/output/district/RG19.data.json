The key enabling technologies to be deployed are:\n- additive manufacturing, for polymeric and metallic frames\n- advanced coating technologies, for short series lens coating\n- automated procedures, for personalisable frames catalogue design\n- scanning devices, for end-user anthropometric data capture\nICT tools will be used to improve the efficiency, adaptability and sustainability of the production systems and their integration within the proximity mini-factory business model. It requires continuous change of processes related to the management of distributed manufacturing assets and to the personalised manufacturing of spectacles in which the consumer can select frame materials and also finishings both in frame and lenses.\nOptician2020 will demonstrate the feasibility of this business model based on close-to-optician mini-factories by showing:\n- The spectacles personalisation flexibility, developing a catalogue of at least 12 models in spectacles for 450 users.\n- The mini-factories flexibility and re-configurability with an agile procedure for adding new local manufacturing facilities to the open virtual network.\n- The time-to-market reduction up to 65% and production cost reduction of 40% with respect to conventional methods.\nThe exploitation will start one year after the completion of Optician2020. A maximum initial impact of 25.000 spectacles can be obtained with two initial clusters of networked minifactories working efficiently for a group of 12 opticians in each cluster. It is expected to expanding the number of mini-factories with 10 more EU-based clusters.", 302716.0, 4499119.0, "OPTICIAN2020", null, null, null, null, "http://www.3trpd.co.uk", null, "fp7_109550_972066392"], ["4NR", "European Initiative to Enable Validation for Highly Automated Safe and Secure Systems", "The Motor Insurance Repair Researchcentre", "ENABLE-S3 will pave the way for accelerated application of highly automated and autonomous systems in the mobility domains automotive, aerospace, rail and maritime as well as in the health care domain. Virtual testing, verification and coverage-oriented test selection methods will enable validation with reasonable efforts. The resulting validation framework will ensure Europeans Industry competitiveness in the global race of automated systems with an expected market potential of 60B\u20ac in 2025.\nProject results will be used to propose standardized validation procedures for highly automated systems (ACPS). \nThe technical objectives addressed are: \n1. Provision of a test and validation framework that proves the functionality, safety and security of ACPS with at least 50% less test effort than required in classical testing. \n2. Promotion of a new technique for testing of automated systems with physical sensor signal stimuli generators, which will be demonstrated for at least 3 physical stimuli generators. \n3. Raising significantly the level of dependability of automated systems due to provision of a holistic test and validation platform and systematic coverage measures, which will reduce the probability of malfunction behavior of automated systems to 10E-9/h. \n4. Provision of a validation environment for rapid re-qualification, which will allow reuse of validation scenarios in at least 3 development stages. \n5. Establish open standards to speed up the adoption of the new validation tools and methods for ACPS. \n6. Enabling safe, secure and functional ACPS across domains. \n7. Creation of an eco-system for the validation and verification of automated systems in the European industry. ENABLE-S3 is strongly industry-driven. Realistic and relevant industrial use-cases from smart mobility and smart health will define the requirements to be addressed and assess the benefits of the technological progress.", 12700.0, 56042753.0, "ENABLE-S3", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_203396_930574739"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RG19"}
