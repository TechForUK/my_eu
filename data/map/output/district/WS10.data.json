Batteries Limited", "The COLABATS project will provide new industrial processes for the recycling of the critical metals Cobalt and Lanthanides and key economic metals Nickel and Lithium, from waste batteries, significantly improving recycling efficiencies and metal purity from existing recovery routes. Primarily Li-ion and NiMH will be targeted using novel task specific ionic liquids (TSILs) to selectively extract the metals. These batteries are found in everyday consumer products such as mobile phones, portable media players, etc., as well as other industrial equipment, and are prevalent in hybrid and electric vehicles, which are becoming increasingly widespread on our roads.\nTSILs are molecules covalently tethered to a functional group. Targeted species will be low-cost, non-toxic, environmentally benign, and will require minimal or no processing to reuse them.\nThe battery recycling processes will be up-scaled to a pilot system using standard hydrometallurgical equipment and will include other novel concepts to further improve the process. The pilots will be operated in an industrial setting at battery recycling plants and demonstrated to the wider recycling and battery communities.\nThe technology will result in:\n\u2022 Substantially reducing landfill waste by recovering recyclable metals of high purity\n\u2022 Reducing critical metal consumption by increasing recycling efficiencies of spent battery waste. Hence, high purity recovered metals can be recycled into new batteries rather than landfilling or in the case of nickel, processed into lower value stainless steel.\n\u2022 Substantially reducing environmental impact by introducing more sustainable hydrometallurgical processing to replace current standard pyrometallurgical processes. This will reduce energy consumption and emissions of CO2 and other pollutants.\n\u2022 Increasing the capability of the SME community to carry out the complete recycling process, thereby taking advantage of the potential value chain of critical and high value metals markets.", 45821.0, 3590857.0, "COLABATS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.g-pbatt.co.uk", null, "fp7_111072_952962630"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9PN", "L\u00e4ra genom internationalisering", "St Mary's Catholic Primary School", 25710.0, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden, has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work. The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.stmaryswednesbury.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WS10"}
