In micro-systems, the costs of packaging can be up to 80% of total production costs. Technological advances to reduce packaging costs are therefore of pivotal importance to maintain the competitive edge of assembly companies. Moreover, with the exodus of high volume packaging and assembly companies to low-wage countries such as China and India, the manufacturing industry in Europe needs to revitalise itself by encouraging design and innovation that will allow European companies to produce assembly equipment and materials of tomorrow that will feed into the Asian market. Our approach of using microwave technology in bonding has significant advantages over technologies made available in the market. In our approach we don\u2019t need a closed microwave oven. Through the open design we can do the placement, alignment and curing at the same time. The use of this technology in reel-to-reel manufacturing will be possible. Due to the higher level of integration and signifcantly shorter cycle times this new technology will give European packaging companies a clear competitive advantage particularly over their US competitors. Quality of the bonds will be improved as well due to better selectivity and special designed materials as well as the precisely adaptable frequency of the microwave. It uses pulsed microwave sources and relies on the selection of a few resonant cavities frequencies that are jittered (mode hopping). The two characteristics permit not only the avoidance of electrical discharges through arcing, but also the accurate curing of the paste at the location of interest, i.e. at the interface between a die and the substrate for example in the case of DCA.

The multi-departmental dimension of our school (under the supervision of 3 ministries : the Ministry of Education, the ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development) and its location in a tourist area encourage the commitment and involvement of our staff. England, Portugal, Italy, Norway, the Czech Republic, Germany, and more recently Turkey and Bulgaria have provided us with stable partnerships on the previous Leonardo / ERASMUS + K1 and Comenius / ERASMUS + K2 programmes.\r\n\r\nOur school's international openness has undeniably given added value that can be measured at different levels:\r\n\r\n1/ Students have acquired strong cultural benefits, strengthened language skills, specific technical and professional knowledge related to the country, European citizenship-based autonomy development, a greater willingness to access higher education after the mobility, increased employability.\r\n\r\n2/ Our vocational school has gained a broader permanent partnership with European companies which shows the quality of the work of the teachers involved in the project, having a great impact on our school's reputation and image.\r\n\r\n3/ Our host companies have received new contributions on the French vocational training supplemented by the exchange of knowledge, they have shown their commitment and satisfaction for 6 years.\r\n\r\nOur 'OSE !' project is designed for 20 male and female students, aged 17 to 19 in their second year BTEC National.

Indeed, 'OSE !' must enable students at risk of dropping out of school to give meaning to their learning process. Our priority objective is to help our potential school dropouts continue their studies. We want to improve achievement for all students thanks to European mobility, to help them believe in themselves and in their capabilities so they can start building their own future with a diploma. No pupil shall leave school without qualifications. Our 'OSE!' challenge is to reduce our school dropout rate.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the objectives for the students are to acquire new skills :\r\n\r\n1/ professional skills: exchanging practices, implementing the acquired know-how, discovering new techniques, producing weekly reports about their activities sent by email - expected results: improved computer skills by validating their Information Technology and Internet Proficiency Certificate (B2i) if necessary, a validated training period in compliance with the training framework and curriculum, an enhanced EUROPASS CV and EUROPASS MOBILITY.\r\n\r\n2/ social and personal skills: taking the international dimension into account when looking for a job, giving meaning to one's Education, even improving school ambition by choosing to continue in higher education, developing new abilities such as adaptability, mobility, curiosity, autonomy, a desire to discover new lifestyles and working habits - expected results: an increased self-confidence, better communication skills, a better approach when solving problems and dealing with stressful situations.\r\n\r\n3/ language and cultural skills: developing language skills, visiting historical and geographical landmarks in England, Germany and Portugal -expected results: CEFR B1 level  reached (Common European Framework) in listening and interacting, oral presentation and validating the optional mobility unit.\r\n\r\nOurs school aims at increasing partnership work with European companies and improving its image thanks to innovative actions and through the quality of its international openness.
