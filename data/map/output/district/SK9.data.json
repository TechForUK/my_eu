Main idea for this project is that after successful implementations in topics such as district heating, energy grids, local energy generation, energy efficiency for housing, now it is time for the next big step:  integrated flexible open infrastructures.\n\nThe approach  taken is the set-up of stakeholder teams in the demonstrator cities, to accelerate the realization of energy-efficient city development. This effort is supported by technology teams including industrial parties. Workshops aiming at decreasing the gap between innovation and implementation will be organized and knowledge-disclosing material will be developed by specialized working groups in retrofitting, smart grids, and heating and cooling. This approach holds for both technology and process improvement.\n\nThe demonstrators in Amsterdam and Grenoble include retrofitting 105000 m2 of housing to levels down to 53 kWh/m2, showing average savings of the order of 80%. Furthermore they include fully-functional smart grid development, electricity storage demonstrators, free cooling schemes and district heating efficiency improvements.\n\nThe City-zen project recognizes the key position of citizens, so ample attention is paid to dissemination and education of this group. Serious gaming is included as part of the work, as well as a roadshow bringing the results of the project right at the doorsteps of decision makers in other cities.\n\nExtensive monitoring of all buildings and installations is included.\n\nAll demonstrators together have an estimated impact of 59000 tonne/year  CO2 reduction.

These are known as \"transversal competences\", \u201csoft skills\u201d or even \u201clife skills\u201d, acquired through an informal learning process. We speak about skills such as teamwork, culture of effort, motivation to achieve goals, effective communication, frustration tolerance, dealing with success and failure, decision making, emotional control, self-esteem, adaptive capacity, flexibility, initiative, control and reduction of stress or time/stress management, among others.In this way, ELIT-in project will be framed in the specific objective of the promotion of dual careers of athletes, being its main aim to work, through an innovative approach, for the recognition of transversal competences acquired by high performance athletes throughout their careers and to put them in value as a differential factor for accessing to the labour market with full guarantees once they retire.", "http://www.manchestermagicandmystics.co.uk", null, "erasmus_590520-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-SPO-SCP_5"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3JA", "GREATER MANCHESTER COMMUNITY BASKETBALL AND SPORTS ASSOCIATION LIMITED", 29992.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_33557", 2017], ["5PX", "RISK & ASSURANCE INSIGHTS LIMITED*", 5670.0, "Other management expenditure (28.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_51102", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK9"}
