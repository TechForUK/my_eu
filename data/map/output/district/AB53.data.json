We have been looking at how we can plan for French teaching from nursery to primary seven which will aide the transition into secondary school.  As as staff we wish to participate in the LFEE Europe Immersion course to Lyon, France.  At present, the staff have a range of expertise from our French specialist to the rest of the staff who are trying to improve their French through various courses, apps and books.  As a school we are implementing some of our French training to-date with all classes.  We are all open to new ideas for teaching French and are very keen and enthusiastic to develop our own expertise and teaching strategies.  We are looking forward to opening up channels of communication between UK schools and schools in Europe with the use of ICT such as Skype, FaceTime, e-resources, portals, e-twinning and e-mail.  The course is an ideal opportunity to make connections with a school in France.\r\n\r\nParticipating in the immersion course will allow all members of staff to boost their confidence and competency when teaching French.  Through preparation for and immersion in the language throughout the course, the staff will build upon their French conversation, listening and writing skills.  New ideas, methodologies and resources will strengthen all of our class teacher pedagogies in relation to regular planned exposure to French throughout the school.  Equally important is the development of cultural awareness and access to relevant resources to take back to New Deer School. \r\n\r\nOn returning from the immersion course, New Deer School plans to share their experiences with the local community, staff, parents and pupils, as well as the Mintlaw Cluster group of schools.

Aberdeenshire is implementing this mission, and Markethill School, as one of the biggest schools in Aberdeenshire, has a significant role to play in this. Having started this year with the implementation of 1+2 and being a keen promoter of European languages and its cultural aspects, we hope to continue on this path and be leaders in modern language teaching in Scotland, fully implementing 1+2 several years in advance, for the benefit of our children in an ever more globalised and linked world. We will help to pilot and lead the way with the second foreign language, the L3, for this coming school year.\r\n\r\nChallenges in terms of competencies, confidence, methodology, and more, all have to be worked on. Spanish needs to be introduced as our second language, confidence and methodology in French needs to be developed for those new to it, and progression, evaluation, and new methods need to be gained in order to keep progressing with French year after year. This is where the LFEE immersion courses, accredited by the GTCS, will be incredibly useful and beneficial to us as a school. The Malaga, Spain course will give our modern languages ambassador the knowledge and tools to come out of class and teach Spanish to all of our older pupils as his main role. The French follow up course, set in southern France, will allow us to continue the progression of French in our school, develop our French knowledge, and come up with new and innovative ways to keep French learning alive in our school, year after year. Finally, the introductory course in Salignac, France, will help to improve methodological and pedagogical expertise in the teaching of French to primary school children and increase the teachers' knowledge of French as as language. All three courses will provide our participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of French and Spanish at primary level, develop a greater cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France and Spain, and improve our participants' competence and performance in French and Spanish as well as the  use of the internet and other ICT resources in classes to teach French and Spanish, all meanwhile getting to live and experience the French and Spanish languages and the cultural side of France and Spain.\r\n\r\nOur participants are our modern languages ambassador (for two courses), management (2), and keen members of staff (4), all of whom are keen promoters of modern languages and the European contexts in teaching, thus setting the stage perfectly for gaining the most out of these courses -- as well as then being able to give the most back upon the return to our school. The Spanish course will allow for its introduction, and the follow up French course being attended by both the ambassador and management will ensure the successful progression of French at the school.

It will also allow us to broaden the experiences pupils get when learning French, by allowing them to have an increased cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary France. This will give us increased ability to promote global citizenship in line with the national curriculum in Scotland. Teachers will become more confident that they are teaching using best practice, up-to-date methodologies suitable for the age and stage of their pupils, embedding languages as part of the everyday school routine, and will have access to new, relevant resources to support this.\r\n\r\nThe two teachers who plan to attend the course both have different backgrounds and experience; currently one teaches middle stages while the other teaches upper stages but has recently taught the lower stages. Both participants have experience of leading curriculum development work within the school and the whole staff team is a very supportive one, who are used to working closely together to build on the experience of team members to improve learning and teaching throughout the school and increase opportunities for our learners. \r\n\r\nAt Fyvie Primary School we plan to embrace French as a medium for some routine daily communication within the school and for use in celebrations. We intend to have signs up around the school in French as well as English, Doric and with appropriate \u2018Total Communication\u2019 symbols, making all our signage inclusive as well as making French part of the everyday life of the school.  \r\nTraining sessions will be run in school to share knowledge and resources with other staff and parent workshops may be organised so that the whole school community will be impacted by the upskilling of staff, leading to a greater use of French in everyday routines around the school.

We may twin our school with another school in Europe and share our experiences with them.\r\n\r\nIn the future we envisage that our learners will have increased opportunities to experience other languages and cultures and increase their awareness of how people live in other countries, comparing and contrasting that with their own lives. They will have the opportunity to improve their overall language skills and widen their relevant and transferable skills which would potentially be of interest to international employers in an increasingly globalised world; we want our learners to have the maximum number of possibilities for their future employment and gain experiences which may not be available to those who can only speak one language.", "http://fyvie.sch@aberdeenshire.gov.uk", "Fyvie Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046851_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB53"}
