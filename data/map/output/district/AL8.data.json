K\u00e4o Elementary School has been running for the past three years, therefore getting important information from other schools\u2019 experiences could be necessary. Even though it is possible to find similar schools in Estonia, teachers still need to further their knowledge in other countries where they have longer history in that field. K\u00e4o Elementary School works closely with K\u00e4o Day Care Center \u2013 it enables students to get different therapies (occupational therapy, music therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy etc.). K\u00e4o Day Care Centre educators help students during their schoolday and in the afternoon. \r\n\r\nThe main goals for the project are:\r\n- examine the use of intensive interaction and ABA, which are essential part of working with autistic children. According to K\u00e4o Elementary School, these methods are not widespread in Estonia.\r\n- examine different augmentative and alternative communication opportunities that are used in UK special needs schools\r\n- examine different opportunities for sensory rooms\r\n- get knowledges about planning a lessons and schoolday for students with severe cognitive/ developmental and multiple disabilities \r\n- get knowledges about how teachers cooperate with other professionals (social workers, occupational therapists, music therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists etc.).\r\n\r\nThere will be three teachers participating in the job shadowing in special education schools in England. All the teachers have their own (home)groups. Additionally, they teach following subjects to all studens: cognition and perception; art and fine motor skills; social relationships and group work. Therefore teachers need to use augmentative and alternative communication and intensive interaction every day. Even though all the partner schools have students with severe with severe cognitive/ developmental disabilities, each school has an individual approach that the teachers from K\u00e4o Elementary School would like to familiarize with. \r\n\r\nDuring the job shadowing, teachers can broaden their knowledge and get practical experience working with similar study methods. Gained knowledge could raise the competency that again would help to create better environment for a personal growth in obtaining secondary education according to ones capabilities. With this current project, K\u00e4o Elementary School is also hoping to find long time partners from abroad with whom the partnership could continue even after the project. \r\n\r\nThe main communication between partners will take place via email (through the contact person of the school). Schools in England offer suitable dates for the job shadowing. Main goals of the visit will be specified again prior to travel. \r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing, all the participating teachers share the new information and knowledges with the staff of K\u00e4o Elementary School, K\u00e4o Day Care Center and parents. Additionally, all the relevant information about the project will be revealed on the schools\u00b4 official website.

We actively support these international mobilities, not only in Europe but also in developing countries.  The objective is to create more awareness of the growing globalisation and the  impact it has on our lifestyle and the economic development in Europe and beyond. We want to make them realize that a united Europe and a good cooperation between the member states are crucial for a stable economic Europe.  A very actual en critical situation with the number of refugees entering Europe.We aim at offering challenging education in general, not only by creating an international programme of Excellence abroad for our VET+ students of level 4EQF but we also look for possibilities for developing the talents of our students with a socially challenged background by offering them a life changing experience abroad. More specifically : 1. Entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial  attitude and  behaviour:Our students of level 4+EQF are more and more aware of the fact that they need to make their own choices in life in order to be economically and financially independent in an early stage of their life. The situation in Europe requires a more personified and individualized career path to reach personal goals. Our objective is to empower students in realizing a fulfilling, satisfying, fruitful life and career, either in Europe or in our region . Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship is a good source for empowerment.  Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level.Teachers and students wil be trained abroad within the companies involved. This enables students to develop the 4  Binckley 2020 competences of 21st century skills : creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration.  This training enables students to start up companies as start-ups or pop-ups while studying.  As part of that process we will also focus on Job-carving, former jobs defined in a new way and transferred into  new settings. That requires new curricula and new training methods which will be , developed  in collaboration with our international partners.Our partners will be triggered to implement the newly developed methods in their own region in order to inspire young  people starting their own businesses.2. Quality of  workplacements. Our continuous goal is to maintain the high standard of qualilty of our placements abroad by using solid and renomated training companies,  by consulting the Dutch recognition organisation SBB, the intermediate organisations in the host country and by using the network of our educational partners abroad . 3. Special attention will be paid to placement for our level 2 students, the socially challenged group of youngsters who we offer an experience abroad in order to improve their position in the labour market. 4. ECVET and EQF :   Description of Learning Units and Learning Outcomes by the educational team at Friesland College in collaboration with our international partners remains one of the objectives of this project.  The MOU, Europass and other European instruments for agreements on content, on monitoring, validation, recognition and evaluation of the experiences abroad are still in progress of developing. They are the key for a succesful study period abroad. 5. Focus on professionals in training in view of our Programme of Excellence which had been developed this year. Excellent students require excellent professionals. Extra material will be offered in the programme and therefore professionals will go abroad in order to find new teaching methods The exchanging of teaching methods,  training,  job- shadowing and intercultural sensitivity with foreign colleagues will contribute to a broader view on cultural values. The teachers are in their turn  enabled to pass these values on to their students. To partake in  foreign courses, classes or trainings the schools finance a fair part of the costs themselves.", "http://www.brocket-hall.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA102-022711_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AL8"}
