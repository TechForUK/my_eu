We are around 15 teachers, working in teams with the students: 6-7 years old, 8-9 years old and 10-12 years old.\r\nAt Nykyrka school we work with planning, assessment, increasing the motivation of our students and making them aware of the goals of the curriculum. We try to develop new and innovative methods of using ICT. Every student at Nykyrka school has got a tablet of their own.  We emphasize work concerning the students\u00b4 wellbeing and self-esteem, in order to prevent any kind of harassment or discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe cooperate with the University of Link\u00f6ping, and teachers at Nykyrka school supervise teacher candidates from abroad. We wish to continue with international cooperations in various ways, as a part of our strive towards Nykyrka school being a school with an international profile.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of an earlier Erasmus+ project has meant a lot for our school-development, therefore we once more would like to send in an application for job-shadowing activities.\r\nWe would like to exchange educational experiences through job-shadowing at St Stephen\u00b4s Church of England Primary School in South Godstone, Surrey, England. That would help our teachers to gain a global perspective about education and it will ultimately benefit both our teachers and our pupils.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\nAt Nykyrka school we have a need to learn more about how to include children with all sorts of special needs, (physically disabled, visually impaired, ADHD, autism, oppositional disorders etc). Our municipality of Motala has made a decision that from autumn 2017 there will be no small educational groups for these children any more, everyone should be included and integrated in ordinary classes.  In the Municipality of Motala we have many newly-arrived people from different countries, so we are also interested in this kind of includation.\r\n\r\nNykyrka school is a school with only Swedish-born children at the moment, therefore we need to teach respect for and appreciation of the world around us and promote tolerance, understanding and respect for moral and cultural values of others. We have a need to develop the students\u00b4 responsiveness to all kinds of social and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nAt Nykyrka school we work with planning and assessment, trying to increase the motivation of our students and making them aware of the goals of the curriculum. We need to learn more about how to challenge and motivate the students in order for them to achieve and exceed their potentials.\r\n\r\nThe partner school in England has a lot to offer us regarding these topics, and everything is just in line with our wish to establish a European dimension.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nNykyrka school is a small school, so the ?? participants cover most of the staff and the whole range of teachers, from preschool teachers to primary school teachers and also our headmistress. The participants of course include the two\u201cFirst Teachers\u201d, as they have an extra responsibility for school development.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nSessions of job shadowing at the British school, where the participants will be able to share experiences in the focus areas mentioned above.\r\nThe British school also plans to let some of their teachers do job-shadowing at Nykyrka school in Sweden at a later date.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project:\r\n\r\nThorough documentation of the job shadowing through the use of ICT. Reflections and evaluation together with the tutor of the partner school at the end of each job shadowing period.\r\nSeminars where participants will share their experiences will be held for our own staff, for other schools, for headmasters, local politicians, at the Library of Motala and also if possible for the top management group of the Municipality of Motala.\r\nOffer seminars at the Library of Link\u00f6ping, for teacher candidates at the University of Link\u00f6ping and for the Swedish Labour Union for teachers, sections Motala and Link\u00f6ping.\r\n\r\nAfter the mobility period:\r\nContacts via letters/mail/Skype with students in England. This will give our Swedish students a natural receiver for their English language skills, and increase their motivation and results.\r\nContinue to speak as much English as possible during lessons of all subjects.\r\nContinue working towards an international profile at our school.\r\nEvaluate these activities in spring 2019.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of the results and impact envisaged and potential longer term benefits:\r\n\r\nWe expect both short-term effects referring to individual development and long-term ones as improvement of the educational offer, continuous professional development of the whole staff, deepened knowledge of educational systems and enhanced opportunities for European cooperations. All this will lead to higher achievements for our students. We hope that this project will be a small-scale contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy and to national and local priorities.", "http://www.ststephens.surrey.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034231_1"], ["8ND", "Learning Together 2017", "The Orpheus Centre Trust", 62333.0, "This project has been developed on the basis of a strong existing partnership between the coordinating, sending and receiving organisations and following on from a number of successful EVS projects.\r\nThe project consists of two 11-month EVS activities involving a total of 8 participants, from 5 different countries and which will take place at two organisations in the UK, Treloar Trust and the Orpheus Centre. Treloar Trust and the Orpheus Centre both work to support young people with disabilities to fulfil their potential and to develop the skills needed to live as independent lives as possible.  The project includes partner organisations from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy and Slovakia. \r\nThe project provides opportunities for personal development for the participants through a positive non-formal learning experience.  There are well defined expected learning outcomes for the participants that are matched to their personal interests, motivations and needs. Through the participants\u2019 active role within the receiving organisations it is expected that this project will also be a positive learning experience for both the Orpheus Centre and Treloar Trust and in particular their students.  The organisations and their students are expected to benefit from the daily interaction, enthusiasm and motivation of the participants and in particular from the intercultural and European dimension that their presence will bring to the work of the organisations. This will be particular benefit to the students as they often have few opportunities to travel and experience other cultures.\r\nIt is expected that this project will also promote the positive aspects of cultural diversity within a team and at an organisational level as well as promoting the mutual benefits that can be attained through young people's active citizenship. In addition, it is expected that this project will support the work of the organisations in developing a greater awareness of disability; this will be reflected in the learning of the participants, the partner organisations and wider society.  \r\nThe project is expected to have a positive impact on the participants as through their active involvement they will gain tangible skills, knowledge and competences that will be of benefit to them in their future careers. The impact of the project will also be seen though the increased intercultural awareness of the students at the receiving organisations and also through the opportunity to share and develop best practice in the field of youth mobility between the organisations involved.", "http://www.orpheus.org.uk", "INTER-CULTURAL YOUTH EXCHANGE LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-036388_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RH9"}
