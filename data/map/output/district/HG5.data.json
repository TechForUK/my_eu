The \u2018Porpardet\u2019 project will address this through developing two innovative complementary portable automatic detection systems, based on novel concentrating and analysis methods for asbestos particles and certain other harmful materials of widespread concern, eg mineral quartz/silica. One system will be a wearable device with an immediate alarm, the second will provide rapid on-site quantitative analysis - both will have the ability to record exposure over time with a novel filter cassette. This equipment will directly improve the health protection of the individual, and reduce the potential cost of their healthcare provision and possible costs of litigation. It will be of great value to the manufacturing, construction, waste disposal sectors, and emergency services. It will allow application of relatively inexpensive resources in a rapid manner, but with proper risk management. The automation and simplicity foreseen will allow an ease of use and therefore an uptake in use which will not only lead to wider control, but will also allow moderate production costs for the equipment - which uses many elements now emerging from other industries such as low cost lasers.   The project will deliver two new products with related consumable sales. The products will be designed, manufactured, distributed and serviced by the SME partners within the project. It is estimated that the new products could generate a new market in excess of 12 million Euro per annum for the SME partners. The SME partners will be responsible for the manufacture, supply of the optics, filter system, detector system, image capture software and final assembly of the full system. A number of partners will use the test equipment to service a range of end users, most of which are also SMEs.", 5816.0, 1157866.0, "PORPARDET", null, null, null, "http://www.porpardet.signalgenerix.com/index.php", "http://www.gspkdesign.ltd.uk", null, "fp7_92173_998191887"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8AR", "la Mobilit\u00e9, une exp\u00e9rience pour tous", "SUE RYDER CARE", 851418.0, "The Regional Federation of the MFR in Aquitaine-Limousin in France is a non-profit organisation eyisting in the form of an association.\r\n\r\n25 MFR are members of the regional structure which encourages each one to adopt the goal of putting into place actions of European mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur strong points :\r\n\r\n- A strong experience in the organization of transnational and mobility projects (study visits, exchanges, Comenius and Leonardo)\r\n\r\n- Working in common between the different people who have the mission of putting into place the different European projects. The continuing education of these same people.\r\n\r\n- The ability to work in a team with the elected officials of our surroundings.\r\n\r\n- The desire to succeed and to be able to help the youth who participate in the mobility actions to use these experiences to their advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present document is the result of the long pratical working experience between 19 MFR and a partnership with another organization. This way of working together has permitted each member to build their individual project which included 877 young students.\r\n\r\n- 648 young students \u2013 2-4 weeks each\r\n\r\n- 52 apprentices for 3-4 weeks each\r\n\r\n- 139 Teachers and board members for periods ranging from 3 days to three weeks with the objective of discovering different professional situations.\r\n\r\n- 8 college level (post-baccalaurean) students for periods ranging from one to twelve months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group MFR spent 8 days together to put on paper their projects.\r\n\r\nEach MFR is independent and must have the approval of their board members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese experiences contribute to the professional and cultural adaptability of the participants and will be an advantage in their future work life.\r\n\r\nThe teaching teams learn more Europe today and the different economical situations. The Federation strongly encourages the teachers to experience an immersion in another culture to be able to better understand what the students go through : speaking a foreign language in a foreign country, using public transportation, eating different foods, staying within a budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FRMFR exists to guide and support its members. Its missions are the following :\r\n\r\n- Financial management \u2013 Follow-up of the different procedures \r\n\r\n- Coordination in relation with the project managers (two annual meetings).\r\n\r\n- Verification of each document sent to the 2E2F Agency.\r\n\r\n- Guidance in each project stage in relation with the technical committee and those who are responsible for the mobility projects (6-8 meetings each year).\r\n\r\n- Communication of information concerning the results of each action by the organisation of meetings and the edition of a newsletter \u201cL\u2019Europe Autrement\u201d and information given on the web. Also by organising work groups in relation with the CFA Aquitaine, Communaut\u00e9 de Commune du Rib\u00e9racois and the University of P\u00e9rigueux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected outcome at the end of the project :\r\n\r\n- The use of 100% of the financial grants.
