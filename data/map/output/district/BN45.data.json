It focuses on achieving many of our priority objectives: the fight against early school leaving and international openness. Indeed, ERASMUS+K1 mobilities must give our students at risk of dropping out of school, a new start to their education, a meaning to their learning process by achieving a training period abroad. Our priority objective is to help our potential school dropouts continue their studies. We want to improve achievement for all students thanks to European mobility, to help them JUMP forward, believe in themselves and in their capabilities so they can start building their own future with a diploma. No pupil shall leave school without qualifications. 'PRO JUMP EUROPE !' is designed for 36 male and female students, aged 16 to 19 in their second year BTEC National. A training period is compulsory in their curriculum.The mobilities will last four weeks. The trainees will go to England (Shellfish Farming / Garden Machinery Mechanics / Catering), Germany (Car Mechanics), Portugal (Catering) and to Italy, our new partner (Catering).We can observe that our mobility projects throughout Europe have had a very positive impact over the preceding 8 years. Indeed, the training periods carried out by O.GUICHARD vocational school students have undeniably given added value that can be measured at different levels:- our students have acquired strong cultural benefits, strengthened language skills, specific technical and professional knowledge related to the country, European citizenship-based autonomy development, a greater willingness to access higher education after the mobility, increased employability.- our vocational school has gained a broader permanent partnership with European companies which shows the quality of the work of the teachers involved in the project, having a great impact on our school's reputation and image.- our host companies have received new contributions on the French vocational training supplemented by the exchange of knowledge, they have shown their commitment and satisfaction for 8 years.Our school has been strongly involved in European and International partnerships for many years.  European projects act as a driving force that stimulates teachers' practices. The multi-departmental dimension of our school (under the supervision of 3 ministries : the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development) and its location in a tourist area encourage the commitment and involvement of our staff. England, Portugal, Germany, Norway, the Czech Republic, and more recently Bulgaria and Italy have provided us with stable partnerships on the previous Leonardo / ERASMUS + K1 and Comenius / ERASMUS + K2 programmes.Furthermore, the objectives for the students are to acquire new skills, such as:- professional skills: exchanging practices, implementing the acquired know-how, discovering new techniques, producing weekly reports about their activities sent by email - expected results: improved computer skills by validating their Information Technology and Internet Proficiency Certificate (B2i) if necessary, a validated training period in compliance with the training framework and curriculum, an enhanced EUROPASS CV and EUROPASS MOBILITY.- social and personal skills: taking the international dimension into account when looking for a job, giving meaning to their education, even improving school ambition by choosing to continue in higher education, developing new abilities such as adaptability, mobility, curiosity, autonomy, a desire to discover new lifestyles and working habits - expected results: an increased self-confidence, better communication skills, a better approach when solving problems and dealing with stressful situations.- language and cultural skills: developing language skills, visiting historical and geographical landmarks in England, Germany, Portugal and Italy -expected results: CEFR B1 level  reached (Common European Framework) in listening and interacting, oral presentation, validating the optional mobility unit and obtaining the EUROMOBIPRO certification on their diploma.Finally, our school aims at increasing partnership work with European companies and improving its image thanks to innovative actions and through the quality of its international openness. Expected results:  an increased number of European host companies, an increased recruitment in all sectors, lower dropout rates.", "http://www.riddleandfinns.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022586_2"], ["7EE", "FREE!

They will also take the optional mobility unit, which will be part of their exam.

Our action relies on a partnership consisting of a consortium of 8 organisations. All 8 Missions Locales having signed the partnership agreement possess a significant experience in transnational project management.

Some territories covered by the consortium members benefit from no European mobility action, rural territories being very often disconnected from those plans. This directly impacts their professional career  when searching for a job or qualification and also their chances for equal opportunities. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur operation would include 3 operational mobility activities:\r\n\r\nActivity 1 would be for publics with no mobility experience. It would consist of a 10 day immersion (excluding travel days) with a complete accompaniement by two counsellors during the whole stay.\r\nActivity 2 would be for young people with a previous mobility experience. It would consist of a 28 day immersion (excluding travel days) in complete autonomy.\r\nActivity 3 would be for employees from the consortium's Missions Locales.
