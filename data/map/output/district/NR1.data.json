By combining three most advanced microscopic techniques into a single workstation, we aim at reaching a new quality level in the study of the molecular biology of living cells. The proposed single molecule workstation will be composed of three key elements: (i) inverted light microscope (ILM); (ii) atomic force microscope (AFM); and (iii) optical tweezers (OT). A true virtue of this initiative is that by combining several ultra-sensitive microscopy techniques into a single workstation completely new horizons for molecular biology related studies are opened. The aim of this combined ILM-AFM-OT setup is to look at the surface topography using high-resolution AFM, to study the distribution of cellular molecules using high sensitive fluorescence and contrast enhanced light microscopy (ILM), and to measure molecular interaction forces with ultra-sensitive optical tweezers. As a complementary method, photo-thermal nano-spectroscopy (PTNS) will be used to investigate spectroscopic properties of cellular material with a spatial resolution down to sub-100 nm which will enable chemical analysis of sub-cellular components. The combined setup will provide a qualitatively new level in microscopic studies, giving unprecedented versatility in the detection and monitoring of cellular events with highest spatial and temporal resolution. The proposed single workstation will be used for the study of the correlation between structure and function of living cells with applications in immunology and cancer research.", 167715.0, 2688805.0, "SMW", "An imaging instrument beyond the state of the art", "Over recent years a number of imaging techniques have been developed that enable the visualisation and study of cells.

Chemical insecticides have been used to control insect pests for many decades and remain essential to ensure a supply of affordable food and as part of disease vector control for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, the world-wide use of synthetic insecticides over many years has led to increased resistance to insecticides and contributed to environmental contamination. One way to reduce insecticide use without compromising control is to use a synergist in combination with an insecticide. Synergists are themselves nontoxic but act by increasing the effectiveness of the insecticides they are used with. They do this by inhibiting the metabolic systems in insects that detoxify insecticides. The goal of this project is to develop ecofriendly synergists for use in formulations with insecticides, both in agriculture and in Public Health, enabling a reduction in the amount of insecticidal active applied, and thereby reducing the adverse effects of these insecticides on beneficial insects such as bees. On the basis of in-depth experimental analyses of the interactions of the known synergist piperonyl butoxide with metabolic enzymes in pest insects, new molecular structures will be designed, synthesized and evaluated on pest and beneficial species using laboratory bioassays and field trials. In addition, the synthesis process to manufacture these synergists will be evaluated with the aim of achieving an industrially and economically feasible process. Finally strategies will be developed that use the novel synergists to enhance the control of insect pests while preserving beneficial insects.

Based on the charter FVO hereby applies for grants to fund for the project \u201cPractice Europe 16\u201d (PE16), a continuation of earlier Practice Europe projects under the Erasmus+ Programme. The application is also based on the politically adopted strategy for internationalization in North and South Tr\u00f8ndelag as well as STFK's action plan for internationalization of upper secondary education. The two areas given priority in the overall strategy is internationalization of enterprises and youth.PE16 is a project that addresses both of these main areas and is specifically related to upper secondary vocational education. The project includes VET professionals, pupils and apprentices, but has its main focus on the last of these groups. FVO applies for 82 individual mobilities, of which 38 are apprentices and pupils. The remaining are VET professional, divided between accompanying persons and professional study visits/work experiences abroad. The mobilities will be distributed among different professions and geographical parts of the county. Weight will be put on interdisciplinary participation from different organizations, such as training establishments, vocational training offices, municipalities, schools and school owners.The activities that will be undertaken for apprentices and pupils are placements in European countries where the participants will work, observe and take part in daily life of enterprises or schools within their respective fields of expertise. For pupils the placements will be a part of their in-depth study project while they for apprentices will form an integral part of their apprenticeships. As a consequence, the period abroad will vary according to which group the participants belong. Pupils will be placed in periods of 2-4 weeks while the apprentices' stays normally will last for approximately 1-3 months.One of the objectives of PE16 is to meet the county's needs for international expertise. Enterprises of all sizes see the world as their market and depend on drawing inspiration, expertise, knowledge and workforce from across borders. Through their participation in the project, apprentices, pupils and VET professionals will be given the opportunity to enhance their knowledge, both in their fields of expertise, culturally and linguistically. A placement abroad gives first-hand knowledge on the country they are in, its culture and traditions. Living in another country contributes to the ability of meeting others with respect and understanding as well as the opportunity to reflect on your own experiences and circumstances at home. These are key values within international experiences, and are therefore transferable to new settings. These experiences will be valuable contributions to the individuals' life-long learning and useful expertise for enterprises, colleagues and fellow pupils.The mobilities will be organized in cooperation with FVO's partners in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Iceland and Slovenia. FVO has developed internal documents for the implementation and quality management of mobilities. The distribution of responsibilities between FVO and its partners are specified in a separate contract for each individual pupil and apprentice mobility. For some mobilities the partners abroad will be responsible for accommodation, language training and work placements in enterprises and schools, while FVO in other cases may organize all or most of the placements directly. Travel documents and insurances are always FVO's responsibility. An individual plan is always prepared for each pupil and apprentice placement. The plan specifies which competence aims are to be focused on during the period abroad. The chosen aims will take into consideration the apprentice's and pupil's local training curriculum and the need for skills development within their specific field of learning. Europass CV is used in the selection of participants and in the planning of the placement. Upon completion of the mobility, Europass Mobility Document is used to describe the expertise the participants have acquired during their internship.The participants are expected to enhance their international competence through their participation in PE16, and their individual learning outcome is to be a contribution to internationalization in schools and enterprises in South Tr\u00f8ndelag.

From 01.01.18 the counties were assembled to Tr\u00f8ndelag County municipality, which is now seeking the mobility project MMN with charter \u00abaccreditation reference\u00bb 2015-1-NO1-KA109-013311. Both of the former Counties  are chartered for the Erasmus + program  period 2014-2020 ( North-Tr\u00f8ndelag in 2009, 2015.  South-Tr\u00f8ndelag from 2015)\r\n\r\nThe application is based on a politically adopted strategy for internationalization in  North- and South-Tr\u00f8ndelag 2013-2016 and Tr\u00f8ndelag county municipality's financial plan 2018-2021. In addition, former North-and South-Tr\u00f8ndelag have own strategic documents that underline the work of internationalization in  secondary education and in mobility projects. In the economic plan for Tr\u00f8ndelag county municipality, it says that \"The county municipality will facilitate internationalization to be a tool in the learning work for both pupils and apprentices in upper secondary education.\" Further in the document, Fylkesplan for Tr\u00f8ndelag 2018-2030, Tr\u00f8ndelagsplanen, is referred to as the most important basis for discussing overall goals and strategies for Tr\u00f8ndelag. Internationalization is referred to as one of four main topics in this plan.\r\n\r\nThrough the project MMN, Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality wishes to achieve:\r\n- a strong regional approach of internationalization at training offices and World of Work through a strong focus on employee mobility in this project, engage more companies into mobility in order to  get international competence and knowledge of Erasmus + mobility.\r\n- together with actors from the county and tWorld of Work carry out mobility for students, apprentices, vocational teachers, instructors and other professionals associated with vocational education.\r\n\r\nWe wish to ensure that schools, training offices and World of Work  across the former countyes boaders  will increase their competence  about internationalization as a tool in professional training and development of industries.\r\n\r\nThe activity level in the MMN project is otherwise adapted to the new county and is based on charter applications from former North- and South-Tr\u00f8ndelag. The activities will ensure the planned development of international work in upper secondary education.\r\n\r\nTr\u00f8ndelag county municipality plans to carry  out 279 mobilities by the following activity types:\r\n- 97 long-term mobility for apprentices.\r\n-36 short-term mobility for students and apprentices.\r\n-166 employee mobility on shorter hospitalization stays.\r\n\r\nMobility will be conducted in cooperation with partners in Denmark, Germany, Ireland, UK, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Iceland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. For students, stays will last from 2-4 weeks, while the stays for the apprentices will in most cases last for about 3 months. For students, the placement will be linked to the subject of vocational education, while apprenticeship will be part of the apprenticeship. Employee mobility will vary from 4-6 days.\r\n\r\nOne of the objective of mobility in MMN is to fase for business needs for international competence. Through participation in the project, apprentices, students and professionals will be given the opportunity to increase their competence, both professionally, culturally, linguistically and personaly. These are key values within international competence that are transferable to other situations of life. These experiences will therefore be valuable contributions to the individual's lifelong learning process and useful competence also for fellow students, colleagues and workplaces in their home country.\r\n\r\nAnother objective of the project is to develop further the international work in vocational education and training in Tr\u00f8ndelag, in line with the rest of the planning work in the new county.\r\n\r\nA third objective of the project is to share knowledge about ECVET in the county: utilize several years of experience from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, which is a National ECVET Expert. The use of ECVET tools should give Erasmus Mobility recognition and transfer of learning between different learning environments and across borders and systems in Europe. Ecvet methodology and practical approach will contribute to placement, professional education and high-quality study stays. Through this, Tr\u00f8ndelag county municipality will achieve a strong regional approach in companies for international mobility as approved part of education in Norway with assessed and approved sub-education from abroad.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear expectation that the participants increase their international competence through MMN and that their individual learning outcomes will contribute to internationalization at learning arenas and in companies in Tr\u00f8ndelag. The project will be one of the contributions that Tr\u00f8ndelag County Municipality achieves its overall goals in internationalization of upper secondary education and  training and also of World of Work in Tr\u00f8ndelag.", "http://www.norfolk.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA116-038752_12"], ["2DH", "Alternative Curriculum Education out of the Wild", "Norfolk County Council", 97465.0, "At present, there is a gap in the education and support for school-based outdoor and environmental vocational learning for young people with challenging behaviour. The outdoors and other sustainable development contexts are often far more engaging for more vulnerable pupils than the traditional 14-19 curriculum. At the same time, young people who understand concepts around sustainable resource use, conservation and horticulture will be more informed and inspired to make their careers in these very same growth areas which are currently emerging. Young people must now remain in education until they are 18 \u2013 meaning that the outdoor learning context will be of huge importance, relevance and inspiration to these very same young people who are on average more likely to fall into the \u2018Not in Employment, Education or Training\u2019 (NEET) category upon leaving education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternative Curriculum Education Wild (ACE Wild) aims to train educators so that they can provide high quality environmental and outdoor learning education specifically for young people with challenging behaviour, which is of direct relevance to their future careers and further education opportunities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project, there will be a transferable school-based model which supports the professional development of teachers in this niche area, with the informed capacity to support other schools and organisations. This model will take educators from the beginning of the education journey in looking at how to identify the varying needs of these young people, right through to how educators can meet these needs through an \u2018Alternative Curriculum\u2019, specifically in partnership with local education and employment partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will achieve this aim through two key areas of work:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Action Research: Each of the 3 country partners involved will deliver 2 sets of 12 week sessions aimed specifically at vulnerable young people, using environmental and outdoor / sustainable resource use / green economy contexts. This research will be key to developing an informed model of practice that is well evaluated and based on experiences of the different partners, sharing the most innovative ideas, approaches, pedagogies and practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The development of training resources: These resources will comprise of a range of \u2018tried and tested\u2019 educational activities and approaches (including session plans and case-studies), using the environmental and outdoor learning contexts, which can be delivered by a variety of individuals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme will see the following 5 participating organisations meet together 4 times over the next 2 years, in each of their respective countries:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 Norfolk County Council, UK \u2013 The Environmental and Outdoor Learning Team, based at Holt Hall, has had extensive experience in supporting schools to become more sustainable and environmentally friendly, by providing teacher training, residential experiences for young people and leading European projects in the area of resource use and education.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Aylsham High School, UK \u2013 An \u2018outstanding\u2019 school who wishes to further develop their growing expertise around supporting vulnerable young people in the outdoors \r\n\r\n\u2022 Susted, UK \u2013 A small enterprise specialising in consultancy, support and training for education, with a focus on sustainable development who has worked with a range of schools, vocational colleges, universities and enterprises, in addition to being heavily involved in a large number of multinational projects.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Goldcrest Outdoor Education Ltd, UK \u2013 A small business specialising in providing best-practice outdoor and environmental education to Norfolk schools and communities, within their local environment. \r\n\r\n\u2022 RCE Rhine-Meuse, Netherlands \u2013 A Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development for the Netherlands and the Euregion; comprising of 4 universities, 10 muncipalities, 3 provinces and 20 primary and secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\u2022 RCE Oldenburger, Germany \u2013 A Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development for the district of Cloppenburg and Vechta in Germany, who addresses its activities to formal and non-formal educational organisations which focus on youth and young adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above, we hope to have better informed teachers in this growing area of education provision for vulnerable young people, specifically using the environmental and outdoor learning contexts.
