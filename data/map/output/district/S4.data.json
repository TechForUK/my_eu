PEMWE has showed capabilities in the emerging hydrogen scenarios to be a valid alternative to previously developed technologies, especially considering the dynamic and versatile operation expected of hydrogen production methods when integrated with RES.\n\nDespite the advances and improvements experienced to date with these systems, the technology needs to be further improved if it is to be installed as a competitive solution for energy markets and even more so in the case of off-grid configurations due to their particularities. The development of an autonomous off-grid electrolysers as an energy storage or backup solution (e.g. replacing diesel engines) is an unusual and challenging goal because it needs to have the capability of being directly coupled to RES in locations where the electricity grid is not deployed or weak.\n\nThe main goal of the ELY4OFF proposal is the development and demonstration of an autonomous off-grid electrolysis system linked to renewable energy sources, including the essential overarching communication and control system for optimising the overall efficiency when integrated in a real installation", 756617.0, 1996618.0, "ELY4OFF", null, null, null, null, "http://www.itm-power.com", null, "h2020_204287_974052370"], ["7QQ", "Building Innovative Green Hydrogen systems in an Isolated Territory: a pilot for Europe", "Itm Power (Trading) Limited", "BIG HIT will create a replicable hydrogen territory in Orkney (Scotland) by implementing a fully integrated model of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilisation for heat, power and mobility.

Other resilience methods including substitution processes and measures to tackle cascading effects will also be developed. The ERMG and resilience management methods will be tested and validated through stakeholder engagement, table-top exercises and three large-scale pilots (transport CI, electricity CI and water CI).
