Working with foreign people is increasing everywhere. Especially the entrepreneurs in the metal and electronics industry require that the students will aquire the skills needed for working abroad already during their education. In the restaurant business it is essential to have good language skills and to be able to understand foreign cultures. This will also help the students to be employed in their home region.\r\n\r\nThe length and content is tailored according to the student\u2019s individual needs.

In the real world tasks, which are tangible and challenging workplace scenarios, the school's representatives identify with representatives of the companies training links and synergies with the school curriculum, thereby creating the conditions for an effective validation of the training programme, measured in terms of knowledge acquired.\r\nTo this end, three of the key competences for citizenship proposed by the European Union are used as reference:\r\n\u2022 learning to learn: ability to organise one's own learning;\r\n\u2022 sense of initiative and entrepreneurship;\r\n\u2022 social and civic competences.\r\nIn short, training experience and guidance initiatives occupy an essential place within the school's education offer, underpinning a number of key aspects:\r\n\u2022 in relation to employability, analysis and management of performance in a pro-active and problem-solving approach, as part of a virtuous cycle with the skills acquired in the classroom;\r\n\u2022 as an opportunity for meta-reflection and self-assessment, highlighting overlaps between technical and professional knowledge and life skills linked to active citizenship;\r\n\u2022 in the personal pathway to actively seeking work.\r\nTo ensure that the school's guidance and work placement policies are sustainable, lasting and effective, we are applying for this project to grow the number of guidance teachers, the school's future career team, which, as part of a plan of work shadowing abroad, develops and refines the following professional competences, to be spent in the actions/steps/phases of guidance for school leavers:\r\n- analysis of the demand in terms of expectations and requests from students leaving the school;\r\n- definition of a skills assessment, using the tools made available by the AlmaDiploma programme and others which will be acquired as part of the experience of work shadowing abroad;\r\n- ensuring the transparency of the student's \"training record\" by building on experiences and skills acquired in non-formal, informal and formal contexts;\r\n- creating, to match demand and emerging skills, a personal career plan towards university or the workplace;\r\n- preparation, monitoring and final reporting of experiences from the work placements organised by the school in collaboration with the host companies; \r\n- career tracking for one or two years from finishing school;\r\n- longer-term: redefinition of the active pathways curriculum at the Martini school, using transferable skills profiles connected to the professional profiles of school leavers.\r\nThe bidders are the 15 teachers who are currently involved in the guidance activities, for both new admissions and leavers; they include various different key individuals in the school: staff, holding instrumental roles, responsible for activities relating to the development of the informal and non-formal student curriculum, vocational career plans, relationships with universities and with the world of work.\r\nThe teachers, using the active learning \"by doing\" methodology, will support colleagues who have proven experience in a European context and with this far-reaching and active approach they will instil the following in the school and the network of schools in the Rotaliana area, of which the Martini school is part: seminars, workshops, discussions and above all the spreading of best practice within the school, between colleagues who will be key to the growth of the project's results.", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036010_1"], ["2AJ", "Dual MOB - Dual Training through Mobility", "Bournville College of Further Education", 580938.0, "Two of the main problems faced by VET systems in Europe are Early School Leaving (ESL) and the number of students failing to achieve key competences at the end of compulsory education.\r\nVET system has played a main role in fighting these challenges over the years, however in order to continue to tackle early school leaving and equipping students with relevant skills required by the labour market, it is important to foster WBL practices.\r\nMoving from these challenges and considering that the Italian Ministry of Labour and Social Policy launched the Dual System in Italy, the members of the consortium have decided to increase the opportunities for learning mobility during VET pathways that use WBL methodologies.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to promote, within VET courses that adopt WBL methodologies,  learning mobility period abroad. Indeed, WBL and transnational mobility experiences are important to (re)motivate VET learners (preventing early school leaving) and to provide them with the competences required by the companies. \r\n\r\nTherefore the DUAL MOB project will give students the chance to develop technical competences and soft skills \r\nthrough WBL mobility experiences abroad. These experiences will be carried out during VET qualification path and with the final aim of assessing and validating the learning outcomes acquired during the mobility so as to facilitate future inclusion of the young participants in the labor market or to continue their studies.\r\nThe project will involve 300 students (1/3 suffering from economic/social/cultural disadvantage) enrolled in VET courses in one of the 150 VET Centres run by the Consortium Members in 18 Italian Regions. \r\n\r\nThe project has a wide sectorial and geographical coverage. The sectors in which the students will have the chance to take their internship are the following:\r\n- Agribusiness (Backery and Pastry; Agriculture)\r\n- Arts and Crafts (Fashion, Wood)\r\n- Mechanic and Construction (Mechanics, Masonry, Electric, Electronic, Thermo-hydraulic)\r\n- Graphics\r\n- Administrative, Selling\r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Personal Service (Beauty and Hairdressing)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the partnership will involve 16 partners from 6 different countries (ES, IE, UK, FR, DE, FI). Such a wide partnership will result in fruitful experience for the students, suitable to any professional path. \r\n\r\nThe DUAL MOB project promotes 2 different types of Transnational Mobility: 1) 3-4 weeks internships in a company abroad, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course; 2) 3-4 weeks in a VET centre abroad, with periods spent in company or other context, carried out by students attending an Initial VET course. \r\n\r\nThe Learning Outcomes will be valorized and recognized through the ECVET system. In fact, the Consortium Members will take advantage of the experience and the ECVET tools developed during the GORES project. \r\nThe project will have an impact on the development of professional and transversal skills of VET students and staff involved (accompanying persons), as well as on the offer of VET  training provision which will be possible thanks to the improvement in the use of the WBL approach and by strengthening the mutual trust among project partners.\r\n\r\nThis project will also lay the groundwork for enrichment in terms of organizational and teaching methods that the sending organisations may exploit during the pilot project related to the Dual System in Italy.", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005930_11"], ["2TS", "Grenzeloze ervaring!", "Ndevr Ltd", 259246.0, "BACKGROUND:\r\nIn spring 2017 the Gilde international policyframework is approved by the board. This policy framework is being implemented and is to a large extend operational. Concrete results and improvements are made compared to the previous years and these results are clearly visible. In 2017 is a central international information point is set up, the website GO Abroad! is made operational, a digital guideline is developed, an expertgroep and workinggroup (including all sectors) are operational and several workshops and promotional activities are carried out. This has led to a growing enthusiasm for international activities in the organisation. \r\n \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nInternationalisation fits in the overall policy of Gilde that everybody should be able to graduate as being \"internationally competent\".  Internships abroad are not the only way to realize this. It is also about integrating internationalisation in the study programs. For example via minors, language courses, guest speakers from abroad, excursions etc. (internationalisation @ home). For Gilde, it is an opportunity  to provide for students an added value on the labour market and to provide them more insight in other cultures and languages.\r\n\r\nFor the next coming year, Gilde Opleidingen has the objective to improve both the quality as the quantity of internships abroad. Both for students as for staff, at European level and at Euregional level. \r\nIn concrete terms, the following points of attention are defined:\r\n- strengthening the sectors in the proposal and collaboration;\r\n- further implementing internationalisation in the policy of Gilde;\r\n- attention for intercultural and language skills in the educational programs;\r\n- strengthening and optimizing the central information point of Gilde;\r\n- strengthening the communication and collaboration structure internally;\r\n- promoting internships abroad as an option for professionalisation for staff and teachers;\r\n- promoting working and learning across the borders with the Euregio (Germany, Belgium).  \r\n\r\nThe activities that are defined to realize the objectives are already put in place in 2017 and they will be continued in 2018.  Keywords are: SENSIBILISATION, COMMUNICATION  and SUPPORT. Collaboration will take place both at internal as external level. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS:\r\nIn the call 2018, the following numbers of students and staff are included:\r\nstudents short term: 96\r\nstudents ErasmusPro: 85\r\nteachers and staff: 39 \r\n\r\nThe total number of participants is increased significantly compared to the previous years. One of the reasons is a growing enthousiasm of students and staff, due to promotional activities, active collaboration and a workshop for staff. It seems that there is a growing motivation for mobility and an improved trust in the coordination, the organisation and the realisation of mobility activities. \r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT:\r\nBased on experiences of previous years, it is proven that an experience abroad is an added value for both students as for teachers and other staff. Not only in a professional way, but also in a personal way. By executing a part of the education in a context abroad, the complexity of the learning process increases considerably. This is something that we can never achieve within the safe environment of an educational institute. The students are better prepared for the labour market and are also less vulnerable on the labour market. For Gilde this is important towards the companies in the EUregio. Companies just across the border have a growing need for well trained and skilled people and Gilde can foresee in this need. \r\n\r\nThe experiences in this project will be evaluated (also via the particpant reports) and on the basis of the results of the students. This provides input for the preparation and the evaluation and for the improvement of the working processes. \r\n\r\nLONG TERM VISION:\r\nIn some of the VET programs it is almost a \"must\" to have international experiences. This is esepcially the case in the hospitality sector (tourism).\r\nHowever, as described earlier, an international experience offers more than only professional experiences. Therefore, an international experiences is relevant for everybody should be part of more VET programs at Gilde, so that everybody can leave the educational institute internationally competent. Eventually, the aim is to included internationalisation as a standard part of a large part of the VET programs at Gilde.", "http://www.ndevr.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038692_3"], ["2AJ", "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION", "Bournville College of Further Education", 319905.0, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION represents the ideal continuation and expansion of the previous edition of WORKSTAR project. The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented. The commitment continues:\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of language training and certification courses in various languages (participation in the MOVE 5.0 projects financed by the ESF Veneto Region);\r\n- in the promotion of CLIL methodology and job shadowing activities abroad (ETwinning)\r\n- in the upgrading and improvement of hosting services\r\n- in the implementation of tools for the management of all phases of mobility\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of cultural exchanges and stays abroad also through the consolidation of European networks", "http://www.bournville.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006482_36"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B31"}
