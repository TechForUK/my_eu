This competences are considered by many as lacking inside the youngsters that start looking for jobs for the first time, making not only their job search difficult, but also the possibility of improving their knowledge and consequently being less competitive in an economy that is increasingly globalised.\r\nWe intend to give young people an opportunity of growth in their professional formation in order to facilitate the acquisition and utilisation of knowledge, competences and qualification, to facilitate personal development and participation to the job market in a European dimension.

Thanks to the project, the participants will be able to integrate their school education and training, and in the company, to apply their knowledge and technical-operational abilities in order to transform them into competencies.Together with the professional results, the mobility will develop the meta-competence of <learning to learn>. The project, through the mobility, intends to provide the participants with outcomes in their ability of intercultural comprehension, flexibility, personal initiative, ability to relate to others in a foreign language.The development of these skills can be useful the participants to become a precious resource for the wellness and the growth (both in the Economy and in the image) of the territories in which they live, and encourage their employability.The internship abroad is recognized in the school education and training, since it is integrated in the compulsory school-work Alternance scheme.

Key Enabling Technologies such as advanced materials, nanotechnology, biotechnology are increasingly having a transformative effect on the sector. ICTs are having a highly significant impact on manufacturing processes with ICT enabled processes such as computer integrated manufacturing, \u201cdigital factories\u201d, etc. Companies require the adoption of new internationalisation strategies aimed not only at cost reduction but at quality improvement and more advanced techniques.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment. The partnership brings together partners from different countries (IT,DE,NL,IE,UK,FI,ES,FR,PT,GR) and is built ad hoc to include the necessary expertise to successfully reach the goals of the project.

Nevertheless, there are still many companies in the sector that do not export, mainly due to the small size and the lack of aggregation. Moreover, tha labor productivity rate is lower than the EU27 average.\r\nTherefore, there is the need for interventions to facilitate innovative processes in favor of productivity and competitiveness of agricultural and forestry enterprises, promoting production and market processes that can create greater added value.\r\nThe TastER project stems from a deep knowledge of the Emilia-Romagna territory and its needs, with an integrated approach aimed at the promotion, enhancement and protection of biodiversity, food and wine excellences and regional agri-food companies, with pragmatic references to operational tools that, through the European comparison will allow participants to acquire professional skills that are immediately usable in the labor market.\r\nIn order to fully represent the Emilia-Romagna agro-food supply chain, responding to the specific needs expressed by the various areas of specialization present in the regional territory, TastER intends to expand its area of intervention to all regional secondary schools and vocational training institutions within the agrofood sector, for a total of 23 sending partners, further enriching the Consortium with a high level partnership with FICO (Italian Farming Factory), the largest agri-food park in the world.\r\n\r\nAIMS\r\n- give a concrete answer to the needs that the Emilia-Romagna Region considers fundamental for the development and internationalization of the economy linked to the agro-food industry\r\n- compete with Europe by importing new elements to promote organizational and marketing innovations aimed at conquering new markets and promoting and protecting PDO and PGI products\r\n- respond to the needs of raising the quality of individual Consortium members and mobility, to facilitate the creation of a European labor market that is increasingly accessible and able to guarantee recognition of the skills and qualifications held\r\n- measure, recognize, validate LOs through recognizable and transparent procedures in line with ECVET indications through the adoption of a MoU\r\n-favor the creation of consortiums that strengthen the networks of EU companies, national intermediaries and companies with roles of welcome today, with a view to stimulating reciprocity on the one hand and any commercial relations on the other\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n1) 135 STUDENTS (IV classes) attending courses of \"Agrarian, agri-food and agro-industry\", \"Agriculture, rural development, enhancement of local products and management of forest and mountain resources\" and \"Food and wine and hotel hospitality\".

MI.FOR.MO. allow these 100 students to carry out 4 weeks of professional training abroad in various sectors such as mechanic,  electrotechnology, chemistry, construction, agrotechnology, business and administration, electronics, IT and tourism, technical assistance and maintenance. The objective of the project is to improve professional and personal skills, in order to make the beneficiaries become more competitive in the labour market, and develop a greater awareness about the significance of Europe and European citizenship. It aims to provide students with an opportunity for growth in their training and continuing education in the dimension of facilitating the acquisition and use of knowledge, skills and qualifications to facilitate personal development and participation in the labour market in a European aspect. The innovation introduced by the Ministry of Education, which extends the practice ASL to the entire higher education, makes this project even more significant because it will offer to students an important and qualified path. An internship abroad will help them to make the right choice of training courses for both continuing education and for vocational training. The objectives of the project acquire a greater importance in this time of difficult economic conditions, which particularly affect the productive activities. Therefore, today the need to broaden the horizon of personal experiences of those involved in education, in order to provide operational tools and capabilities to assess how to respond effectively to new market challenges, is stronger than ever. The selected host companies have years of experience in the field of mobility and can therefore guarantee organizing a good quality project in all its aspects (linguistic, professional and human). This long long collaboration between the Institutes of the Consortium and the host partners has allowed to share the project's objectives in order to identify the best companies for students respecting their skills and abilities. The participating countries are: Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Malta. The departures are scheduled in June-July 2018 and the structure of the project involves a long period of preparation in Italy and 4 weeks of training abroad. The project will supported by 8 teachers from the Consortium that will be authorized to prepare, accompany and monitor participants. As it is the first overseas experience for the students, and to better assess the actions planned, it was considered important to include in the project, some accompanying teachers who can facilitate the process of initial adaptation and monitor the activity; during the work placement  teachers will carry out some monitoring and evaluation actions. The above objectives can be achieved thanks to the MOBILITY CARD obtained by the Consortium, which will allow to implement the internationalization strategies, for the period 2016-2019, to innovate the training structures, in order to evolve the curriculum of the institute, through the dissemination of good practices and teaching / learning units also set up with European partners. For that reason, the roles and duties of the various figures and partners participating in the project have been better defined, so that over the three years there is a 30% increase in annual flows of both students and staff. In addition, the Consortium Institutes have adopted an internationalization plan that also provides training for staff in order to expand and improve the training offer. To achieve this goal, 2 internship teachers are expected to be sent for 2 weeks to study the skills certification methodology in the British School system.
