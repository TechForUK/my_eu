We want our teachers to feel more comfortable in delivering stimulating and engaging Spanish lessons develop an understanding of the Spanish culture. \r\n\r\nAs our school is in the top 10% deprived areas of the country it is unlikely that our children will have the experience of visiting Spain (or rather European countries) until later adulthood. In addition to this, nearly all of our children have English as an Additional Language; therefore giving children different cultural experiences is a key aim at St Thomas. Our children would profit from having regular contact with the partnership school and it would improve our cross curricular links within literacy. A key aim at our school is to promote Speaking and Listening and we need to find ways to increase our cross curricular teaching and learning. \r\nWe are developing a new Spanish curriculum so would appreciate the opportunity for learning and discussion related to the important issues of developing language within a primary school. We need to decide on our priorities for MFL so would like to increase our knowledge of all aspects of developing this subject.\r\nIn order to develop Spanish teaching across our school and achieve above aims, we plan to establish a two-year project which will involve the whole of our school. It will include four teachers (one teacher from each year in Key stage 2) taking part in a training course in Spain.\r\n\r\nAs a Modern Foreign Language is compulsory from September 2014 this experience would put St Thomas in a great position to deliver interesting, exciting and inspiring lessons. As a KS2 member of staff would be going from each year group it will allow teachers to build on consistencies and teaching practice \u2013 knowing exactly where to progress individuals year on year. The four teachers involved would be able to work closely together as a team to ensure that progression takes place right across Key stage 2.\r\nThis will lead to improvement of the teaching and learning of Spanish, more meaningful contexts, links with other subjects and integration into daily routines.\r\n\r\nThere will be more enjoyment in the learning of Spanish. This will come about through better teaching ideas and methods, better resources, more stimulating cultural activities, and through having the opportunity to communicate regularly with children of their own age. Our children will have new opportunities to discover different cultures,  increasing future aspirations.\r\nWe hope to increase the intercultural understanding within our community as a whole. We want to involve parents as much as possible \r\n\r\nWe hope to impact on the self-esteem of our children through giving them the opportunity to learn languages and transferred the language skills that many of them already have (through being bilingual). This whole project, and the links we will make with the Spanish school, will all contribute towards our aim to achieve the International School Gold Award.", "http://www.stthomaswernethprimary.co.uk", "St Thomas Werneth Church of England Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002214_coordinator"], ["1SE", "Quality First MFL", "St Thomas Werneth Church of England Primary School", 21500.0, "St. Thomas' School is a larger than average-size primary school, and almost all pupils are from minority ethnic groups. The large majority of pupils speak English as an additional language. As our school is in the top 10% most deprived areas of the country, it is vital that our children receive quality teaching in all aspects of the curriculum. Sadly this is not the current case in MFL. Languages can be an excellent way to enhance children\u2019s life chances and future career options, so we need to ensure that all of our pupils are given the best possible language learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nStaffing changes mean that we currently have little Spanish expertise but much enthusiasm, and provision across our school is inconsistent. \r\n\r\nOur MFL coordinator uses lots of Spanish in his class and has seen the positive effect this has had on pupils confidence, speaking and listening skills, and enjoyment and we need to spread this type of teaching across the whole school.\r\n\r\nWe need to increase the skills of our staff to enable them to confidently teach Spanish in their own classes. We need to take a whole school approach to ensure that we create a sustainable approach to Spanish in our school.\r\n\r\nTaking an honest look as a whole staff at our current provision, we feel that the best approach for our school is a much larger scale, whole school project giving all of our new staff the opportunity to develop their skills and professional profile, ensuring a major impact.\r\n\r\nStaff interested in attending such a valuable learning opportunity have between 1 and 20 years of teaching experience. Some members of staff have a little Spanish language knowledge, some up to around GCSE level, however the majority have little to no additional language knowledge.\r\n\r\nHaving our staff learn different, exciting ways to deliver MFL and how to further embed it around school and across the curriculum will be hugely beneficial for our children who get little access to other cultures and are unlikely to visit Spain until they are young adults. \r\n\r\nA large-scale, whole school approach will be the key to developing a successful project with a significant long-term impact on staff and pupils. Involving a large group will enable us to launch an exciting and confident scheme through school, allow for further collaborative support and planning, and enable us to apply Spanish throughout the school environment and curriculum. For this reason, we are planning a two-year Erasmus+ project involving 20 mobilities.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, we will be able to develop competent and confident teaching of MFL that is lively and enjoyable, with opportunities for extra-curricular and cross-curricular learning of Spanish. We will teach the linguistic element and, with our Spanish school links, be able to compare and contrast traditions and cultures that our children would not be able to access. We would learn from each other and potentially even develop exchange programs.\r\n\r\nOur current staff have the commitment and enthusiasm to make a success of this project. We just need to give them the opportunity to develop the necessary skills.", "http://www.stthomaswernethprimary.co.uk", "St Thomas Werneth Church of England Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047038_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "OL8"}
