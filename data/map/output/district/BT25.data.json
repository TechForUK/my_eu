Associazione Eufemia chose to support them with the experience in writing European projects and involving some partners of local and international networks.\r\nDescription of the project: Urban Sustainability aims to be an opportunity to confront peers from different countries on lifestyles and on the influence of the social context in which you are.\r\nSport and physical activity, nutrition and the approach to cultural integration change according to the geographical area in which they live. This is why it is important to confront each other and find mutual incentives to inspire good practices and virtuous behavior.\r\nThe reflection becomes an opportunity to discover something more about their potential and the ability to take care of themselves, but at the same time also of others and the environment in which they live. Urban spaces become the scenario in which to experiment, increase and improve their soft skills.\r\nAims:\r\n- promoting youth mobility and cultural integration\r\n- enhance the resources of the urban periphery and the skills of those who live it\r\n- promoting a healthy lifestyle, sporting activity and sustainable nutrition\r\n- promote the values \u200b\u200bof the Erasmus + program\r\nParticipants:\r\n5 participants aged between 16 and 20 for the 6 participating countries + 1 adult Group Leader (2 for Italy).\r\nAt least 50% of the participants come from social contexts with fewer opportunities (social, economic, geographical, NEET or drop out risk, unemployed) and gender equality is guaranteed.\r\nPlace:\r\nTurin, Italy. Fourth most populous city in Italy, former capital of the automobile industry, in recent years has faced major transformations in the urban and social fabric. The activities will take place in Turin and surroundings, in public or private spaces that can provide adequate support and equipment.\r\nDates: YE - From 10 to 19 July. The exchange will last 10 days, one of which is considered a travel day.\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe project will combine various methodologies and tools: techniques that refer to non-formal education, role and team games, sports activities and creative workshops, linguistic animation and moments of individual and group reflection.\r\nParticipating countries: Italy, Bulgaria, UK, Hungary, Macedonia, Portugal.", "http://www.journeyfree.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT03-KA105-013167_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT25"}
