However, faster growth has been seen in the revision market, where prosthetic joints are replaced, than in primary interventions. The major cause of these revisions is that all joint replacements are prone to wear leading to loss of implant function. Further, it has been demonstrated that adverse or extreme loading has a detrimental effect on implant performance. Thus, device failure still occurs too frequently leading to the conclusion that their longevity and reliability must be improved. The premise of this proposal is to realise that wear and corrosion are an inevitable consequence of all implant interfaces within contemporary total joint replacements. To overcome this problem our novel approach is to use silicon nitride coatings in which the combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released, reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions. In this work a variety of silicon nitride based coatings will be applied to different tribological scenarios related to total hip arthroplasty. The coatings\u2019 suitability in each scenario will be assessed against target profiles. In particular, it is important to consider coating performance within each of these applications under adverse conditions as well as those outlined in internationally utilised standards. To accomplish this, cutting-edge adverse simulation techniques, in vitro assays and animal models will be developed together with a suite of computational assessments to significantly enhance device testing in terms of predicting clinical performance. Data will inform new standards development and enhance current testing scenarios, and will provide 5 European enterprises with a significant market advantage, whilst providing data for a regulatory submission which is aligned with Dir 93/42/EEC.", 1014264.0, 14907410.0, "LifeLongJoints", "Artificial lifelong joints can become a reality", "Joint replacement procedures constitute a medical market calculated in billions per year, increasing with the ageing population. As joint replacements are prone to wear, leading to loss of implant function, it is important to extend their lifetime to avoid repeated surgeries.", "Previous attempts to increase the functional lifetime of hip and knee artificial joints focused on using wear-resistant materials. The project \u2018LifeLongJoints: Silicon nitride coatings for improved implant function' (http://www.lifelongjoints.eu (LIFELONGJOINTS)) explores a different concept. It aims to develop a harder wearing coating that also produces soluble debris with decreased impact on surrounding biological tissues. New silicon nitride low-wear coating for articulating surfaces and interfaces will result in implants with improved wear characteristics.\n\nLIFELONGJOINTS hopes to achieve longer-lasting and more robust implants and reductions in implant failures. The 5-year effort, to be completed in 2018, involves a consortium of 15 centres of excellence within the European research and technology community.\n\nIn addition to design and characterisation of a novel wear-resistant silicon nitride-based coating for articulating and non-articulating bearing surfaces, the project has several other objectives. These include development of advanced methodologies for simulating activities of daily living using mechanical and software systems, which predict wear and allow the pre-clinical testing of a series of prototype devices. These newly developed tests will challenge the coating beyond the current standards and will include activities such stair climbing and stumbling. Laboratory studies will also address the effects of silicon nitride on living cell to ascertain whether there are any toxic effects. It is expected that silicon nitride coating will also reduce corrosion, decreasing adverse biological responses.\n\nDuring the first year, LIFELONGJOINTS partners identified deposition process parameters with regards to silicon nitride coating properties. Silicon nitride-coated cobalt chromium samples were then tested. Testing included adhesion, roughness, hardness, wear resistance and tribocorrosion. The scientists investigated the reasons leading to failure of implants, specifically the fretting wear around the taper junction of the hip implants. State-of-the art simulators are currently being developed that mimic the 'real-life' cycles that cause adverse loading and motions.\n\nThe project has had a promising start. The new coatings should lead to improved therapeutic outcomes of joint replacement procedures and increased patient benefits.", null, "http://www.prosim.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/155638.jpg", "fp7_106919_959882319"], ["4JZ", "Assistive Technology Rapid Integration & Construction Set", "Sensory Software Ltd", "More than 2,6 million people in Europe have problems with their upper limbs and therefore many of them depend on Assistive Technologies (AT).

They will need to improve their Spanish language competence, the cultural knowledge and understanding, and will also need to develop an understanding of language teaching methodology and have ideas to use in class. \r\nAs a school we would like to make links to a school in Spain as a result of this project. We would like to build a sustainable link that would be of benefit to the children in both countries. We would like to increase cross curricular links and bringing an intercultural understanding element to other subject areas and develop the connection between literacy and language learning. We would like to look for ideas and resources that will help us to improve our children\u2019s literacy through teaching them Spanish. \r\n\r\nWe would like to develop capacity within school so that we have a group of teachers back and offer support to all the rest of the staff in order to develop a whole school approach to the teaching and learning of languages. We also want to further extend our community links and increase parental involvement in school life and address the issue of transition into Key stage 3. \r\n\r\nWe plan to develop a two-year project in our school which will lead to is achieving all the above aims. The project will involve five mobility activities to Spain. The MFL coordinator will take part in a series of two courses.\r\n\r\nTaking part in these courses will mean that our MFL coordinator will have an excellent understanding of the best way to embed Spanish into our curriculum and all participants will be much more confident in their Spanish language skills and cultural knowledge and will have a good bank of ideas and resources.

In this way, our provision will become more sustainable, and it will greatly improve our pupils\u2019 learning experience. Languages will become embedded into our curriculum and into our daily routines. Languages will be visible everywhere in Tithe Barn. Children will see that we value language learning and other cultures, and they will understand the relevance and importance of languages to their own lives.\r\n\r\nWe are also very excited about developing a book project as a way to link literacy and language learning, encouraging our children to read French storybooks independently for their own enjoyment. \r\n\r\nWe intend to improve our teaching and learning by introducing new and innovative teaching methods and developing a link with a French school. We will improve our resources and learning environment and make improvements in planning, assessment, transition, cross curricular links.\r\n\r\nWe believe that taking a whole school approach in this way is the most effective way to establish an outstanding model of language teaching in our school. All of these improvements will mean that our school becomes established within our local authority as the hub of support and an example of good practice. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we need to build knowledge and capacity for high quality language teaching within our staff, developing and strengthening the role of teaching assistants. In light of the fact that primary school teachers are now required to teach languages, it is essential that our staff are given the opportunity to develop these skills in order to support their professional development and future career options.\r\n\r\nWe want to approach our teaching of French in a meaningful way, with first hand experiences that will bring language learning to life. We envisage developing strong links between language learning and literacy, with a particular focus on using books and storytelling, leading to an annual story sharing festival. \r\n\r\nOur school is known for its excellent teaching. Therefore, we want our provision of French to also be of this standard so that we are in a position to be able to offer advice and support to others. We need to ensure that we have systems in place such as effective assessment for languages, a high quality learning environment that uses authentic materials and supports pupils\u2019 learning, and clear progression.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we need to focus on establishing a detailed transition programme with our local high school, ensuring the progress made in primary school is recognised and built upon in secondary. \r\n\r\nWe will develop an innovative project in our school over two years involving 17 immersion courses in France, focusing on language improvement, developing cultural knowledge, language teaching methodology and creating links with a French school. \r\n\r\nAs a result of taking part in these courses, all staff will greatly improve their French language ability.
