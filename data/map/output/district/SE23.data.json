The school has a wide range of languages, cultures & ethnicities. Most pupils are Roman Catholic. There is a strong and close connection with the Italian community and the school works in partnership with the Italian Consulate and adopted Italian as its focus language for the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages.\r\n\r\nItalian is taught from Y 1 to Yr 6 with the help of an Italian teacher. Class teachers, however,  lack confidence to use the language beyond the Italian lesson, and this has been identified as an area for development in the SDPlan. The school will arrange for staff to take part in an Italian Language Course, with Cactus Languages, which will develop skills, confidence of  and expertise of teachers so that they are able to use Italian across the curriculum. \r\nYear 1             6 Teachers      3 Teaching Assistants     1 Assistant HT            Headteacher                \r\nYear 2             6 Teachers      3 Teaching Assistants     1 Assistant HT            Headteacher           Total staff in Yr 1 & Yr 2 = 22 Teaching Staff\r\n\r\nWithin the planned activities, the HT & Asst HTs will take part in the learning programme in Yr 1 and Yr 2 to ensure that momentum, and commitment to the project back in the UK, evidenced in external reviews. Staff will enrol on an Italian Language course in order to develop the confidence to use Italian in their lessons and participate more fully in the lessons in school with the teacher from the Italian Consulate, on their return to school. Teachers and Teaching Assistants will lead CPD sessions each half term so that their learning and experiences are disseminated amongst all staff within the school community.  Teachers will  integrate Italian speaking into other curriculum subjects, as well as build stronger links with the local Italian community, our parents & their families. Increased  teacher confidence will create opportunities for spontaneous talk in the classroom in Italian. Teachers and pupils will participate in more authentic exchanges, eg. meeting and greeting phrases. Teachers will conduct classroom business using simple expressions in Italian. Pupils will begin to use Italian for real communicative ends and build their speaking confidence in the process. As the SDPlan identifies that this project would span a 2 year period, the impact will be evident as Italian becomes further embedded in the school curriculum, and the commitment to developing the expertise of staff and children in learning Modern Foreign Languages.\r\n\r\nCelebrating the diversity and richness of our families cultural heritage reflects the ethos of our school. Teachers and pupils will provide showcase lessons for parents and staff from other schools (one each term, inviting 12 teachers from each school ie. 24 teachers). \r\n\r\nIn addition, another key area identified on the SDPlan is the development of independence in learning and development of a Mastery approach, which will be reflected in teaching and learning across the curriculum. The school has previously had a lead teacher/Assistant HT who has made an exchange  visit to Shanghai, to learn about Maths Mastery. This has had a positive impact on our school and the delivery of the curriculum. We have benefited from the cultural exchange and know that we have much to learn from our colleagues in Europe too.

This would include:  HT Report to Governors, Newsletter to parents, Website, local press.

The staff will share their learning & the impact in school with parents with workshops and presentations. The leaders and teachers involved in learning from Reggio Emilia, will disseminate this learning, with 6 workshops each year for staff and teachers in Lewisham. We expect to reach 120 teachers. The impact of the project will be evaluated using baseline questionnaires, lesson observation records and pupil conferences. These will be repeated at the mid point and end of the project and reported to governors and the Erasmus+ project. Through this project, Italian language learning will be integrated into the school curriculum by 2020, and pupils' independence in learning will be evidenced in KS2 scores and external reviews eg.

In our experience, they are innovation labs, incubators of new ways of working, living and acting for the co-creation of sustainable communities.

Concrete results of the project are the intellectual outputs: Applied research and Online Educational Toolbox - 'hands on' tool based on tried and tested methods and experience that can be used by the public who want to create similar clusters or improve work of present one. For the creation of both intellectual outputs, we will use a collaborative framework for the gathering of information and as a continuous process we will include peer to peer learning. For the creation of our applied research we will combine both academics and creative professionals to work together in an international team, this will create the base for a different more innovative dynamic within the research team. During the creation of the toolbox we will use learner generated approach to its content with internal testing (alpha testing) by a small team of individuals from the partnership to measure and test the content (build, measure, learn or build measure, change) and external testing (beta testing) with new learners from outside of the clusters. The toolbox will utilise as many new digital methods and open source resources as possible.
