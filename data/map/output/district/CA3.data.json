Supporting economic and life cycle assessment of the resulting gains in energy efficiency and conversion of renewable carbon, together with an implementation strategy based on a product mix with optimal value, will inform step changes that contribute to achieving more secure and sustainable sludge treatment and management practices in Europe while reducing pressure on natural resources and reliance on manufactured fertilisers.  Addressing key sludge management issues in the context of EU climate change mitigation and energy policies, the project concentrates on novel processes for sludge volume reduction, more efficient treatment and downstream processing for high quality sludge derivatives together with application protocols and assessment of the pathogen risk and long term soil impact for greater public confidence. Using an integrated approach with emphasis on the whole wastewater treatment system, the project promises innovative system solutions that have the potential to achieve up 20% annual carbon savings for the water industry by 2020 and ultimately could deliver up to 15,791,131 tCO2e pa savings for Europe.

The main task of this project is the social integration of adults, especially refugees and migrants, into the mainstream society through holistic education approaches, which we will research and also determine their potential for transfer into new local contexts. Throughout Europe different methods and strategies for facing the refugee crisis have been developed and through this project we plan to detect the best strategies in the field of adult education aimed at refugees. In the project we will train educators, who already posses the basic skill sets, on the best principles of effective and active work in the field of educating adult refugees and members of other vulnerable groups and helping in their integration into the mainstream society and the work market. With this in mind we formed a partner consortium, which includes organisations that are actively engaged with educating refugees and other vulnerable groups. The partners have also formed strong professional networks on the local, regional, national level, through which they will pull many experts to contribute to the implementation of EDSI.\r\nEDSI\u2019s 5  training activities for educators will include 95 experts working in the fields of adult education and refugee integration coming from Slovenia, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, the Czech Republic, Spain and Great Britain. These training activities will be based on informal learning methods, flexible modules, use of ICT, a lot of field work and visits to relevant stakeholders. This training program will be supplemented with a large number of dissemination events: 8 exhibitions, 3 concerts, 8 round tables, 6 press conferences and 2 workshops. The dissemination events will reach a wide array of target groups ranging from refugees, through the general public to experts and decision-makers. \r\nGoals of EDSI:\r\n- to increase the capacities of organisations working in the field of adult education focusing on refugees\r\n- to increase the competences, knowledge, language and soft skills of educators, who work with adult refugees and through this to make a positive contribution to education and integration results\r\n- to collect and research examples of good and innovative practices and methods and to study the possibilities of they transfer to new local environments; to synthesise this into a toolkit and disseminate it to relevant stakeholders on the local, national and European level\r\n- to establish a long-term network of organisations working in the field of adult education and refugees and to guarantee high quality future projects building on the legacy of EDSI\r\n- to facilitate interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral cooperation\r\n- to foster inter-cultural dialogue, understanding and acceptance of diversity and to fight discrimination and radicalisation in all spheres of society \r\nWe expect the project to result in increased capacities of partner organisations and also other organisations in contact with the project. Through the project we will develop the European dimension of their work and give them access to good practices already implemented in their fields of work. We will also establish guidelines of transferring these practices to new local contexts. Thus we will directly address the challenges they face and give them potential solutions for them. This effect will not only be limited to partner organisation but will be disseminated to other relevant stakeholders, who will act as multipliers. The main tangible result of the project will be the development of a toolkit presenting good practices and ways to implement them.
