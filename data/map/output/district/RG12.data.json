The plant capacity is 10,000 t/y of fuel, of which 5,000 t/y fully synthetic paraffinic jet fuel, the rest is diesel and aviation gasoline.\n\nThe plant is based on technology that has been developed by Swedish Biofuels and LanzaTech, which. has been validated by the United States Air Force (USAF) and the United States Federal Aviation Authority (FAA). The technology has been granted patent protection in Europe the USA and the other major markets of the world. The plant, in the main, uses standard equipment. The non-standard equipment, roughly 10 % of the total, is to be manufactured by AS Remeksi Keskus.\n\nThe plant is to be constructed in Sweden on a site owned by Perstorp Bioproducts AB, the wood raw materials to be supplied by SCA Energy AB. The fuel will be used by Deutsche Lufthansa AG for flight tests. When the fuel is available it will used by Saab as part of a Sweden national study involving the Swedish jet fighter Gripen.\n\nAll products from the plant, jet fuel, diesel and aviation gasoline will be marketed by SkyEnergy BV.\n\nThe raw material base for the demonstration plant will be extended during the project by 1) the introduction of ethanol produced from municipal solid waste by Abengoa Bioenergia Nuevas Tecnologias SA 2) the use of biogas for the production of syngas by Perstorp.

Thus, whilst the pathogenesis of its notorious pathogens (C. botulinum, C. perfringens and C. difficile) is ascribed to the devastating toxins produced (neurotoxins, endotoxins and cytotoxins), it is their capacity to produce spores that lies at the heart of the diseases they cause. This is because spores play the pivotal role in the spread of infection (eg, C. difficile) and in foodstuff contamination and food poisoning (eg, C. botulinum and C. perfringens). The processes of spore formation (sporulation) and germination (return of the dormant spore to toxin-producing, vegetative cells), therefore, represent key intervention points. On the other hand, the majority of clostridia are entirely benign and can sustainably produce all manner of useful chemicals and fuels. Crucially, the regulation of chemical production is intimately linked to that of sporulation. Spores of benign species may also be used as a delivery system for treating cancer. Yet, despite the spore\u2019s importance, little is known of the developmental processes of sporulation and germination.
