Apart from the nuisance Tabanid fly presence lead to serious economic consequences. The blood loss of farm animals can reach up to 200-300 cm3 per day, which results in weakening and occasional death in livestock. Through interfering with animal\u2019s natural grazing behaviour it also causes reduced productivity inasmuch as the milk yield and meat production decrease. Tabanid flies transmit over 35 diseases to livestock and even people, including flafellate trypanosoma that promotes health threatening conditions such as equine infectious anaemia (EIA), as well as other trypanosomes affecting cattle and sheep.  Protecting outside fed livestock, particularly in eco-farms that comply with bio standards is proved to be difficult, as at present there are no effective protective systems or biological methods available for controlling tabanids. Providing protection against blood-feeding horse-flies also pose a problem around outdoor swimming facilities or recreational resorts and camp sites located in close proximity of water resources.  The TabaNOid system will develop a passive fly trap using highly and horizontally polarized light that can be adjusted to meet the needs of territories of various sizes. The proposed system will meet all requirements of eco-farms and organic farmers as no polluting toxins or insecticides will be used. Investigation of tabanid behaviour and flying routes will help to develop passive traps that attract only a negligible number of other beneficial flying insects, eliminating almost exclusively tabanids, without having any serious effect on the area\u2019s ecosystem, since there are very few natural enemies of tabanids.

A modular system, allowing a reduction of the footprint, will be developed with two robots and one active bio-mimetic probe, able to cooperate among themselves in a biomimetic sensory-motor integrated framework. A gross positioning 3-axes robot will support a miniature parallel robot holding the probe to be introduced through a 'keyhole' opening into the skull of the patient. Optical trackers (tracking the end effector and the patient), an imaging endoscope camera, and electromagnetic position and force sensors (on the probe) will extend robot perception by providing the control system with position and force feedback from the operating tools, and with visual information of the surgical field. Path planning outside and inside the body will be autonomously proposed by the control system by processing of preoperative diagnostic information. The path inside the brain will be planned on the basis of a 'risk atlas' reproducing a fuzzy representation of a brain atlas, relating structures to a 'level of danger'. Construction of the atlas will rely on cognitive learning, where the system will be able to provide the surgeon with explanations for any suggested action. Semi-autonomous plan updating, following unforeseen changes occurring during surgery and based on processing of information gathered intra-operatively (e.g. ultrasonic images), will be negotiated between the system and the surgeon, where the latter will be allowed to specify any additional constraints to the planner. Ex- ante- and final path plan inside and outside the body will thus stem from the interaction between the surgeon and the intelligent core of the system.

The consortium consists of 3 SME-AGs who represent the forest operators that will benefit from the technology, and provide direct routes to market for the materials produced.

However, the European meat processing industry is extremely fragmented and characterised by businesses of very small size. Small and medium enterprises play an important role in the food sector, both in economical and social terms. The traditional and farm workshops are often based in rural area where the density of inhabitants is low and, for this reason, the diversification of the production has direct implications for employment and the maintenance of these traditional enterprises has a great economic impact.\nThe sensory characteristics of food products are essential for consumers and the challenge for consortium SME sausage producers lies in increasing production while minimizing product variability, maintaining flavour and desired texture and assuring product safety. Fermentation and maturation play a pivotal role in the final sausages quality. Maturation requires the precise control of two critical parameters \u2013 relative humidity and temperature \u2013 that are crucial for the product\u2019s final sensory characteristics and safety. The main objective of this project is to design and develop: (i) an analytical system that could be incorporated in ripening/drying chambers to provide information on the evolution of the relative water content and distribution in representative sausage samples along the chamber, as well as a local indication of the temperature and relative humidity values near those samples. (ii) A drying chamber control system which uses the information from the multi-sensor system to readapt the environmental conditions in the chamber for a correct drying process.\nThe proposed DryCheck project will give SMEs a practical tool with which improve the production of quality sausage with a user-friendly albeit advanced technology product at an affordable cost.", 184239.0, 1238521.0, "DRYCHECK", "Meat drying meets technology", "The craft of salting, smoking and curing comes of age with the integration of technology. A newly developed system improves flavour and reduces spoilage.", "Funded by the EU, the project 'Electrical impedance-based system to monitor drying process in sausages' (http://www.drycheck.eu (DRYCHECK)) designed this user-friendly system to measure and report chamber information. Chambers are used to ripen and dry the meats. The control system uses sensors placed within the chambers to calculate and give adjustments for the chamber environment.\n\nUnder enormous pressure from decreasing exports and the economic crisis, activities in the EUR\u00a0267 million market for dried meats can no longer only be done on a manual basis. The industry wanted to reduce spoilage and increase quality with improved, precise indicators of sausage maturity. This newly created electrical impedance-based system to monitor the drying process in sausages fills this need.\n\nResearch steps included written documentation of best practices for the drying process. The multi-electrode system for measuring meat data like weight, density, temperature and relative humidity was designed and developed. The system requires little power at a low speed.\n\nData analysis and sensitivity distribution were taken into account during the final algorithm implementation, and during the building of the prototype researchers finalised physical and mechanical construction items. The sausage drying and maturation process was refined in the last steps of the research, and physical\u2013chemical details were noted. The control rules were applied once the system was validated and the prototype was installed and monitored.\n\nThis is the first commercial system created to automate and maintain a high, consistent standard of sausage drying. The commercialised DRYCHECK system benefits small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as larger manufacturers. The resulting business opportunities are from the sale of the software and firmware. Additional revenue can be generated from direct adaptation, installation and maintenance of the system plus customer service sales. Sales and service of the product are expected to generate over EUR\u00a02 million in revenue.
