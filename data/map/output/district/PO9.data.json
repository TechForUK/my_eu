For this reason the project stems from the activities already designed and developed by some Consortium members last year. The involved bodies and institutions belong to a geographical area called Bioregion of Alpi Apuane; this region is situated between the Serchio basin and the lower valley of the Magra river, around Alpi Apuane. The economic and geographic characteristics are the same in all the territory. It is an area supplied with interesting features: its natural landscapes  (e.g. the mountains overlooking the sea), its wide range of 20 DOP and IGP products, that is the highest at a national level,  its strategic position close to the best artistic towns of  Tuscany, reachable in less than an hour. Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany. Obviously, the territory needs to be adequately protected but it is also necessary an important action to promote and enhance it. However, this area presents different problems and weaknesses connected to the environment: the unsustainable development, based on a bad extraction of the marble, the abandonment of outlying areas, although their great historical interest, the climatic changes and the particular morphology that amplifies the effects of atmospheric agents (e.g. floods).\r\nStarting from this context, the project is addressed to 90 students of 6 High Schools related to the agricultural and tourist sector, located in the Bioregion of Alpi Apuane (15 participants per school). Participants must be enrolled in the last year of school or graduated within 12 months after graduation.\r\nThe project aims to transfer the right skills to improve and protect the environment, providing a good option to the current development model. This result could be achieved with the context and experience analysis of those European countries that managed to exploit, protect and promote their resources. \r\nThe traineeship will last three weeks and will be developed into innovative and dynamic companies of the following sectors: tourism, agriculture, agritourism and agribusiness.\r\nParticipants attended the agrarian school will:\r\n> develop skills about the planning action and land management practices, through the adaptation of the crops production and their use in respect of the climatic changes (resilience);\r\n> carry out actions concerning the land protection.\r\nParticipants attended  the tourist school will:\r\n> set up promotional actions and a tourist enhancement strategy of the available products and services;\r\n> plan tourist packages for a defined target customer, in order to foster this area through the use of  ICT and social media.\r\nParticipants activities are divided into the following steps:\r\n- project advertising for candidates recruitment. \r\n- Participants selection: it will be realized at each Consortium High School.\r\n- Training preparation: it will last 51 hours divided into seminars with a teacher (15 h) and e-learning (36 h). It will be organized at each school analysing different topics: the foreign languages (English or Spanish eLearning course), the hosting countries culture (orientation), technical aspects referring to the tourist or agricultural sector, workers'safety, self-entrepreneurship. An individual plan will be prepared for each participant, on the basis of their professional paths and not forgetting their entry level competences and the defined learning outcomes. Skills and knowledges are relative to the Regione Toscana directory, in particular to the ADA 377 \"Design, definition and promotion of tourist development plans\" or to the ADA1492 \"Analysis and monitoring of production and development\". During the meeting the staff will give participants information about the administration and the  management of the project phases.\r\n- Mobility: before the departure each participant will receive the tickets and the handbook; then they will develop a three weeks traineeship in UK, Spain, Ireland, Germany. The hosting partner will support participants during their stay, dealing with their reception, matching, monitoring and assessment. The consortium will perform monitoring actions contacting participants, partners and host organizations, by phone, skype, whatsapps and social media.\r\nAt the end of this experience the hosting organizations will give participants the Europass mobility and the ECVET certificate of the acquired skills.\r\n- Post mobility: at the mobility end participants will return the administrative documentation and will complete the final report.
