Moreover, these environmental intersections offer an extremely fertile training ground because exploration of interface process dynamics requires novel linkage between traditionally distinct disciplines, and development of a supra-disciplinary research and training philosophy to foster the evolution of a new generation of scientists.\nTraining and research will span novel distributed sensing technologies, innovative tracer methods and integrated numerical models of heat fluxes, metabolism, biogeochemical turnover and ecological functioning to understand how, when (hot moments) and why ecohydrological interfaces (e.g. aquatic-terrestrial, groundwater-surface water, marine-sediment interfaces) act as critical hotspots for water-dependent environmental processes. The urgently improved mechanistic process understanding developed by INTERFACES will not only provide industries, regulators and decision makers with the capacity to predict the complex, non-linear landscape-wide impacts of ecohydrological interfaces in a changing environment but also to understand how important ecosystem services provided by different ecohydrological interfaces can maintain or even enhance resilience to global environmental changes.'", 154472.0, 3040637.0, "INTERFACES", null, null, null, null, "http://www.silixa.com", null, "fp7_109579_952229989"], ["1GS", "VitaminD3-Omega3-Home Exercise- HeALTHy Ageing and Longevity Trial", "Pharmalys Ltd", "As the European population is ageing rapidly, the growing number of seniors with age-related chronic diseases poses a challenge on European societies and health care systems.
