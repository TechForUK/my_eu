To achieve this, we have certain staff development needs which we feel will be met through a project involving immersion training courses in Europe. We need to focus on building the confidence, skills, knowledge and experience of all staff in our MFL department. In particular, we need to ensure that our newly and recently qualified teachers are offered appropriate CPD to support them in their ability to teach. We want all staff to feel just as confident in a second language as they do in a first, to create more flexibility within the department. We want to inspire our pupils\u2019 curiosity about other countries and other cultures and encourage them to understand the significance and importance of languages, develop a sense of European citizenship and identity and see themselves as future linguists. We want to give them the opportunity to discover different people and cultures that they may not otherwise have available to them and establish contacts outside of their own immediate environment. A further objective is to ensure that we are equipped to teach the new GCSEs to the highest standard to give our pupils the best possible educational opportunities, improving resources and teaching methodology. We want to build professional networks that will mean that this sharing of ideas, materials and support can continue in the long term and have the experience of being in a Spanish/French school We want to increase the use of eTwinning with a view to giving language learning a real purpose and allowing pupils to comprehend a world beyond their own community, emphasising our key values such as mutual respect and tolerance and giving all our pupils a positive attitude towards languages and other cultures.We will involve create more extracurricular activities and extend our \u2018language ambassadors\u2019 strategy.We have developed a project plan to address the above needs involving immersion courses in Spain and France. The courses will involve intensive language training, a programme of cultural events and information, teaching methodology, access to resources and placement in a Spanish/French school. The resulting improvement in teaching will lead to better engagement of our pupils, more motivation for language learning, greater understanding of the relevance of languages to their own lives and a more open attitude towards other cultures. This will lead to greater uptake of languages and, in the long term, to improved aspiration and career opportunities and the promotion of our key values of mutual respect and tolerance.Teachers will have improved language confidence which will lead to the improvement in our language provision and consistency in teaching across the school. Spontaneous use of target language in class will increase, achieving the requirements of the new GCSE There will be a big impact on the teachers taking part in the training. They will all increase their Spanish and French language skills and will be confident that they are up-to-date with current usage. They will also very much increase their understanding of culture and current affairs. They will be equipped to teach both languages at higher levels. Creating professional links will mean that they have a long-lasting source of support.The creation of new teaching materials and integration of more authentic resources into our teaching will impact on students understanding of \u2018real\u2019 Spanish and French culture and make their learning more meaningful. We will be able to hold more cultural and international events in school. Creation of links with French/ Spanish schools will greatly impact on learning. It will be more enjoyable, students will see \u2018real\u2019 language and culture on a regular basis, more exposure to native speakers will improve their language learning and they will have the chance to form friendships with Spanish and French pupils and work together with them on projects. This will greatly impact on their outlook. They will see that they have many things in common with their French and Spanish counterparts and this will help to make them more open encourage them to continue to study languages, develop further curiosity about other cultures and see themselves as European citizens with many options to live, study and work abroad in their future lives.There will be more cooperation between departments and the MFL department will offer others in the school more support to bring an international outlook and European dimension to their subjects. Primary schools will benefit from support, advice, access to materials and suitable teaching ideas to improve their language provision and parents will have opportunities to learn languages through school. We will encourage other schools to get involved in similar projects leading to a huge impact on their language provision and furthering the aims of the Erasmus + programme.", "http://www.st-damians.tameside.sch.uk", "saint damiens RC Science college", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-024086_coordinator"], ["6NU", "RETOOLED: Rethinking and Envisioning TOOLs for EDucation", "LE PETIT ARTISTE THEATRE COMPANY CIC", 48130.0, "Based on the diagnosis made by all participating organizations and knowing the crucial role of youth work in providing equal opportunities for education and participation of youngsters in Europe and beyond, we decided to: 1.
