The importance given to language learning ( as seen with the 1+2 language policy) and the emphasis given to the acquisition of lifelong skills contribute to prove it. The GTCS in Scotland has equally highlighted the importance of continuous  teacher training as well as professional development.\r\n\r\nProject and School background:\r\nIn Dalkeith High school we are aiming to prepare our pupils with the experiences needed to be able to survive in  a more and more competitive labour markets, both at national and international levels. Our concern is to be able to provide all our pupils with equal opportunities and support those with difficult social background and very low self-esteem . Education, for some of them, is the only way they will have the chance to achieve. We want to decrease the percentage of young people leaving school with no qualifications. To succeed in our goal, we need to ensure that all practitioners are trained to the highest standards. \r\nThe participant has therefore  been encouraged to participate to further superior education as well as immersion training courses in order to be fully qualified and  registered  to teach a second language.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe main objective is to raise the profile of modern languages as well as  helping the school offer a wider experience in more than one language . The project will benefit  the teacher Continuous Professional Development as well  as promoting the learning of Spanish in our school and in our cluster primaries. \r\n\r\nNumber of participants:\r\nOne participant  has been selected to take part in  a 3 weeks immersion course in  Spain  in order to develop  linguistic and cultural knowledge. The training  is required in order to obtain full registration, after successfully graduating  in June 2016. \r\n\r\nMethodology to be used:\r\nThe participant can  report at school and  local authority levels and share experiences within the same school's  clusters. Head teacher or line manager  have to discuss positive outcomes for the learning of pupils as well as  engage in discussions with the participant concerning their professional development  and self evaluation. Appropriate curriculum content changes should be made to ensure that pupils are fully engaged and understand the importance of language learning. Cultural aspects should be embedded in the every day learning and teaching.\r\n\r\nDescription of results/impact envisaged:\r\nTeachers will have improved their linguistic skills and pupils will be exposed to the increased use of the target language. \r\nThe acquisition of the foreign language would then be facilitated  with the introduction of new technologies and pupils will then be more engaged and more likely to continue learning it in their senior years.\r\nUltimately, pupils will be confident  in talking a foreign language which will equip them with a life-long skill. They will be at the same level as  other  European learners which should help them increase their chances of employability . \r\nInternational partnership with European schools  will be encouraged  in order to give pupils an opportunity to practice their conversation skills in Spanish .\r\n\r\n Finally, practitioners will be given opportunities to reflect on their practice and make the necessary changes needed in order to give pupils an outstanding learning experience.

As a result, all class teachers are expected to deliver French as part of the curriculum and embed into their daily routine.  The local authority is running French/Spanish training courses, has employed 6 French MLAs supporting teachers and pupils, and is supporting teachers via the Development Officer (DO) providing a comprehensive professional development programme.  Nothing increases language capacity and confidence more than being immersed in the culture and using language on a daily basis.  The results from previous Erasmus+ candidates has improved the learning/teaching and also the level of enthusiasm/commitment.  This application is for 3 Primary teachers and the Development Officer.  Two of the teachers are very experienced and have both promoted languages in school.  The other teacher is in her 1st yr of teaching and is full of enthusiasm to support the others in implementing languages in the school.  The DO is keen to improve French and learn Spanish in order to better support teachers.   King's Park is already well underway in implementing an effective language programme but is constantly looking to up-skill teachers to deliver high quality teaching and learning.   The DO has responsibility for ensuring all schools in Midlothian are implementing the 1+2 policy and assist with French/Spanish training courses (PLL).   As part of the 1+2 initiative, schools are also being asked to introduce a second modern language (L3) from P5-7.  The DO is currently attending Spanish CLPL courses and is keen to have firsthand experience of the language/culture in order to support teachers and pupils alike.  The course activities include learning the target language with native speakers in a fun and engaging way.  The range of ideas and activities, including stories/rhymes/games French (and Spanish) children are taught, can be adopted in our school and give learning a real meaning.  As teachers will be experiencing putting French/Spanish learning into context, this will be transferred to our pupils.  Being immersed in the culture will give the teachers more confidence in planning cultural activities and making cultural links via E-Twinning.  The teaching of languages using ICT and Apps mean that this can be transferred directly into our classrooms and keep our learners up to date with current technology .  In Scotland, we follow a Curriculum for Excellence which is intended to help children and young people gain the knowledge, skills and attributes needed for life in the 21st century, including skills for learning, life and work.  The study of languages fits nicely into this aim with the four capacities of helping children become successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens and effective contributors.  The immersion programme is effectively allowing teachers to become all of the above which in turn will be transferred to the pupils.  The term curriculum is understood to mean - everything that is planned for children and young people throughout their education, not just what happens in the classroom .  The anticipated results and impact of this project are an increase in language capacity for pupils and staff alike; improved confidence in teaching French/Spanish and an improvement in the language learning experience of our pupils.  Pupils are being exposed to other languages much earlier than before and the results are amazing.  As a result of 1+2, we are already seeing an increase in language being spoken around the schools in Midlothian with visitors, friends and staff being greeted in French.  The more confident our teachers are, the more this will increase.  An exciting part of the immersion courses is the opportunity to learn alongside teachers from all over the UK.  This provides network opportunities for the continued sharing of resources and good practice.  Access to the many and varied resources used on the course means that a bank of resources can be built up centrally and shared with teachers.  This experience will inspire the participants to share their first-hand experiences with pupils, colleagues and parents.  The inclusion of the Development Officer will ensure she will be able to offer continued support in schools and opportunities for career long professional learning (CLPL) in language teaching. The longer term goal is to continue to raise the profile of languages in Scottish schools and hopefully lead to more secondary pupils making languages one of their choices.  It is our aim to help them understand that languages are fun by engaging them at an early age.  We also want to show them how languages can help with other subjects (eg literacy), open up opportunities to broaden their horizons through travel and increase their life chances through employability.", "http://Kingspark.mgfl.net", "King's Park Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035535_coordinator"], ["5AZ", "Fuertes ra\u00edces, esp\u00edritus perdurables.", "Lawfield Primary School", 6221.0, "CEIP \"El Carmen\" is located in the historic uptown of Cuenca. The building is quite old with the inconveniences associated with it, however, we enjoy countless activities offered by neighboring cultural institutions, such as museums, cathedral, etc. It is a one-line center in which students come from varied contexts that participate in the MEC / British Council agreement since 1996. The students of Early Childhood receive 12 weekly sessions of immersion in that language and those of Primary Education 13. The teaching staff is composed of 23 teachers, the majority being specialists in English.\r\nDue to the progressive renewal of the staff, the current teachers did not coincide with the stay of natives in the center and have not been able to enrich themselves with the knowledge they brought, not only about the language, but about the methodologies of the British curriculum. This is why, and because of the continuous desire of our entire educational community to improve learning methodologies so that they are in line with the principles of the Spanish-British integrated curriculum and the new teaching approaches at European level, the Erasmus + programme is requested.\r\nThe objectives and aims that are sought with the realization of this project are the following:\r\n- to learn new methodological techniques that involve the use of new technologies and learning by projects both elements very present in the British curriculum and in other European educational environments.\r\n- to improve the didactic approaches implemented to take full advantage of the integrated Spanish-British curriculum and be able to generate in our students more significant learning.\r\n- to learn from the experience of teachers from other European countries in the development of more attractive and motivating materials.\r\n- to enrich ourselves with the methodologies used in the United Kingdom, to be able to implement them in our center and improve the quality and effectiveness of Education for our students.\r\n- to establish links with UK schools so that we can learn from each other and develop more activities together.\r\n- to acquire in depth knowledge of the British curriculum and its culture.\r\nA large majority of the academic staff will participate in this project. Although the mobilities can only be done by a few teachers, all are focused on improving the implementation of the integrated curriculum, teaching through projects, the use of new technologies as educational tools and, in general, in the continuous training and the improvement of educational techniques that allow us to promote a European dimension of education so as to have an impact on the learning of our students. In this sense, the participation of the school board members will be different:\r\n-The management team supports the program and makes arrangements such as obtaining the PIC, etc.\r\n- Some teachers will carry out the mobilities and the structured courses and they will have to share the lessons learned from them with the whole educational community.\r\n- Part of the teachers will carry out online courses on learning by projects and the use of eTwinning.\r\n- We will all use the acquired knowledge to improve the habitual dynamics in the classroom.\r\nAs for the activities that we propose, they are summarized in: the realization of structured courses, direct observation visits in the classroom 'job shadowing' and online courses. The mobility stays ('job shadowing') will be carried out in the two partner centers of the United Kingdom, achieved through contacts established by the personnel involved in previous training stays. These centers will help us to achieve our objectives,such as acquiring a greater knowledge of the British curriculum, learning about learning by projects or the inclusion of ICT in the classroom. The structured courses meet the prescribed requirements since they are included in the guide offered by the Erasmus + program and, in addition, are aligned with the improvements that are intended to be achieved through this program.\r\nThe repercussion that the accomplishment of these activities is likely to have, will be reflected in the improvement of the competences of all the teaching staff, as well as in the motivation that the teaching staff will transmit to the students, families and the rest of the personnel of the center.\r\nIt will be a starting point for the continuous implementation of new methodologies that will be included in the classroom programming and that, in the long term, will modify the habitual procedure of the classroom and our didactic tools, in order to become a reference center both in the effective application of the integrated curriculum, and in the use of European influence teaching methodologies.\r\nIf approved, our project will be disseminated through platforms such as eTwinning,  School Education Gateway, local and regional press, school and Education Authority websites, School Council, AMPA (parents\u00b4 association).", "http://5541026", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049133_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH22"}
