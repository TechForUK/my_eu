The candidates\u00b4profile, although it is open, is mainly aimed to current and future participants in the bi-lingual programme developed in our school.Activities are aimed to foster teacher training in specialised institutions; to develop a deeper knowledge of other educational systems and methodologies through jobshadowing and teaching in our partners\u00b4 schools; and to promote collaborative learning and group working of the participants in the projects by preparing the mobilities, revising the results and introducing the new practices to the bi-lingual programme of our school. To top it all off, the experiences and the outcomes of the project will be shared by teachers of other schools through different specialised activities and institutions (Local Teacher Training Center, Regional Teacher Language Training Institution, Training Activity School 4 School).METHODOLOGYWe expect the project to have some very positive results for our school as well as the participant teachers. It improves teachers\u00b4 language skills; it promotes the use of new methodologies and practices both in teaching and in group and class organisation; it encourages the use of a specific vocabulary in CLIL subjects, taught in English.All these improvements will result in a more professional and specialised work environment for teaching in our CLIL programme. This will have a substantial positive impact in the area where our school is located; it will make possible the successful development of  a new learning model which prepares our pupils for an increasingly globalised social reality, both in their education and later their professional careers.These are the two main profits that we expect to achieve in a near future: An increasingly specialised teacher training in CLIL; and the introduction of pupils in a completely international learning and professional model, in addition to the development of a specialised learning in our school.", "http://www.helston.cornwall.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-023696_1"], ["8NR", "Trabajando en cooperaci\u00f3n, aprendiendo juntos", "Helston Community College", 15616.0, "In the last years our school has made two significant changes in the way it works. Initially, we started to teach some subjects in another language (bilingual section). Subsequently, we continue with a methodological change in introducing project learning. We present the project \"Working in Cooperation, learning together\" in order to continue the implementation of these teaching innovations. The project involves three more partners: an English school, located in a rural area and specialized in Spencer Kagan \u00b4s cooperative learning; an Italian school inserted in an urban area and dedicated to language teaching; and a Greek school willing to introduce innovations.\r\nOur objectives are focused on three aspects: to promote teacher training in languages and classroom methodologies;  to acquire skills and competencies in order to lead cohesive and effective teams; and to promote the integration of teachers and students in a more internationalized socio-cultural, training and professional reality.\r\n\r\nThe participating teachers will be 11 and their profile, although open, will be mainly intended for the members (current and future) in the bilingual program and the cooperative learning program that we run in our school.\r\nThe activities are dedicated to promoting the training of teachers in specialized institutions through a CLIL course and a course on school management; to becoming familiar with the educational and methodological realities of our partner through jobshadowing in Helston, UK; and to promoting teaching in the partner schools in order to practice a new methodology in the Italian case or to receive an external evaluation in the Greek case. The correct preparation and fulfilment of the visits, the revision of the results and the incorporation of the new practices in our teaching will contribute to the success of the project.\r\n\r\nWe expect the project to have some very positive results for  our school, as well as for the participating teachers and our community. We hope that the colaboration with our partners will be lasting and in the future we will renew our commitment with a Strategic Partnership. The experiences and results will be shared with other colleagues through our collaboration with specialized institutions in teacher training.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge, abilities and skills acquired will create a more professional and specialized work environment and will result in the improvement of the training received by the students. The impact of this program in our local community, will enable the development and success of a teaching and learning model that prepares our students for an increasingly globalized social reality, both in training and in professional development.\r\nThese are the two great benefits that we hope to obtain in the longer term: the development of a specialized education in the school and the insertion of our students in a fully internationalized professional and training model.", "http://www.helston.cornwall.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-035342_1"], ["0NG", "Raising attainment of key competencies in Early Years and Primary Years through enquiry based learning and outdoor education", "Boskenwyn CP School", 11792.0, "Context/background of project\r\nAs the focus for primary education is changing from how we teach to focus more on how children learn, it is imperative that staff are retrained and prepared by observing good practice in places where educational standards are high. The PISA league tables have helped us to identify countries in which educational achievement is high, this included Norway and Finland. Further research into the education provided in these two countries leads us to enquiry based learning, focusing on child-led, topic based learning, particularly taught through the IB curriculum in International Schools and through outdoor education in state schools and kindergartens. Focusing on growth mindset, lifelong and transferable skills such as resilience, independence, problem solving in these countries are the norm and we believe, the reason for the success in these schools and for a high percentage of the children there, including those with special educational needs going on to further education, a much higher figure than the UK, is down to their pedagogical approach. This approach is in it's infancy in England and without conducting research and travelling abroad to observe this practice, it is near on impossible to improve Uk practice and to follow in the footsteps of successful neighbours. As a small primary school, which is part of a larger Cooperative trust, we want to be at the forefront of educational reform in our country by implementing the successful strategies for raising attainment in key competencies that we observe in higher attaining countries and sharing this practice nationwide.\r\nObjective of Project\r\nWe aim to visit a variety of schools in Norway and Finland to job shadow and observe good practice, the practice which leads to high educational attainment. Schools we will visit include International Schools, state schools and kindergartens, Montessori and Reggio Emilia settings. We have already established contacts with some of these schools and they are happy for us to visit and share their pedagogy with us. We have included Tromso International School as our main partner as we already have an established contact with them. Our ultimate objective is to raise emotional and educational attainment and inclusivity in our primary schools and preschools by implementing the best practice observed in Norway and Finland. All teaching and non-teaching staff (17) with a wealth of teaching and learning experience will be involved in the project so that it is an ethos rather than a strategy which is embedded into our school life. Parents, children and governors will be involved on our journey of implementation.\r\nMethodology to be used \r\nIn order to carry out the project successfully and fairly, each member of staff will be involved in more research and the compilation of question sets and observation sheets ahead of the visit. These will be used in each school we visit and along with photos and discussions with classteachers and principals these will inform their final reports. Data analysis will take place and compared to UK performance. Staff will shadow a teacher and become involved in the day to day practice of the school they are visiting for 5 days. There will be a staff meeting at the end of each school day to discuss and evaluate progress and practice followed by immersion into the culture of the area.\r\nResults and impact envisaged\r\nWe envisage a positive impact on the emotional and academic attainment of our primary school children as we introduce and embed the learning ethos  and strategies/pedagogy learned and observed into our school life. We believe that by embedding this approach to learning we will see children develop into responsible, resilient, global citizens. Children will have transferable lifelong learning skills which they can carry with them into further education and the world of work and will be confident in trying new things and visiting new places. Teachers' experience in different countries and their experience gained will not only benefit the children and introduce an international dimension but it will improve their practice and allow them to be more creative within the British National Curriculum. It will give staff the confidence to evolve their role from teacher to facilitator of learning. We also believe the impact of this educational reform will close the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers.\r\nPotential longer term benefits\r\nWe aim to share our findings with other schools in our Cooperative Trust and provide courses and training materials for other schools to observe our practice once implemented and embedded.

It  is imperative that staff are retrained and prepared for this by learning about and observing good practice in places where educational standards are high. The PISA league tables helped us to identify countries where educational achievement is high due to inquiry based learning through the IB curriculum in International Schools, phenomena based learning  and outdoor learning in state schools and kindergartens. Along with other pedagogy like the Hjalla method of promoting freedom from gender oppression and the Reggio Emilia principles of the hundred languages of children we believe are the reasons for success in these countries and we would like to learn from more them. Our previous project has led us to valuable contacts and made us eager to learn more.
