NANOREM\u2019s ambitious objectives are:\n1) Identification of the most appropriate nanoremediation technological approaches to achieve a step change in practical remediation performance. Development of lower cost production techniques and production at commercially relevant scales, also for large scale applications. 2) Determination of the mobility and migration potential of nanoparticles in the subsurface, and their potential to cause harm, focusing on the NP types most likely to be adopted into practical use in the EU.\n3) Development of a comprehensive tool box for field scale observation of nanoremediation performance and determination of the fate of NPs in the subsurface, including analytical methods, field measurement devices, decision support and numerical tools.\n4) Dissemination and dialogue with key stakeholder interests to ensure that research, development and demonstration meets end-user and regulatory requirements and information and knowledge is shared widely across the EU.\n5) Provide applications at representative scales including field sites to validate cost, performance, and fate and transport findings.\nThe NANOREM consortium is multidisciplinary, cross-sectoral and transnational. It includes 28 partners from 12 countries organized in 11 work packages.

To achieve the EU's goals of cleaning these up by 2050, more drastic solutions than those currently available need to be researched.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded http://www.nanorem.eu (NANOREM) project aims to develop and test nanotechnological tools to remediate contaminated land in Europe. NANOREM began by reviewing similar projects around the world, identifying 70 other projects at pilot or commercial scale.\n\nProject members created a number of different nanoparticles, including nano zero valent iron (nZVI) and non-zero valent iron (non ZVI) nanoparticles. These particles can be used to remediate land or water bodies contaminated with industrial waste. The nanoparticles have been through a range of tests to standardise their use in the field.\n\nNANOREM also developed a range of other tests and methods needed for field testing nanoparticle remediation strategies. Finally, the nanoparticles were confirmed to be harmless to terrestrial and aquatic organisms that would be exposed to them.\n\nResearchers are now setting up three large-scale field trials, including artificially contaminating areas for remediation. Once these sites have been established, NANOREM will begin trials to see whether the nanoparticle technology can be used for decontamination at other sites.\n\nIf successful, NANOREM will pave the way to a new era of land remediation through new knowledge and methods.", "http://www.nanorem.eu/", "http://www.r3environmental.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159275.jpg", "fp7_106322_991335733"], ["8NN", "Holistic Management of Brownfield Regeneration", "R3 Environmental Technology Limited", "HOMBRE seeks to achieve a paradigm shift in sustainable brownfield land management practice.

The school bases its teaching and learning around the 5 'Core Values': Determination, Enthusiasm, Cooperation, Respect and Compassion; with children's rights being of paramount importance. As part of school improvement, Caversham identified the need to develop the European dimension in the school with the aims of: enhancing the teaching and learning of citizenship across the school; empowering children to become active citizens and learners and providing opportunities to learn about sustainable development through the UN Global Goals.\r\n\r\nThe broad objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n*To understand how citizenship is taught in other countries across Europe and how this links into other curriculum areas\r\n*To work collaboratively with our partner school on joint projects in relation to citizenship, environment (sustainability) and children's rights.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 we used etwinning to find a school with similar interests and we successfully developed a partnership with Nuolialan koulu in Pirkkala, Finland. The school is a large school made up of pre-school and primary (grades 1- 6) and is expanding to include secondary school pupils (grades 7-9). The school is involved in a sustainability project and, as part of the introduction of a new Finnish curriculum, has a particular interest in global citizenship.\r\n\r\nAfter an introductory project sharing information about both schools, Nuolialan koulu applied for KA1 funding to visit us to understand our teaching of citizenship and with a particular focus on provision for children with SEN. Two teachers came to  Caversham in November 2016 and undertook job-showing activities and interviews with subject coordinators.\r\n\r\nBoth schools have continued to work together and, in order to meet Caversham Primary's development needs, have planned for teachers from Caversham to visit Finland to better understand the teaching of citizenship in other countries and to benefit from learning about Nuolialan koulu's sustainability project. Two teachers from Caversham will travel to Finland and participate in a week of timetabled observations, interviews and joint planning time in order to plan a detailed project of continued cooperation between the two schools. They will gather information, keep records of observations, report back to all stakeholders and communicate their visit through a blog on the school Virtual Learning Environment.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be such that Caversham can: compare citizenship teaching between countries and use this learning to enhance the teaching and learning in our school; plan collaborative projects with a focus on citizenship and sustainability; empower pupils to work in partnership with Finnish pupils to promote positive change in the world; and develop a scheme of work/series of lessons across the school so that the whole school community will benefit from the partnership working.\r\n\r\nThis work will be shared with governors, at subject coordinator network meetings and through a series of dedicated staff training time in order to have maximum impact on staff and pupils.
