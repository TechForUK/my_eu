The objective of RISCS is to provide fundamental research on environmental impacts, necessary to underpin frameworks for the safe management of CO2 storage sites. To achieve this, RISCS will quantitatively assess environmental impacts from exposure to known CO2 fluxes. The assessments will be based on field laboratory experiments, measurements at natural leakage sites and numerical simulations, for both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. This will provide new constraints on the impacts of CO2 leakage on humans and onshore and offshore ecosystems. RISCS will provide the underpinning information necessary to: 1. Rigorously evaluate the safety of different storage sites 2. Carry out Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) over different timescales 3. Design storage sites to minimise hazards 4. Help to design near surface monitoring strategies 5. Refine storage licence applications and conditions 6. Develop a framework to communicate the safety of storage to key stakeholders This approach will meet the requirements of OSPAR and the EC Directive both in ensuring environmental protection and the planning of near surface monitoring programmes. The US EPA has recently published rules for CO2 storage, and a \u2018Vulnerability Evaluation Framework for geological sequestration of CO2\u2019. RISCS will build on this approach, creating a similar framework addressing European needs. In order to meet these objectives we have assembled a team with very specific and focussed expertise, enabling us to assess both northern and southern European impacts scenarios, onshore and offshore. To maintain a full external perspective on the research, from both scientific and public acceptance viewpoints, we have enlisted leading CCS experts from CSLF partner countries, two NGOs, the IEA GHG programme and industry.", 250117.0, 4458870.0, "RISCS", "Estimating the impact of carbon storage", "Scientists have assessed the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage on onshore and offshore ecosystems using field experiments, modelling and observations of natural CO2 emissions.", "Geological carbon capture and storage (CCS) is seen as an essential part of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, little information on the environmental impact of a CO2 leak from a CCS site was available.\n\nThe objective of the EU-funded 'Research into impacts and safety in CO2 storage (RISCS)' (http://www.riscs-co2.eu/ (RISCS)) project was to conduct fundamental research that could shape frameworks for the safe management of CO2 storage sites. The project studied the potential impact of a CO2 leak on both marine and terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nIn Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, marine scientists examined the effect of CO2 exposure on individual species (like shrimp and crabs) and communities, including microorganisms. They also examined the recovery potential of marine sediments after CO2 exposure and studied the effects of natural CO2.\n\nNorway and the United Kingdom were host to onshore experiments that assessed the impact of CO2 on oats, wheat, barley and oilseed rape. Grass/clover cover, pasture plots and groundwater were also investigated, the latter at natural CO2 sites in Greece, France and Italy.\n\nOther work involved numerical modelling of the movement of CO2 onshore through the soil and its effect on plants. Marine modelling focused on the dispersion of CO2 in the water column by tides and the sensitivity of different species to CO2.\n\nThe key results obtained during the study have been compiled into a guide to potential impacts of leakage from CO2 storage. This provides a sound basis for the selection of appropriate CO2 storage sites and safety measures. It will also allow site operators and regulators to assess the potential impacts of leaks on near-surface ecosystems.\n\nGenerally speaking, the project found that the environmental impact of a gas leak is likely to be limited, unless an isolated habitat is affected, but will depend on the location, size, timing and duration of the leak. RISCS also showed that there is a need for good monitoring data to help recognise a CCS leakage event.", null, "http://www.quintessa.org", "/docs/results/images/2015/153755.jpg", "fp7_93462_996752407"], ["4JL", "GET: Global E-health Transforming services", "Health 2.0 Limited", "The GET project will deliver four high-impact services to eHealth SMEs and entrepreneurs in order to boost their growth and move them to the next level of competitiveness.

This will be achieved by cooperation between design and engineering, science and performance assessment. The evolution from an installed engineered system to a fully functioning barrier will be assessed. One of the challenges is to take into account initial heterogeneities introduced in the system by conception with a combination of block and pellets or due to the size of the bentonite component (several 100 m3). It will require a more detailed understanding of material properties, of the fundamental processes that lead to homogenisation, of the role of scale effects and improved capabilities for numerical modelling. The goal is to verify the performance of current designs for buffers, backfills, seals and plugs. The overall driver for the project is the assessment cases that will be defined at the onset of the project (WP1). The quantitative models currently available are not fully able to represent all the complexities of the evolution of an installed bentonite. A substantial effort is needed to improve both the conceptual approaches and the numerical solutions in the current models (WP3). The updated/newly developed models need to be tested and verified using available data (WP5).  There are some areas where fundamental data and the understanding of materials are incomplete. An efficient experimental programme will support model development and testing (WP4). There is already a large database from experiments performed within EC projects and national programmes, both laboratory and Underground Research Laboratory (URL) experiments.
