Therefore, the immigrant families in the European countries are facing issues with properly integrating into countries in Europe while keeping a sense of belonging to their own culture.  \r\n\r\nSome of these immigrant families come from Bosnia and Herzegovina who were forced to leave their country in the early 1990s due to the Bosnian Civil War.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.
