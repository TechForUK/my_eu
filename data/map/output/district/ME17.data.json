Bedfont Scientific Ltd offers a portable H. pylori diagnostic device, HYscreen, which detects ammonia in exhaled air as a biomarker for H. pylori. It has a rapid diagnosis, higher accuracy, lower cost, greater simplicity and convenience. It has the following innovation features: a mouthpiece breath entrapment sampling system, a thermal oxidizer and a Nitrogen Oxide (NO) sensor. This solution is aimed at primary and secondary care in Europe and USA and population screening programs in Asia, answering the call for a cheaper, quicker and simpler monitoring device. This will lead to improved clinical decisions that will facilitate early treatment of the infection, preventing H pylori related cases of gastric cancer and gastric or duodenal ulcers. Consequently, Europe-wide and global savings of up to \u20ac1.5 billion and \u20ac5.66 billion respectively will be realized by avoiding unnecessary endoscopies, biopsies, expensive H. pylori tests and the healthcare bill from H. pylori-related conditions. Ultimately, HYscreen will open doors for fast and affordable population wide screening. The test will use cheaper C12 urea, though work still needs to be done to make it commercially available.\nThere is a challenge to shorten the thermal oxidizer system for better aesthetics and to reduce ammonia absorption. In Phase 1, we study the feasibility of optimizing the thermal oxidizer system, the use and optimization of C12 urea, protection of the product and the detailed business plan. Phase 2 will produce the final product from the prototype along with the validation steps and clinical trials.", 35902.0, 51289.0, "HYscreen", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196432_936083854"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3HN", "Enhancing teaching and learning in MFL department", "United Westminster School's Foundation", 1453.0, "The project will have a very clear outcome. An entire unit of work that will be part of our over all French teaching in Scheme.\r\nThe unit in questions will explore the links between French culture and French language. We are hoping to facilitate to our students a greater sense of cultural awareness whilst they are mastering the intricacies of the language.\r\nWe have identified our GCSE groups as our target audience for the main outcome of the course and the project, but we might consider adapting the Unit of Work produced  so it is age appropriate and valid for younger/ older students.\r\n\r\nThe main participant and leader of the course is Mrs Sylvia Gorman. She has been selected within our faculty as the most suitable candidate to attend the course and then coordinate all the necessary stages to deliver the above  outcome.\r\n\r\nWe will apply the same assessment and delivery methodology that we use when facilitating other unit of work within our scheme but we are also looking forward to gaining i through the selected course  further teaching techniques to develop  our students'  knowledge and understanding of the targeted language.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is  to address the lack of social awareness of our students who after years studying the targeted language ( French) they  have huge gaps in their cultural knowledge of France and its membership to the EU.\r\n\r\nLong term, we envisage the outcome of the project to  serve as a model within our school so that other Departments are able to link culture to their given area of academic expertise.", "http://www.svs.org.uk", "United Westminster School's Foundation", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013041_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ME17"}
