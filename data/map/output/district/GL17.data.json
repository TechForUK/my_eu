The project is set within the context of an increasingly important place in contemporary European public life of religions, in particular of Islam and religions of the East. They become increasingly important not only as a result of migration processes (e.g. changes in local communities affected by new incomers) but also as a result of global affairs (e.g. the influence of the conflict in Syria on Islamic communities in Europe). Various phenomena arising from the growing presence of new religious communities are usually simplified and stereotyped in the media, which leads to exclusion and marginalisation based on lack of knowledge or lack of willingness to reach out to people of different faith. This is where interfaith dialogue provides an exceptional and distinctive tool of education.  The main objective of these two training courses is Interfaith Dialogue and its impact on intercultural learning in youth work, notably in European context. The attention of this project will be on religions of the East (these religions include Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Bahaism, Taoism and Confucianism), and their relationship with other religions present in Europe.

Theatre is an exceptional educational method. It provides a unique opportunity of expressing emotions and opinions, as well as presenting issues or cases in order to raise their saliency, provide learning opportunity and immeasurable impact on both the performers (or actors) and the audience. Unconventional theatre methods increase this impact, by associating the performers and the audience in a performance, through an experiential involvement. The universality of theatre tools presents a remarkable prospect for non-formal education and youth work (e.g. the theatre of the oppressed as a tool in youth work). \r\nWhile many international projects express their willingness to apply theatre as their main methodological framework, we, as the core group of the project have discovered that very often they lack the basic understanding of theoretical underpinnings of theatre as such which limits the learning outcomes of participants. Theatre therefore is an exceptional mean of not only reaching out to young people but also to empowering them. We will use a mixture of formal and non-formal methods, as well as the theatre methodology. The key objective of the course is to look forward to the increase of the competencies of participants of the use of theatre methods in work with youth as well as to impact them personally, thus empowering them directly. We will focus on community theatre - an opportunity for every individual to be involved in the performance.\r\n As a result we anticipate that the project will enable its participants to obtain the ability to apply theatre as a tool of various activities with young people, addressing issues of particular importance to local communities from which young people come from.

The following abilities are aimed for: know their own body, mix with other people, observe the environment and get autonomy to do everyday activities.\r\n\r\nThe educational work depends on the basic needs of children: sleep, food, hygiene, care, affection, without overlooking stimulating activities aimed at children\u2019s integral development. All the activities in this stage must be educational and formative (form changing diapers to telling stories).\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the work in this stage is the socialization of children: they must get used to live with others, collectively respond to adult\u2019s instructions and show respect for educator\u2019s rules. Children should feel loved so it is easier for them to show affection, the atmosphere should be warm to make their progression possible. Children must feel confident and well cared so they can build a positive self image. All these aspects are the basis of attention to diversity.\r\n\r\nTime arrangements are very important on this stage since each child will have to adapt his own biological pace to the group.\r\n\r\nThe spaces will be organized in such a way that the children will be able to work on independent activities: playing, resting, moving.  This will be for the children to become more and more autonomous.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers\u2019 role in this project is to support the educators in each one of the groups of children in the Local Nursery.  Under no circumstances will the volunteers supply any of the teachers, they will just work together with them. They will be supported and coordinated by the person in charge of the project so they get guidance to reach the aims of it.\r\n\r\nWorkshops will also be developed linguistic expression in English and sports shops, with children 6 to 12 years, depending on the skills, characteristics and  capabilities of volunteers, so he or the volunteer can develop their potential, contribute to  development of children, promoting socialization and autonomy and contribute to the awareness of the citizens of San Clemente of belonging to Europe..\r\n\r\nIt will be a process of non-formal learning in which the volunteers will have the chance to develop personal, social and intercultural abilities.

Although it is known to human for centuries its codification can be traced only to The Dartington Conference of 1975, which provided its definition as \u201cthose activities concerned with living, moving and learning in the outdoors\u201d, involving awareness and respect for oneself, others and the environment. Although it is present in international youth work, it still remains an often overlooked method of education, primarily due to the rigorous health and safety measures it requires. This creates an opportunity to share the example of good practice of the UK educational system and its culture of a health and safety based approach to organisations from other European countries and primarily to young people representing them. \r\n\r\nASHA Outdoor Education (AOE) Training Course is a project aimed at mainstreaming of outdoor education, in addition to focus on the promotion of healthy lifestyles and the life in harmony with the natural environment. It will take place in April 2015. The project is a continuation of a successful series of outdoor education projects organised by ASHA in 2012 and 2013, including local volunteering projects and an international youth exchange. \r\n\r\nThis project will be carried out for 30 participants from eight organisations from different European countries. We have received a lot of interest in the project from organisations working on outdoor education in Romania. We have therefore decided to invite two organisations from Romania. Participants will include youth workers, volunteers as well as activists willing to learn and to share everything they will learn and experience (their skills, knowledge and positive attitudes) with others in Europe (and in their own communities). \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are:\r\n\r\n- Promoting outdoor education as an inclusive tool in youth work;\r\n- Equipping participants with skills for outdoor education including preparation of activities, risk assessment, health and safety measures and outdoor methods;\r\n- Reflecting on the learning benefits of using the outdoors: health, lifestyle, connecting to nature, protecting the environment, fighting global warming;\r\n- Increasing youth participation through outdoor education;\r\n- Reflecting on the use of outdoor education in various Erasmus + projects (and Key Actions);\r\n- Developing further co-operation of partner promoter organisations in the field of outdoor education including future Key Action 1 activities or EVS projects.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the project, participants will be equipped with tools and methods for outdoor education. They will have a chance to reflect on the changing lifestyles of young people and the beneficial effects of using outdoor methods, promoting healthier lifestyles, bringing young people closer to nature and the countryside. The potential long term results include increased competencies of all participants, but also inclusion of youngsters with fewer opportunities and those from culturally diverse backgrounds from among them. Finally we are hoping for a \u2018mainstreaming effect\u2019 of outdoor education as an educational tool not only for future international activities but also for small local projects (initially organised by all of our partner organisations). \r\n\r\nThis will be done through a number of activities run in the Forest of Dean, where all participants will be accommodated and where the project will be carried out. The ASHA Centre is situated in a uniquely beautiful spot in the Forest, with access to all outdoor \u201clearning facilities\u201d possible.

The project is a direct response to one of the most pressing challenges of young people all over Europe \u2013 to unemployment. Some even call it a civilizational challenge which leaves hundreds of thousands of young people out of work, which will undoubtedly negatively affect our societies. At the same time however an increased number of peoples' initiatives emerge, with all of them under the common umbrella-explanation of entrepreneurship. These new emerging businesses create a very large proportion of innovative products and services that transform the way we work and live, such as personal computers, software, social media (or internet in general), or more local businesses such as production of organic food or storage facilities. What is more, they generate new jobs, thus directly responding to the needs of the unemployed. In many instances it is unemployed themselves taking the initiative and through their own creativity and innovation creating various ventures (ranging from social to business enterprises) by and for themselves as well as for others. But what exactly is this phenomenon of social entrepreneurship? How should we understand it? How can young people understand it? This project will explore these questions, through various methods including Timmons entrepreneurship framework, introduction of \u2018your opportunity journal\u2019, as well as case studies, simulation activities, brainstorming activities and the use of theatre methods. All of these working methods will be based on active involvement (and active participation of course!) of all of the participants. \r\nAll of it will be done in order to achieve the following objectives:\r\n- to identify the entrepreneurial potential of each individual and organisation participating in the project;\r\n- to provide participants with examples of successful local social and business ventures developed by young entrepreneurs and to learn from the experience of social enterprises based in the Forest of Dean (Taurus Crafts, George Caf\u00e9, amongst others); \r\n- to give participants knowledge about the entrepreneurship development process, from the identification of an idea or a need, through its development to management;\r\n- to develop participants' basic social entrepreneurial skills in young people; \r\n- to increase their confidence and build on their positive attitudes towards the risk-taking which (social) entrepreneurship requires;\r\n- to provide participants with information about possible funding sources for their start-up ideas, including European schemes such as Erasmus +\r\n- to promote European funding opportunities (including E+) as tools for future ventures but also as tools supporting education towards entrepreneurship.\r\nThe result we aim at is to provide with entrepreneurial competencies, including basic knowledge, skills and attitudes required to foster young people\u2019s creativity and social entrepreneurship. And then for them to multiply everything they have learned further, in their local communities.

It will provide participants with competencies in using two innovative methods of studying cultural diversity \u2013 storytelling and music. \r\nMusic and the art of telling stories are the only universal language promoting reading, creativity, comprehension and a mean through which our cultures can be translated to the others (who do not speak the same language as us). With this project we want to address all of these issues directly, promoting storytelling and music not only as tools but also as means of intercultural learning. The project idea came directly from young people who, upon their experiences in participation in international projects abroad, reflected on the importance of national stories and of the music, and a surprising lack of its conscious use of both of them as educational tools when studying about cultural diversity and intercultural learning. The project combines the \u2018old\u2019 with the \u2018new\u2019. Whereas storytelling is one of the oldest (and unfortunately forgotten) methods of exploring diversity (fortunately still very much present in the UK!) music always seems to remain to be the area of expertise of young people. The project will therefore address both sets of tools exploring their varieties as well as empowering participants to be their educational ambassadors.  \r\n\r\nThe first course will provide participants with competencies in using storytelling as a tool of exploration of cultural diversity and of intercultural education. The project will promote storytelling as a universal educational tool - participants will not only learn about the principles of storytelling, but will also show them how they themselves can adapt stories from various corners of Europe, from various periods or cultures for educational purposes. Methods here will be based on stories, the art of telling them, the importance of words and their contexts. Activities will be based on non-formal education and will actively involve all of the participants. We will also use the following resources:\r\n\r\n- Compass HRE Manual - New December 2012 Edition (Council of Europe)\r\nhttp://www.eycb.coe.int/compass/en/contents.html\r\n- Mosaic T-Kit for Euromeditteranean Youth Work (CoE-EU Youth Partnership)\r\nhttp://book.coe.int/EN/ficheouvrage.php?PAGEID=36&lang=EN&produit_aliasid=2482\r\n- Compasito Manual for HRE with Children http://www.eycb.coe.int/compasito/default.htm\r\n\r\nAll participants will be actively co-facilitating numerous sessions \u2013 they are the storytellers after all!\r\n\r\nThe second course focuses on the role music plays in cultural diversity. The course is an educational journey through music styles and methods of communication with young people coming from different ethnic, national and cultural backgrounds through music, aiming at equipping participants with competences in intercultural communication. The programme of the course is based on non-formal exploratory methods including various modes of play and improvisation. We will be learning simple but profound pieces of World Music engaging participants through songs, rounds, rhythm-pieces and games. The programme will be lead jointly by Adrian Locher, ASHA\u2019s Artistic Director, actor, voice coach and director and Gregers Brinch, composer/singer/director and teacher. The course will facilitate an unfolding of aspects of creativity that can strengthen participants\u2019 intercultural skills such as working together in multicultural groups, creativity and entrepreneurship, practicing leadership and problem-solving.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- raise the awareness of the importance of music as a tool of intercultural learning and communication;\r\n- develop participants\u2019 knowledge of how music is used in formal educational systems in Europe\r\n- develop participants\u2019 skills as to how music can be used in non-formal education as a tool;\r\n- to raise participants\u2019 awareness of how music affects intercultural communication;\r\n- to promote European mobility and educational programmes as tools for intercultural learning\r\nAll of the activities will be primarily aimed at the social and personal development of all of the participants, their increased intercultural awareness. We will however include sessions aimed at looking towards the future \u2013 creating a snowball effect and encouraging participants to use the competencies gained to run future activities in their local areas or internationally, also via the Erasmus + funding opportunities. The result we are looking forward therefore is the \u2018snowball effect\u2019!

Due to high demand and interest among European partners, we have jointly decided to divide the project into two activities (one in June and one in September 2015). \r\n\r\nThis project will involve two groups of 32 youth workers (64 youth workers in total) from ten organisations based in nine European countries. The objectives of this project - and intended impact includes:\r\n- To increase youth worker competences in volunteer management\r\n- To promote volunteering among young Europeans\r\n- To reflect on the nature of voluntary work and its importance to young people today, especially in relation to their current socio-economic needs (employment, social inclusion)\r\n- To exchange experience and good practice in youth volunteering \r\n- To further the co-operation between project partners, notably within the Erasmus+ EVS Programme\r\nAs a result of the project, participants will have a better understanding of volunteering as a tool and method in youth work practice. They will have a chance to reflect on the needs of young people and the beneficial effects of volunteering. \r\nLong-term project impact includes increased capacity of partner organisations to organise volunteer projects and development of joint EVS projects and other Erasmus+ projects. \r\n\r\nThe ASHA Centre is a hub of volunteering activities. We regularly host EVS and Horizon Programme volunteers from across Europe. We occasionally host international volunteers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Additionally, ASHA engages the local community in the Forest of Dean in a range of volunteer activities on its premises, including at ASHA\u2019s Biodynamic Garden.

Human well-being achievement at the level of countries receives special attention. It is now commonplace for international agencies, such as United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank, to publish annual reports that rank countries according to various well-being or well-being related indicators. At the same time the obesity levels of youth are rising on uncontrollable (and scary!) levels. So despite the fact that various theorists analyse well-being on a number of indicators, such as political, income-based, social, gender, sustainability and various composite indexes, young people are merely numbers. And limited attention (and initiatives) are actually introduced in order to address the reasons of the lack of well-being, rather than to merely analyse it.\r\nThis project directly responds to that problem. Young people who come to the ASHA Centre are often stimulated to ask questions about day-to-day personal well-being, and we aim to support them in making positive life-style choices. Surrounded by the Forest of Dean, the ASHA Centre provides an excellent setting for improving well \u2013being. We regularly host groups that practice yoga, meditation, counseling. We have a biodynamic garden producing healthy, vital, organic food for our volunteers and course(s) participants. Not only therefore we want to address the theory of well-being, we want to empower young participants with a mixture of tools which will allow them not only to educate others about well-being, but also apply them in practice for themselves, their families, nearest neighbourhoods, etc.  \r\nAll of the activities planned for the project have one objective - to promote the social and personal development of young people. This is the reason behind our topic (well-being of young people) as well as programme and the methods planned. Young people will be directly involved in the process and implementation of activities. The fact that our methodology will be based on non-formal education, will assure not only focus on individual development of every single participant, but also create an opportunity to challenge them (participants), take them out of their comfort zones, to maximise the impact of learning-by-doing.\r\nWe seek to train 64 participants (32 in each of the two courses) in the principles of well-being (issues, concept and measures) as well as with practical tools and methods of how young people could be educated about well-being. Why two courses? Because we have received a high number of quality enquiries about partnership in this project, which allows us to approach a bigger number of young people from different European countries. Participants will be volunteers, youth workers and/or activists from local NGOs directly working on youth empowerment in different local settings in Europe. \r\nWe hope that the ultimate result of this project will be a group of 64 highly motivated and empowered individuals who will draw inspiration from the educational experience we plan to offer in order to use it in their own organisations. The aim of this project is to put all of the ideas, tools and methods in practice in order to educate young people on well-being. Although we aim at the empowerment of 64 individuals, we hope that the project\u2019s reach will exceed 600 and will impact all possible local communities. We will also encourage participants to design and then implement their own well-being based projects, thus increasing the impact beyond Forest of Dean/partnership organisations!\r\nThe project will take place in the ASHA Centre, at the edge of the Forest of Dean, in an environment that is health giving, intentionally designed to be therapeutic, beautiful and inspiring.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "The ASHA Foundation", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012070_coordinator"], ["0EA", "THE ASHA 'VOLUNTEER FOR CHANGE' EVS PROJECT 8th edition", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 71440.0, "The ASHA Foundation is a charity which encourages and supports philanthropy worldwide and works for youth empowerment, interfaith and intercultural understanding and sustainable development. \r\n\r\nThis EVS project involves ten volunteers from Spain, Germany, Ukraine, Turkey  and Palestine for a period of eleven months (September 2015 \u2013 August 2016) to volunteer at the ASHA Centre, Gloucestershire, UK.

Its learning outcomes include an increased understanding of sustainable living, team building, leadership, customer service and hospitality skills, facilitation skills and active youth work. The ASHA Centre has successfully implemented a range of international activities fostering peace and intercultural dialogue. We regularly host local and international groups for different projects promoting the exchange of ideas, harmony and coexistence.

Participants will analyse the skills necessary in their work and will choose the universal set of competencies essential to resolve conflicts in an intercultural environment.

We strongly believe that non formal education has a very significant impact on youth employability and socio-professional insertion, enhancing in particular 5 of the 6 soft skills which are the most looked for by employers on the labour market: self-management, problem solving, communication, leadership skills and competence in working with others.\r\n\r\nIt aims more specifically at:\r\n-Strengthening a pool of certified quality peer educators;\r\n-Supporting youth in their lifetime personal and professional development;\r\n-Having more impact on vulnerable youth through our local multipliers;\r\n-Reflecting on and advocating for the impact of peer education on youth employability;\r\n-Positioning EPTO as the European leader of quality peer education.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, EPTO and its partners will implement 2 main activities:\r\n\r\n-A Certification training for peer trainers in Cluj Napoca (RO), a 5-day training for participants who previously attended an EPTO awareness-raising training on anti-discrimination, risk and well-being to complete their train-the-trainer cycle and be allowed to use the EPTO manual for workshops (up to 3 days) in their local environments.\r\nThe activity aims to:\r\n-Further train peers in the fields of anti-discrimination, risk and well-being education;\r\n-Improve their soft skills on facilitation and social action;\r\n-Strengthen EPTO's pool of certified quality peer trainers;\r\n-Initiate a snowball effect of social change through local multipliers.\r\n\r\nThis training will be attended by 20 youth leaders (mostly trainers and social workers from the youth sector), who want to explore further and acquire more skills in peer education, facilitation and social action. The team will be composed by 2 professional trainers, an apprentice trainer and 1 person in charge of the logistics.\r\n\r\nThis first activity is also an important step of EPTO's new certification process. It will build upon the quality peer education programmes' development (2014) and will enable EPTO to fully launch its new certification process (2015) towards new peer trainers.\r\n\r\n-A Peer Forum : \"Peer education, a spring-board to employment' in Hollenfels (LU), aiming at advocating for the impact of peer education on youth participation and employability. Its objectives are to:\r\n-Anchor EPTO's new certification process\r\n-Link several generations of peer trainers in order to increase awareness on working possibilities in the field of peer education \r\n-Provide concrete opportunities for youth professional development\r\n-Reflect on how to indentify and value soft skills gained through peer education \r\n-Better equip and follow up peer trainers dealing with the issues of youth participation and employment at the local level.\r\n\r\nThis 4-day seminar will be attended by :\r\n- 12 youth workers, educators, facilitators, etc., certified as EPTO peer trainers in the last 3 years. We will give priority to participants from our member and partner organisations.\r\n- 8 older EPTO peer trainers, certified as EPTO peer trainers in the last 15 years.

An observation was also made that few tools exist to educate young people about this problem. A need was thus found: provide skills and tools for youth workers from different countries to enable them to educate youth about the representation of women in the music they listen to, in the music videos they watch and in the comments they post.During this training from the 1st to 11th of May 2016, 39 participants from Europe, Eastern Europe and Mediterranean (France, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Moldova, Ukraine, Morocco, Palestine, Tunisia) will have the opportunity to acquire skills (knowledge, attitude, aptitude) that will enable them to create and implement projects at a local and European level. Throughout the training course, methods of non-formal education will be used to create spaces of exchange and learning while maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect. Awareness of women's representation will also be made through discussions, round tables with local stakeholders and musicians, and through the exchange of good practices. Throughout the project, several tools will be created then re-used by the participants in their different contexts. Thus, an afternoon will be devoted to the creation of plays based on song lyrics degrading or insulting women. The plays will be presented in the evening to the local population. This will raise awareness on paying more attention to the songs they listen to and not just listen to a song because the rhythm is entertaining. At the end of the training course, several afternoons will be devoted to the creation, in sub groups, of awareness campaigns on different media (Youtube and Vine videos, poster, e-forum of discussion,campaign on social media (Facebook page and hashtag on Twitter), etc. ). Finally, a session will allow participants to develop recommendations that will then be sent to the media and elected officials to enable a better representation of women.General Objective of the Training:Build youth workers skills and give them knowledge and tools to educate youth and act against the negative portrayal of women in the music they listen to, in the clips they watch, and in the comments they post (reflecting the negative image that some young people can have on women). Indeed, these songs can have an impact on young people's vision of the male/female equality, their image and relationship towards women, and can also have a strong negative impact on young girls, their independence and personal empowerment.Specific Objectives:- Raise awareness of les experiences youth workers, about the impact of negative representations of women in the music and media on gender equality and learning to decode and break stereotypes faced by young women- To stimulate the understanding, analysis of the realities experienced by the participants and the sharing of experiences and good practices against discrimination in their Euromed context in relation to the representation of women in the media and especially in the artistic representation- Provide the participants and their organizations with attitudes, skills, knowledge and tools to improve the quality of youth work and non-formal education promoting the fight against discrimination and gender stereotypes- Create a multilingual e-campaign as a tool to fight against negative portrayals of women and stereotypes in the contexts of the participants at local, national, European and international levels.- Develop new projects with concrete and multiplier impact and write recommendations for a positive representation of women, ensuring maximum dissemination with young, youth organization, media, politicians, authorities, public, ranging from local to European levels", "http://www.ashacentre.org", null, "erasmus_2015-3-FR02-KA105-010804_9"], ["0EA", "Faiths of the World: youth work and inter-religious dialogue", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 77164.0, "\u2018Faiths of the World\u2019 is an ASHA Centre Erasmus+ Key Action 1 training programme for youth workers and youth leaders.

Life coaching as a concept focuses on personal development (both physical and mental; ranging from personal achievements to healthy food and healthy lifestyle). This project will address these issues through non-formal education. Our key target group are those working with and for young people, and their harmonious development, both in terms of maximising their potential(s) and promotion of a healthy lifestyle (more action, less video games!). \r\nWhen young people are empowered they can make change happen in their local realities.

As such, the project will promote and empower participants with new competencies focusing on active participation. We see our communities as a wide spectrum of people of different levels of education, experience, and age. This is why we propose an innovative approach to community development, focusing on three different pillars. The first one (first training) will focus on intergenerational dialogue and learning. Too often people representing different age groups do not work together for the benefit of the local community. We want to address this issue head-on by educating participants on intergenerational learning. The second course will focus on art. Art (whether it is theatre, or painting) is one of the most effective tools of active participation of everyone. We will promote the use of various art methodologies as tools for community development. The final element (third course) will address the issue of sustainable living, and will focus on social ecology. Social ecology is a result of interplay of various social, environmental and economic variables. We will focus on what is at the centre of social ecology \u2013 the social aspect of sustainability and living in harmony with the environment (including the nature). \r\n\r\nAll together, three courses (intergenerational dialogue, arts, social ecology) will form a framework offering an innovative educational experience aimed at the empowerment and development of our communities.

We will aim at organisations working in both big and small cities and communities, in order to increase the level of mutual learning. \r\nThe methods will be based on non-formal and experiential learning. We will use a combination of theatre, active participation, leadership, entrepreneurship-based and education for sustainable development methods throughout the course.

There are many questions and issues for a debate...  Youth organisations involved in this project implement majority of their activities through non-formal education and often face a difficulty to ensure sustainable, systematic and high quality education of their staff. Therefore, this project is developed in order to educate trainers with different levels of experience, provide them with an opportunity of professional development and space to contribute to quality of youth work in Europe.  To achieve this goal, we have set the following objectives: - To provide training opportunities for future trainers, trainers with limited experience and trainers with significant experience which will contribute to quality of training delivery in Europe; - To empower involved organisations to implement local and international non-formal education activities and ensure sustainable education of their staff and volunteers; - To contribute to quality of non-formal education projects in Europe, quality of trainers\u2019 work, recognition of non-formal education and create new approaches in non-formal education; - To create network of training providers in Europe and ensure communication and cooperation for exchange of good practices and improvement of quality of their work; - To establish partnership among involved organisation and share examples of cooperation with other organisations in Europe active in the field of youth.

Young people have thus seen an increase in the time required for access to the first job. This is particularly striking for overseas territories, most of which are island territories where labor markets are narrow open to new entrants. Each year, these markets are characterized by more youth entrants than the number of jobs offered. Thus, the economic dynamics specific to each ultramarine territory fail to absorb the surplus labor coming into the labor market. Moreover, the local and national policies and initiatives implemented today to support the integration of young people into the labor markets do not make it possible to sufficiently anticipate the needs on the territories.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the situation of young people \"not in education, nor in training, neither unemployed nor in employment\" is worsening among young people facing difficulties in entering the labor market. These young people often carry on short-term jobs with periods of unemployment or simply do not find work and end up resigning themselves to inactivity, considering that their chance of finding a job is almost nil. These difficulties are particularly frequent among those who have left the education system on academic failure and without obtaining a diploma. For these young people, a return to training is often difficult and often requires the use of innovative and non-formal teaching methods.\r\n\r\nIn this context, we believe that training opportunities through non-formal education and educational mobility, offered by the Erasmus Plus program but little exploited by professionals and especially ultramarine youth, constitute a real antidote for, on the other hand,  enable young people in difficulty to improve their training and thus increase their chances of entering the labor market.\r\n\r\n==> General objective\r\nThe general objective of this partnership building activity is to develop networks of organizations and to create new partnerships in order to set up projects at European level and within the framework of the Erasmus + program allowing inclusion and employability Of Young People With Fewer Opportunities.\r\n\r\n==> Specific objectives\r\n- Provide tools for participating organizations and youth workers and develop their skills, attitudes and knowledge in the field of inclusion through vocationaleducational  training and mobility, while taking into account the European dimension and the Local contexts ; \r\n-Develop and strengthen partnerships and networks by creating new international and multiplier projects between organizations working with the same target group.\r\n- Understand and share the situations, challenges and challenges faced by young people in the local context of the partners;\r\n- Visit and meet local associations working for the inclusion and employability of the youth with fewer opportunities.\r\n===> The project falls within the overall objectives of the program:\r\n- Strengthen the sharing and exchange of good practices among professionals (leaders, social workers and associations) on the support and employability of the JAMOs;\r\n- Improve the level of key skills and capacities, such as the spirit of initiatives of disadvantaged young people (resident in ZUS, NEET, under legal guardianship ...);\r\n-Promote participation in democratic life in Europe (especially in its ultra-peripheral regions) and on the labor market through social integration and the acquisition of new skills;\r\n- To promote the improvement of the quality of socio-educational activities, in particular by strengthening cooperation between organizations involved in the youth sector;\r\n- Strengthen the international dimension of projects, in particular by promoting mobility and exchanging good practices.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR02-KA105-012718_13"], ["0EA", "Creativity Tools for Youth Work", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 113720.0, "This is KA1 project devoted to the development and promotion of creativity\u2013based tools and methodology in youth work.

By participating in EVS they will gain a better understanding of other cultures as well as of their own and will inspire others across Europe to celebrate differences rather than incriminate them. \r\n\r\nIndeed, in having France and Germany representing the West, Romania and Greece for the East, Estonia for the North, Spain for the South and Slovenia and Czech Republic for the centre of Europe, we believe we have a good representation of the map of Europe. But beyond geography, other geopolitical dynamics seemed important to us, like having France and Germany together as a strong decision making axis of the European Union and as a crucial furthering of their peace and reconciliation process, or Greece whose partaking in the EU has been severely questioned in the recent history, not to mentionSpain, now in a very difficult financial state which has left its youth with very little opportunities. With this EVS, we therefore want to represent an equitably European EVS project that embraces its difficulties and celebrates its strengths in order to create more harmony and optimism in the EU. \r\n\r\nThe ASHA Centre has successfully implemented a range of international activities fostering peace and intercultural dialogue. We regularly host local and international groups for different projects promoting the exchange of ideas, harmony and coexistence. We regularly host short-term activities (Leadership Courses, Seminars, Interfaith Retreats and Youth Exchanges, Open Days amongst other) as well as international projects involving individuals from Israel, Palestine, South Africa and India. We are also hosting local and international volunteers working on sustainable development, biodynamic gardening, interreligious dialogue, non-formal education and arts and culture projects. We have excellent local partnerships with several local charities and educational centres. Many of our European participants have been inspired by our EVS volunteers. At ASHA the volunteers are a valued part of the team and become the best example of the youth work we do at the Centre and are a true example of youth empowerment and expression of happiness.\r\n\r\nThe EVS volunteers will support the general running of the centre which includes activities ranging from biodynamic gardening, to hospitality, catering and facilitating diverse international residential groups, developing community actions as well as making space for personal and social development, well-being and wholesomeness \u2013 all in an innovative and fun-packed, on-going non-formal educational programme aimed at fostering active youth participation and a sense of European citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide the volunteers with enhanced confidence and self-esteem, and examples of their work which can be used as portfolio for either further education applications or for employment interviews, and both hard and soft life skills. During their placement at ASHA the volunteers will have had experience of intercultural learning, teamwork, project design, management and implementation, working with sustainable biodynamic gardening and theatre productions. Its learning outcomes include an increased understanding of sustainable living, team building, leadership, customer service and hospitality skills, facilitation skills and active youth work.\r\n\r\nThe EVS volunteers will work with adults and young people with a wide range of abilities and from a wide range of cultures. The ASHA Centre is a unique venue to host all types of groups and events, especially trainings to empower young people. The ASHA Centre will share information about the project during organisational fairs and other charity/NGO gatherings aimed at exchange of good practice and expertise. \r\n\r\nPlease, visit our website http://www.ashacentre.org for more details about our current work and visit our facebook page https://www.facebook.com/AshaCentre/", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035909_coordinator"], ["0EA", "Faith in the Future: Inter-religious Dialogue, Youth Work and the Future of Europe", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 100940.0, "This project seeks positively to address the growing nationalism, racism and sense of disaffection across Europe, through the corrective viewpoint of inter-religious understanding. \r\nIt is based on two simple ideas:\r\n1.     The peoples of the world can learn a lot from each other\u2019s philosophical and religious traditions \r\n2.     We are stronger together \r\n \r\nThe importance in our modern European society of intercultural dialogue is perennial. Due to its inherent diversity, and migration from outside the continent, Europe today is a melting pot of cultures, faiths, languages and peoples. Today the need for understanding and connection is even more pressing given the worrying rise in nationalism, racism, economic instability and sense of disaffection across Europe. \r\n\r\nInter-religious understanding is a key challenge within the context of this diversity. Religion has been a powerful and enduring force in all societies at nearly all times. A culture\u2019s religion and philosophical thought encapsulates its people\u2019s values and ideas, sets forward their role models and is integrally related to a sense of identity for many. If we want to understand our fellow Europeans and neighbouring cultures, we must understand each other\u2019s religions. Ignorance of other\u2019s traditions is a key factor in rising xenophobia, nationalism and hostility to refugees. \r\n \r\nIn studying religions one is also learning about how people reflect on and react to what they consider to be of ultimate significance and value. Learning about the approaches of different religions to such questions, and, in so doing, studying multiple perspectives, is also therefore a profound way to reflect on them on the individual level. The benefit of doing so is that we broaden our thinking, resist superficiality, deepen our responses to life\u2019s challenges, and provide a corrective to commercial forces that, if unchecked in our lives, tend to diminish our imaginative, spiritual and intellectual potential. \r\n \r\nTo do justice to the potential depth of the topic, this project will therefore seek to present a diversity of world faiths, consisting of three-week long training activities on the following topics:\r\n 1. Islam (October 2017 course)\r\n2.  Indian Religions (December 2017 course)\r\n3.  Chinese Religions (February 2018 course) \r\n \r\nThis project seeks to go beyond a more common kind of interfaith dialogue which often focuses on the so called \u2018Abrahamic\u2019 faiths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. This is often to the detriment of religions originating in other parts of the world, which, in terms of population, antiquity, historical influence and cultural richness are just as important. These religions include Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, Bahaism, Taoism and Confucianism.\r\n \r\nThe training activities will each focus on three main areas:\r\n \r\n1.     An introduction to the \u2018basics\u2019 i.e. the origins and main beliefs and philosophy of the religious traditions in question\r\n2.     Ideas within in each culture particularly relevant to European Youth Work (e.g. leadership, political engagement and environmental sustainability)\r\n3.     Interfaith Dialogue in general, its aims, techniques, tools and how to do it in one\u2019s own context\r\n\r\nLong-term project outcomes include enhanced interfaith youth work co-operation, exchange of expertise and good practice between youth workers and increased number and quality of projects dealing with religion and religious issues.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036971_coordinator"], ["0EA", "Europe's Refugee Crisis and the Role of Youth", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 31545.0, "This is an innovative Erasmus+ Youth project developed to address the need for a youth work response to the refugee and migration crisis in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s main activity, a residential training course for youth workers, aims to develop youth worker competences and enhance youth involvement for a positive resolution to the refugee crisis, mainly using the International Organisation for Migration\u2019s #MigrantsContribute campaign and the IOM/UNHCR Not Just Numbers Manual. \r\n\r\nSince our inception, the ASHA Centre has sought to create a special space where we can contribute to the fostering of a \u2018truly global human community.\u2019 To this end we seek to: \r\n\u2022 Learn to respect and work with other people\u2019s perspectives, \r\n\u2022 Be part of an interconnected and interdependent world, \r\n\u2022 Discover the richness of other countries, cultures and faiths, \r\n\u2022 Make human connections across social and cultural divides, \r\n\u2022 Transform past prejudices and cultural biases and \r\n\u2022 Live harmoniously in an environment of diversity and change. \r\n\r\nThe project is a direct reflection of the interests and needs of young people in partner countries and organisations across European countries affected by the refugee crisis. \r\n\r\nOver the last four years the Middle East and Europe have been affected by wars, revolutions, armed conflict and tensions between societies and communities. Youth workers in all countries need to work jointly to respond to the new challenges in a spirit of dialogue and co-operation. The #MigrantsContribute campaign and IOM Not Just Numbers Manual (developed with UNHCR) provide a good platform for this. \r\n \r\nThe course will be held at the ASHA Centre, a centre of excellence in intercultural dialogue and international youth work, located in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, in November 2017. \r\n\r\nThe course will bring together 35 participants from organisations in seven countries. All participants will be selected by partner organisations on the basis of their experience and motivation to engage in migration and refugee issues through youth work. \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s overall educational objective is to develop participants\u2019 youth work competences.

Increasing mental health problems among young people\r\nB. The difficulty of working with young people with mental health problems, faced by youth workers.\r\nAddressing these issues is part of Dreams for Life's long-term strategy (for the next 3 years).\r\n\r\nThe central problem of the project we will address is: The approach, methods and educational tools used by youth workers have a limited contribution to the professional (the insertion on the labor market) and personal development of the disadvantaged young people, especially those with mental health problems. This problem limits the professional life of the youth with mental health problems and often keeps them away from the labor market, being unemployed.\r\n\r\nFrom this central problem we have created the project aim: To increase the professional capacity to work with young people for 21 youth workers from 6 countries, to contribute more effectively to the professional and personal development of young people with reduced opportunities in general and of young people with mental health problems in particular, in order to stimulate their success on the labor market.\r\n\r\nProject objectives:\r\n1. Increasing the understanding of the social, psychological and economic characteristics of young people with low opportunities, especially those with mental health problems, for 21 youth workers, during the project period.\r\n2. Developing the professional capacity (knowledge, abilities and attitudes) to work with young people with reduced opportunities, especially with young people with mental health problems, for 21 youth workers, during the project period.\r\n3. Increasing the level of understanding and achievement of the professional insertion of young people with low opportunities, especially of young people with mental health problems, for 21 youth workers, during the project period.\r\n4. Increasing the motivation to work with young people with fewer opportunities, especially with young people with mental health problems, of 21 youth workers, during the project period.\r\n\r\nWithin this project we have two categories of participants: 21 participants and 4 trainers.\r\nParticipants must have at least one of the following roles: youth leader, mentor, coach, group/individual counselor, trainer, youth project coordinator, NGO volunteer, non-formal education facilitator. These are the standard roles normally fulfilled by professional youth workers from partner countries.\r\n\r\nThe main activity consists of a training course that will begin on 15.04.2018 and will end on 22.04.2018. The course will take place at Maguri Racatau, in Cluj County. During the follow-up phase, numerous dissemination events (conferences, workshops, etc.) will be organized.\r\n\r\nThe course is based on an educational methodology based on the principles of non-formal education, holistic and ecocentric development, within the scope of young people's employability and work with disadvantaged people (especially those with mental health problems). We will use numerous participatory methods such as: icebreakers, name games and get to know each other games, teamwork and cooperation activities, debates, brainstorming, Carousel method, Aquarium, simulations, activities in nature (hiking, nature observation, tracking etc.), dance and movement, mindfulness exercises, team and individual work, coaching, mentoring, counseling, facilitation, the art of questions and active listening, etc. A series of innovative theories will be presented: Social Learning Theory, Multiple Intelligence, Self-efficacy, etc. Knowledge and skills will be put into practice by facilitating practical workshops. Joint projects, action plans, etc. will be developed.

It will be made up of three, nine-day courses to take place at The ASHA Centre, UK - led by the Centre\u2019s in-house team of theatre-professionals. Its essential premise is that theatre is an effective method for supporting social cohesion and that - by empowering a new generation of youth workers with theatre-based tools and techniques - a real contribution to peace can be achieved. \r\n\r\nThe project is a partnership between UGiN Nova Gradiska (Croatia), Seiklejate Vennaskond (Estonia), YouthFully Yours (Greece), Vulcanicamente (Italy), CET platforma Skopje (Macedonia), Asociatia Hair Redivivus (Romania), TDM2000 Polska (Poland) and ASHA (UK). \r\n\r\nThe ASHA Centre has an strong track-record of work in this field. It has previously delivered a number of drama-based peace projects, one of which, \"Acting it Out,\" received an 'Outstanding Project' award from the European Commission, and which generally have received international recognition. This has included praise from Nelson Mandela who enjoyed a performance of an ASHA production with South African young people at his home. It\u2019s production of Arabian Nights with young Jews and Arabs from northern Israel was described as \u201cthe greatest grass-roots contribution to peace in the region for decades\u201d \u2013 and directly led to a powerful transformation in the lives of its participants. \r\n \r\nThe project\u2019s three component courses will have a similar structure and some elements in common. They will all involve a creative investigation of the causes of conflict and their resolution, leading to a public presentation of scenes from Shakespeare. They will all engage participants in drama-based activities, through which they will learn tools and techniques of theatre as well as develop greater confidence in speech and movement. In other ways, the courses will be very different. The first will focus on cycles of violence, the second on radicalisation, the third on gender based conflict. Different supporting methodologies will be brought forward in each case, ranging from Theatre of the Oppressed to the Hero\u2019s Journey to Non-Violent Communication. \r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal of the project is to empower youth workers to carry out peace-projects in their home countries and, to this end, we will support participants to conceive and develop their ideas for action.  As a learning experience we will help participants develop: heightened powers of empathy, a stronger sense of responsible citizenship, greater confidence and will to lead. We will facilitate a deeper understanding of the dynamics of conflict and how they can be creatively addressed. We will support a stronger  commitment to the vision and values that underpin the European mission. \r\n\r\nIt total, we expect around 96 people to directly engage with the project as participants. We expect a further 650 people to participate indirectly by attending one of the public performance or dissemination events. Our hope is that each one of those individuals will receive a seed of inspiration for future activities and that the multiplying effect of this will amount to something genuinely substantial in the field of peace-work. Our dissemination activities will include daily Facebook updates, an online short film, public performances and promotion at future European seminars. We are keen to promote awareness of both the project itself and the principles that underlie it.   \r\n\r\nWe have conceived the project in response to requests from other organisations and our own observation that peace is best achieved through creative means that engage people in shared, artistic activity. Its content is structured in accordance with a three-fold picture of the human being, in which people are seen as having faculties of thinking, feeling and willing \u2013 which need to be addressed in balance.

We are stronger together\r\n\r\nThe populist backlash against both the so called European Refugee \u2018Crisis\u2019 and immigration in general, has been one of the most disturbing challenges to principles of European progress and unity in recent times.\r\nTo do justice to the potential depth of the topic, this project will therefore seek to present a diversity of world faiths, consisting of three-week long training activities on the following topics:\r\n1. Islam (October 2018)\r\n2. Indian Religions (February 2019)\r\n3. Chinese Religions (April 2019)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs well as looking at the philosophical foundations and historical origins of these traditions, this project will also focus on the ideas within these different traditions that are most relevant to the needs of youth workers, for example the nature of true leadership, effective action in the world, how to foster social harmony and productive political systems, and how as a society we can create a sustainable relationship to the natural world.\r\n\r\nFinally each course will include a look at the tools and techniques of good interfaith dialogue. ASHA will draw on its years of expertise in this area, to ensure that each participant is fully equipped to make a positive impact in their own community and within their own organisation.", "http://www.ashacentre.org", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", "erasmus_2018-2-UK01-KA105-048471_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0EA", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 49951.0, "Promoting non-discrimination and equality (33.02.02)", "fts_2017_28038", 2017], ["0EA", "THE ASHA FOUNDATION", 18018.0, "Eastern Partnership \u2014 Poverty reduction and sustainable development (22.04.02.02)", "fts_2017_45289", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL17"}
