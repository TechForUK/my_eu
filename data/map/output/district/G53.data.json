In this situation the young people between 18 and 25 years old, with less experience, with fewer opportunities, with an individual identity less marked and developed, and a future without certainty and stability, feel themselves \"nomads\" , always in search of new references. While remaining strong the inexorable trend toward cultural uniformity through the overall process of \"westernization\", several elements of varieties and distinction between the groups are still alive and active. They often emphasize reactions of fundamentalism, racism and self-closing where a young weak and disoriented can easily fall. In this way, the pluralism and diversity of traditions, customs and languages, which in themselves constitute grounds for mutual enrichment and development, may lead to an aggravation of the identities that gives rise to clashes and conflicts. In this current situation, young people need, therefore, to open to new experiences that lead to the knowledge of new forms of integration and dialogue and that allow, on one hand the maintenance and establishment of its own cultural identity and, on the other hand, the recognition of multiple cultural expressions for the development of  mutual respect of their peculiarities. The overall objective of the project \u201cTuMiAmi\u201d is bring 20 young people (between 18 and 25 years and from 4 different countries) to reflect on the concepts of identity, culture and intercultural that starts from the reflection on the self (identity),\r\npasses through the knowledge of the others (cultures) and finally arrives to investigate the interaction between peoples and cultures (intercultural). The participant will be able also to gain greater awareness of the competences, skills and knowledge that they really acquired and developed during the project. Through a combination of rational and well-planned activities based on non-formal learning and on learning by doing that stimulate the peer education, the young participants will be guided to acquire technic-organizational skills, attitudes and competences which will aim at self-knowledge, personal development, strengthening their self-esteem, increase the sense of initiative and active participation, acceptance and understanding of cultural relativism and of new forms of integration. In order to ensure the achievement of the objectives and results described above, the project \"TuMiAmi\" will provide a steady communication between the participating organizations, an Advanced Planning Visit in Serbia to train the future team leaders and some pre-departure meetings between the participants from the same country. Following these preparatory stages,  a youth exchange will take place in Palermo between 25 September and 9 October 2015, that will be the core of the whole project. During the first eight days, exercises and games (simulations, role play, group activities, discussions, debates, evaluations etc ..) will be proposed by a facilitator. They will enable participants to test themselves and to participate in an active and dynamic way by preventing the occurrence of passive moments. From the ninth day on, the activities will be more practical and will try to stimulate creativity and manual skills of the participants. Indeed they will be challenged in the preparation and organization of the intercultural festival \"TuMiAmi\" and the Final Gran Gala. The young participants will create cultural itineraries on topics related to tangible elements of each culture by devising ways and strategies to make them interact to each other. In this phase will be fundamental the contribution of young people belonging to the foreign communities of Palermo. The design of the itineraries will be considered the key point of what the participants will learn during the first eight days of the exchange. They will later be collected in the final output of the project: the \"Travel Diary\". Participants will be also able to get in touch with the local community and foreign communities, by producing a mutual impact which will turn out to be positive and purposeful for both parties. In addition, the participation during the festival of public and private institutions, civil society organizations, international bodies, national and local television broadcasters and the organization of multiplier events after the exchange will ensure that the benefits of the project related to the dissemination and sharing of democratic values such as tolerance and non-discrimination, the sense of active citizenship and the thrust towards youth initiatives and policies, will produce a long-term impact both nationally and internationally.", "http://www.myccg.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-IT03-KA105-006323_6"], ["7SZ", "Europe My Way", "Crookston Community Group", 9756.0, "EUROPE MY WAY \u00e8 un scambio interculturale, , che nasce dalle esigenze e bisogni di alcuni ragazzi e ragazze dell'Istituto Midossi di Civita Castellana che, giunti alla fine del loro percorso scolastico, sono in procinto di prendere decisioni importanti nella loro vita riguardanti il loro futuro professionale e umano.

Through narratives, we raise the consciousness of people in a disadvantaged position in society.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand storytelling enables us to make a closer connection to the everyday life and troubles of individuals which sets the agenda for collective action.

All organizations are primary schools with the exception of Bulgaria, which is kindergarten. Poland, which belongs to the School Complex is going to have in their composition kindergarten in September 2015. Our actions are going to be based primarily on the exchange of experiences in order to provide the highest level of education. The first crucial action is going to be an introducing with partners by organization of thematic days in each school. Every school for one day will change the decoration, including the possibility of preparing some special clothes by the students and teachers. From the beginning, we will take care of the effective promotion of our activities by maintaining websites and newsletters in the school which will cover current events. We are going to conduct regular correspondence between our students by the form of traditional letters, e-mails and video calls over by the Internet.  We would like to arrange six meetings with partner countries to be able to get to know our schools, to see how the lessons look like in practice and to inspire from the solutions applied in the functioning of the school. From experience from previous projects we know that such visits provide many ideas which are implemented later. \r\nOne of the main effects of our actions will be creating a teaching guide describing the methods of working with fairy tales during the lessons. We want to compile a book with a collection of fairy tales from our countries, as well as a publication with some stories created by ourselves. The great attraction for younger children will be exchanging a puppet  and experiencing various adventures. We\u2019re going to prepare some performances based on chosen fairy tales. We want to raise our skills by organise training course with therapy by fairy tales prepared by ourselves. The topic of fairy tales will be an opportunity for us to organization numerous art competitions, for the preparation of games and to set up their reading marathons. The final popularized event will be  a Fairytale Festival, which will provide plenty of activities and the presentation of the results of our work for the local community. \r\nWe are confident that thanks to our project the topic of  fairy tales will  remain for the long time in our schools. This will happen through the creation of teaching guide, as well as many other publications and multimedia supports and the products of children\u2019s works. The completed actions will activate  the sphere of student\u2019s family , as well as the local community.
