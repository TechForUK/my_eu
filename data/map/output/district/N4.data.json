However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 36705.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_937778153"], ["3JU", "Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application", "Outlandish Llp", "SMEs and public sector organizations increasingly investigate the possibilities to use cloud computing services in their everyday business conduct. Accessing services and resources in the cloud on-demand and in a flexible and elastic way could result in significant cost savings due to more efficient and convenient resource utilization that also replaces large investment costs with long term operational costs. On the other hand, the take up of cloud computing by SMEs and the public sector is still relatively low due to limited application-level flexibility and also security concerns. The Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application (COLA) project aims to increase the adoption of cloud computing services by the above mentioned two strategic target communities. Typical industry and public sector applications require resource scalability and efficient resource utilization in order to serve a variable number of customers with dynamic resource demands, and to suitably optimize resource consumption and costs. However, the dynamic and intelligent utilization of cloud infrastructure resources from the perspective of cloud applications is not trivial. Although there have been several efforts to support the intelligent and coordinated deployment, and to a smaller extent also the run-time orchestration of cloud applications, no comprehensive solution has emerged until now that could be applied in large scale near operational level industry trials. The overall objective of the COLA project is that by building on and extending current research results, it will define and provide a reference implementation of a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications. COLA will demonstrate the applicability and impact of the solution via large scale near operational level SME and public sector pilots and demonstrators, and will also define a clear pathway how the innovation can be delivered to the market.", 172691.0, 3658885.0, "COLA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206078_937778153"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3JG", "Film London Production Finance Market 2015", "FILM LONDON", 72614.0, "The Production Finance Market (PFM) is an International FILM FINANCE MARKET bringing together European / International Film Producers and Financiers with a focus on feature film project financing.

As a result of deep analysis and assessment of education policy efficiency kept by the community  authorities and made by the experts of Certification Commission (in the Local Government Leadership Education programme) some conclusions were reached. Moreover, the needs of educational stuff in terms of teacher training and improving quality of education in G\u00f3rno Community were worked out. Consequently, a long-term European Programme of Schools Development  in G\u00f3rno Community has been created. Now it is essential to take specific action in order to achieve its aims. Our project and its goals are the consequence of  European Programme of Schools Development in G\u00f3rno Community which was formed in association with those who are involved in the process of  local education policy creation: teachers, head teachers, local authorities responsible for  the education sector in G\u00f3rno Community and after consultations with  the representatives of student organizations.\r\nWe realize that such issues as language competences and new information and communication technologies are becoming dominant in contemporary education and taking into consideration the educational needs of schools in the area of G\u00f3rno Community we have decided to start cooperation with some foreign partners in Erasmus + programme. The representatives of JST (as the body governing schools), head teachers and teachers of all schools from G\u00f3rno Community (from nursery to lower secondary school) - 44 people in total.\r\nAims of the project - to improve skills in terms of:\r\n- efficient and creative use of ICT in the process of developing students' key competences,\r\n- shaping of citizenship attitudes focused on entrepreneurship,\r\n- bilingual  education (CLIL) in order to increase practical language skills of students,\r\n- identifying  the needs and chances of community and schools development which may be fulfilled  in cooperation with the foreign partners.\r\nBilingual schools have been existing in Poland for over 15 years, in Europe - for much longer. According to recommendations of European Commission everyone should be able to speak at least two European languages (apart from first language). In Poland there are more than 100 bilingual schools. On the other hand, in \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship - there is none. Some of schools from the area of G\u00f3rno Community are taking part in realization of the pilot project called \"School Incubators of Bilingualism\" which involves, inter alia, attending job shadowing  in Polish schools which use the CLIL method.\r\nIn  the project \u201cCreative Teacher - Creative Student - searching for new solutions in education\u201d  the educational consortium of G\u00f3rno Community has got three foreign partners: the Istituto Comprensivo \u201cFalcone e Borsellino\u201d from Italy,  Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Secundaria \u201cCastillo del \u00c1guila\u201d from Spain and Skinners\u2019 Academy from Great Britain.\r\nThe Italian and Spanish schools specialize in bilingual education (Italian and Spanish educational systems introduced bilingualism at schools some years ago by ministerial reforms) as well as use of information technology in teaching and learning process. The British school is famous for efficient activities that make students motivated to gain knowledge and skills, social activity and entrepreneurship, professional  educational and vocational guidance and a wide range of ICT devices used in education.\r\nEntrepreneurship, ICT and first of all knowledge of foreign language automatically make a young man more attractive  from employment opportunities point of view, broaden his horizons and make us more open-minded. Ludwig Wittgenstein said: \"The limits of my language means the limits of my world.\" Bilingual education gives people an opportunity to go beyond of what the German philosopher stated: when we learn a foreign language, also in this language we are introduced with new points of view and new perspectives. We are strongly convinced that our actions will let the young generation from our community develop and function properly in the future.\r\nTaking part in the project and job shadowing training - learning from Spanish, Italian and British educational experiences and solutions in terms of bilingual teaching and use of ICT in the process of teaching key competences - is going to let us gain our goals - to influence  the quality improvement of our schools as well as give opportunity for international cooperation. \r\nOur intention is to continue these activities which are focused on setting up bilingual groups in schools of G\u00f3rno Community.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter where you're coming from; all that matters is where you are going.\"\r\nBrian Tracy", "http://www.skinnersacademy.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA101-015829_2"], ["1DH", "Water Liquid of Life", "OTI YOUTH LTD", 17198.0, "Water, the Liquid of life is one of our natural resources that we cannot live without.

We will test our knowledge about each other as people and as countries and understand the importance of cultural diversity and understanding in our growth.  We will test our knowledge on world facts and understand where we stand as Europeans in the world and how we play a vital role in the world today. \r\nIn addition to the above the sports aspect will also promote a healthy lifestyle amongst the youth.\r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.

They identified that as youth they don\u2019t have much say in what is happening in policy and especially those from small countries who feel that as a country they have no say in the policies of the EU.  Not only do young people of these countries feel powerless when it comes to their lives are affected by different policies but the crisis in the EU has affected their employment options and again they feel there is no solution for the problems, at least not from their hands. \r\n\r\nThe project will identify specific problems related to youth in the partner countries and will look at methods to overcome these problems in a uniform way that can be used across the EU.  We will look at different solutions for problems like youth unemployment, education and methods to enhance skills and help young people become more employable and at the same time allow young people to be more active in their community and in the EU.\r\n\r\nEach partner in the project will identify problems specific to their country and also work on solutions in helping young people and also in finding methods to bring the EU closer together to work together to be more unified to build a stronger more unified EU.  We have also included Turkey in the project to give us an added element to the project as a candidate country to the EU allowing us to see the perspectives of young people outside of the EU and perhaps learning from their methods and also promoting the EU model to them.  \r\n\r\nOnce all the information is collected the groups of young people will get together for the project activity to discuss all the issues in detail and work on solutions for these problems.\r\n\r\nThere is a global crisis going on and the EU is equally affected by this crisis.  Sadly though many young people from different countries are feeling the effects of the crisis and many are beginning to lose hope in the EU system because they feel that they are excluded from the EU support system.  Young people are unable to find employment, and mobility options are growing less and less and young people are losing hope in a unified Europe.  \r\nOur project will look at the crisis and the problems that young people are experiencing, we will look at the various tools the EU offers youth to overcome these difficult times.  Has the common currency benefitted us or is there a problem with the Eurozone?  Is it really the right choice for all of us?

We will look at the negative impact of social media, especially with regard to how it affects chances of employment and give the tools to youth workers and organisations to help youth in each of the communities to take advantage of social media.  We will also develop strategies to turn social media into more of a learning experience rather than a platform to waste time.  Our hope is to be able to take social media, a tool enjoyed by all youth, and turn it into a platform which will allow them to learn and also create jobs, find jobs and even develop business skills.\r\nThe objective of the project is to help youth workers help young people to turn social media and technology into a tool which can help them find employment, promote themselves, their ideas, even their business ideas, and also to enhance and enrich their skills and knowledge.  To help overcome common problems seen regarding the incorrect and irresponsible usage of social media and allow young people to understand the risks and dangers and at the same time reap the benefits of such technology for their benefit.\r\nWe will explore the different types of social media and see how we can use each of these for the benefit of young people and especially to help them increase their employability.  \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops.

This perception is built upon the knowledge of what the economical, social and democratic situation is Europe in today. Also perception derives from the personal logic and experiences of the young today. This is because many youngsters leave school either by their choice or not.

The participants will exchange good and bad practices from their countries and we will explore all the opportunities available for youth in the EU and on national levels to help them maximise their skills and increase their employability.  The partners of this project have worked together to develop this project as we have identified two main concerns in most of the partner countries, namely that young people are unaware of how and where to look for employment and secondly don\u2019t realise the skills that they have and often underestimate their capabilities.  With this project we hope to allow young people to understand their potential and give them the confidence to understand and acknowledge their skills and competences and give them the tools to be able to explore more employment opportunities so that they know where to find employment.We will look at the advantages of the freedom of mobility that we all have as EU citizen but will shed light on the difficulties that might be encountered allowing the young people to make more informed choices when considering mobility as an option.We will promote enlargement and sustainability in our home countries and in the EU but helping young people to first explore all their options in their home country before considering moving abroad.  A very important element that we will need to address in the project is information, access to information and how young people find information.  Why do young people not find information (about employment or opportunities) when we live in an age when information is at our fingertips?We believe that this project will give young people the needed understanding of labour market needs and of their own skills to overcome the problems of youth unemployment in their countries and in the EU.

Sadly though sports is not always accessible to all people and even those involved in sports are so competitive that some even resort to substance abuse simply to stay on top.  This youth exchange will look at sports from three perspectives; making sports accessible to everyone, keeping active to maintain a healthy lifestyle and allowing people to find employment in the field of sports.  The youth exchange is made up of young people from various areas of each of the partner countries with more emphasis on young people who don\u2019t have easy or free access to sport, and also including young people who have an interest in turning sports into a career.   Young disadvantages people will also participate in this exchange to offer their insight on the subject to allow us to examine and develop new approaching to helping more young people to access sports and also for young people to follow careers in sports.The main issues to be covered in this exchange are access to sport by young people and evaluating the quality and quantity, the support offered to young people from school levels and the continued obstacles they face as they grow up.  The second issue to be explored is the use of illegal substances in sports, evaluating why people feel the need to resort to such action and how we can overcome these problems.  We will also look at sports or physical activities from the viewpoint of healthy lifestyles.  Finally we will be looking at ways that young people can find employment in the field of sports, either by discovering gaps in the market or by creating jobs in the communities that need them.It is our hope to share good and bad practices between the partner countries and knowledge and experience and develop workable solutions to assist more young people to have equal access to sports, to allow them to incorporate at least one sporting activity into their daily lives and to be able to create jobs in the field of sports for young people.   In order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are vital, non-formal and informal methodologies are used to achieve these goals.  Discussions are used to allow participants to share knowledge, ideas and experiences with each other. Discussions will give the participants more confidence, especially when seeing that participants from other countries are facing the same problems.

However having a degree does not guarantee employment.  As a matter of fact on of the factors that create large amounts of unemployment is that fact that so many people have degrees in the same fields.  Another issue of concern is that not all universities are recognised with the same respect in different countries.  Some universities are so well known that simply having a degree from that university cold secure employment but then we realise that these universities also happen to be the most expensive thus not accessible to all.Our projects aims to look at education and the value of education, meaning the value of when we come back to our country and the value associated with the chances of finding employment with that degree or diploma.  We have seen that young people follow fashionable educational choices and we want to evaluate this to help young people make more informed choices regarding education so that they are more employable after their education.  Giving them the tools to understand the markets before they start their studies and to make more informed choices.The main issues covered during this youth exchange is youth unemployment and finding ways to prevent the unemployment problem for youth by giving them the tools to understand future markets and current markets to make more informed choices of education.

Young people are more pressured into getting degrees and qualifications in order to increase their chances of employment but there seems to be a gap in the system as universities and schools are not being updated about the market trends and as a result the employability of youth is decreasing, even though their education is increasing.  The question of the gap between these institutions or the capitalistic approach to education will be evaluated and we will explore how young people are influences to make their educational choices.The main objectives of this project are to help young people increase their employability and to help them find where to find employment and be more ready for the labour market based on the needs of the labour market thus helping in dealing with the youth unemployment problem in the EU.

We hope that with the various workshops and activities the youth will gain the knowledge and the tools for them to understand the markets better and to increase their employability.

We hope to gain real knowledge of these issues especially cross boarder employment and employment opportunities as many young people simply think that by going to another country the employment problem ends, but there are many other factors to take into account when working and living in another country.  Many young people have an attitude that there are no employment opportunities left and as a result they sit back waiting for an opportunity to come to them, and as a result we blame the system for this.

The problems identified in these projects allowed us to build this project with the hope to help more young people learn more about the European System, the European democratic system and the importance of active citizenship and active participation of youth in policy and society.We discovered that young people don\u2019t really understand how the EU works, what their place and role in the EU is or should be and what their obligations are or how they can facilitate change in their communities and in the EU.  We want to help young people understand the concept of the EU, how it works and how important their role is in the EU.  We have chosen sports as a medium to help them understand this concept better.  The EU is currently made up of 28 countries, some are major players, but the majority are minorities within the EU and sometimes feel insignificant, with a feeling that they are too weak as countries, either economically or in numbers to have any impact or effect on EU policy.  We need to show that every country regardless of how big or small, is a contributor to the EU and plays a vital role in the EU.  The objective is to allow the youth to better understand that by being active members of a society and by working together and also contributing to the growth of the EU they can be key players in the EU.  The idea is to allow all youth to feel equally important in the EU and in their countries.   The project will adopt sports as the medium to simulate the workings of the EU allowing participants to work together in international groups to utilise individual strength to make the groups stronger and also to understand weaknesses so that we can help each other be stronger as a whole.By taking this approach we will understand how the EU works and how we as youth can make a difference by working together for a greater unified EU.  Many aspects need to be analysed during the project including cultural differences, local resources and strengths of each country and also the knowledge available in each community.  We believe this project is a great way to show young people how to work together and take advantage of the different strengths of each country and person to help them work together just like the EU does.In order to achieve these goals, the activities foreseen for the project are important.

The idea is to host a youth exchange on the same subject offing the opportunity of young people from different countries who have followed the course and have had success in business to share their knowledge and experience with other young people who are interested in starting a business of their own.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this youth exchange is to target the huge problem with youth unemployment in the EU and to help young people interested in starting their own business to understand the risks and advantages of starting their own business.  By including people who have successfully opened their own business in various countries we allow for greater learning by the participants and also for possible new cooperation and opportunities for youth.  \r\n\r\nThe main issue addressed in this project is that of youth unemployment, looking at how many young people embark on the journey of their own business, we see that this is supported by the EU with programs like Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and we also see this on a local level with initiative helping young people to set up their business with financial support.  With all these opportunities available to young people we need to ensure that young people are prepared for opening their own business thus giving them the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge to do so effectively and allowing for greater chances of success.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this project could be a start in helping organisations help solve the problems with youth unemployment with youth in their countries and also help boost local economies.\r\n\r\nThe profile of the participants is vital for this project and we will select the participants best for the project but at the same time giving priority to those who are disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are important.  As the topic is significant to all the participants we anticipate that all the participants will be extremely active in the project offering as much as they can but also taking back as much as possible.  Discussions and debates will give the youth a different perspective of the problems and perhaps even new methods of addressing these problems.  \r\n\r\nWorkshops will be designed to maintain a European dimension as all groups will be made up of at least one person from each country allowing for cultural learning during the workshops. Workshops are designed around the various subjects allowing the different youth to discuss the issues and work together to solve problems and share experiences.\r\nRole playing will also be used to allow the participants to get another perspective of different problems.  This has proven to be very successful as it allows for the youth to see common problems from the viewer\u2019s point of view rather than the actor.  This also allows for innovative ways showing problems.\r\n\r\nSimulations are also done during the project, allowing people to take on roles which are opposite to their real roles.

Important here is that the participants take on random roles which add additional learning tools as they need to think and act as the person they are simulating. \r\n\r\nUsing all the above tools and methodologies the youth learn through fun activities which are real, but are within a safe environment allowing them to learn from each other, make mistakes which can be corrected through discussions and not put themselves at risk.  In real life when making these choices the results could be destructive but these activities simulate reality and allow for learning in a safe and secure environment.\r\n\r\nThey will also be able to discuss and evaluate problems with their peers and help them by giving them guidance and support when it is needed.  We hope that the information gained during this project is shared within all the communities and especially with the youth of these communities so that more youth can increase their employability in each of the partner communities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to learning about the problems the youth will also exchange cultures and traditions and learn about the different cultures from the different countries allowing for better understanding of each other and therefore creating a more unified EU, fighting xenophobia and also discrimination.", "http://www.otieducation.org", "OTI EDUCATION UK", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035043_coordinator"], ["1DH", "Entrepreneur's Manual", "OTI EDUCATION UK", 27212.0, "This project was developed by the partners of the project when seeing that a lot of emphasis is given to entrepreneurial skills and assisting young people in gained these skills and competences.

The combination of experience with young people from 12 countries, especially in identifying the common problems that young people face and the gaps in their knowledge about entrepreneurialism and also taking the experience of other organisations in the business fields the idea was created to develop a training course that would bring together  youth workers, trainers and specialist in the field of business to develop new methodologies and activities that can be used in all the partner countries and other countries to help young people develop their entrepreneurial skills and help them start their own business.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project is to identify common problems and lack in the knowledge of young people in each of the partner countries regarding business and especially starting their own business and then to develop a variety of training courses and workshops that will help young people gained the needed skills to start their own business.\r\n\r\nBy doing this we will be able to help young people in all the partner countries to gain the needed skills to start their own business and simultaneously help combat unemployment in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project will address youth unemployment and methods to help young people overcome these problems by creating their own jobs based on their skills and education allowing them to properly measure the risks of starting a business and also evaluating their ability to be self-employed.

We will see how one market influences the other, and more specifically how culture can influence the success or failure of a business.  We will see elements of active citizenship and how these affect our rights as citizens of the EU.  We will see how inclusion, or exclusion affects the chances of young people to succeed in a very demanding labour market.  We will give focus on EU tools available to young entrepreneurs to give them the push needed to start their own business or to give them the skills and competences to make the right decisions regarding their careers and their future. \r\n\r\nThe idea of the training course is to develop a manual as a final result with tips and guides on how to start a business that can be used by all young people interested in starting their own business.\r\n\r\nWe will exchange good and bad practices from each country and put all the good practices together for formulate workshops and activities so that each of the partner organisations and other organisation can help more young people in these important and desperately needed areas. \r\nVital tools will be used to learn about EU opportunities, this will include EVS, EURES, internships and placements to mention only a few.

If you ask most young people what they think of the EU, they will tell you that they can travel freely, study and work in any country, travel with an ID card.  Yet, when you ask about who controls the EU chances are you will hear answers like Germany or the 3 or 4 of the major countries of the EU.  So are they saying or feeling that the largest economic countries are also the ones controlling the EU?\r\n\r\nThe partnership believes that young people lack the understanding of the idea of the EU, being born into a system they don\u2019t truly understand, and yet too young to be able to compare the differences of life inside and outside the EU.  Are our schools not educating our youth on the meaning of the EU and the role each country plays in the EU.  Is the media affecting the understanding of what is truly happening in the EU?

What is the real idea of the EU and how do each of our countries play a role in this EU?  Looking deeply into how each of us play a role in the EU.

What rights come with being an EU citizens and how do we treat these rights?  Do we enjoy all these rights or are they simply another empty promise?  \r\n\r\nWe will look at EU enlargement and the democratic process of the EU and see how we can be more involved in the EU, making it a better place for all of us.

What happened and what will happen?  How does this affect us?  Is there a weakness in the EU?  We will examine the meaning of the common market and how this affects all of us.  So many countries want access to this common market and even the UK who voted to leave the EU, still wants access to the common market.  What is the price of being part of the common market and why is the UK voting to leaving the EU when leaving it would be a disadvantage?  We will see the relationship that Norway has with the EU, and how different this is from a normal member of the EU.  Is there an advantage to this?  Rumour has it that the UK will follow this path, what will the impact of this be on the UK and the EU?  \r\n\r\nWe will look at mobility, one the major factors, believed to give the leave vote its majority.  We will examine the Mobility Treaty and see if this has disadvantages to member states.  We will also examine how Switzerland tried to abandon the freedom of mobility treaty with the EU, which was never realised.  All of these factors have to do with democracy and how it works and how it affects us.  Is democracy failing?\r\n\r\nWe saw that the results of the UK referendum showed a very small margin of difference in the results, showing how democracy works, but also showing that democracy can leave almost half the voting population dissatisfied with the results.  We also saw how youth felt cheated by this referendum because they could not vote for such an important issue.  Is this yet another statistic showing how young people have no say in their future?\r\n\r\nAs a result of the UK referendum we also saw, in the media, that some other countries want a EU exit.  Is this propaganda or is the EU truly starting to fail?  The question boils down to how we measure success and failure.  If it was a question of economics only, the EU is a world power economically speaking.  If it\u2019s a question of influence on policy, every EU country has a say on EU policy, and even has some liberty to create specific laws for their country, education being one of these.   These are only some of the questions we will ask to try to understand why many feel that the EU is not working or failing.  Perhaps we will discover some problems that are not in the media, or perhaps the media is sharing different version of reality in different countries.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to understand the working of the EU, how it works, why it works and what role we as youth play in it and how we can change the future of our EU, so that we are truly living in a Union.      \r\n\r\n\r\nWith such a diverse partnership we will see a European impact from our project.

But how unique is our food?  If we took a traditional plate of food from every European country, how different would these plates be?  How similar would they be?  \r\n\r\nFood is an integral part of our culture but it\u2019s not the only element, and just like food other aspects of our culture, art, customs, traditions and many more, are influenced by others over time.

This project envisions two volunteers, one from United Kingdom and one from Slovenia, that are passionate about human rights and interested in LGBT* topics.

Most young people follow fashionable career paths through education without planning their future or even knowing what the future, in terms of employment, can offer them and as a result we see very high number in youth unemployment all over the world.  This is a serious concern and although a lot is done on National and European levels to combat youth unemployment, the source of the problem still lies in the choices of young people.\r\n\r\nWe will examine the factors which influence the choices young people make about their futures, the educational systems in place, trying to identify problems, and help young people understand the importance of planning for their careers based on the real needs of the labour markets.  Our aim is to build a bridge between the young people and their abilities, and then pave the roads between youth and the labour markets.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the key to success starts with understanding ourselves, who we are and what we are capable of doing.  When we can identify these key elements, we can start to work on building our careers, we can choose our education based on our skills and abilities, and combines these to meet the needs of the labour market, securing a future with employment being long term and allowing us to grow in this career rather than jumping from job to job simply to gain experience and then jump to the next.\r\n\r\nThe youth exchange will bring young people from several countries together to share their concerns and to work on finding solutions to overcome youth unemployment in all EU countries, working together to share best practices and share knowledge and ideas so that we can help all young people in the EU build careers in an attempt to combat the excessively high youth unemployment numbers in the EU.\r\n\r\nWe will explore the options in education, the options in employment, taking advantage of the freedoms of mobility, and learn to understand and even predict the labour market trends and needs so that we can make young people more employable. \r\n\r\nDiscussions are used to allow participants to share knowledge, ideas and experiences with each other.

It is as though a person without a degree has no place in the labour market.  We see young people gaining degrees but still find themselves behind a long unemployment line after they have completed their university.  We don\u2019t want to devalue a university degree, but it is really enough to secure a job?  Research and statistics have shown us that it is not enough, young people need to understand and develop their skills in order to meet the demands and needs of the labour market and this youth exchange will focus on exactly that, the development and enhancement of skills, soft skills and combine education in order to make young people more employable.  The European Commission has identified the problems with lack of skills of young people and this is one of the main priorities of Erasmus+, in order to create the opportunities for young people to increase skills and employability.      \r\n\r\nThe second focus of the project is to help young people identify the labour market, understand it, its needs and how they can play an active role in the labour market.   Most young people complain that they have what they need to be employed, and yet the labour market tells them that they don\u2019t have the experience and the skills for the job.  So, is there a problem with our education system?  Are your schools not preparing young people for the labour market?  Is it the duty of the schools to prepare us for the labour market, and if so, for which market?\r\n\r\nThe project will focus on identifying skills needed for the different jobs out there and helping young people determine just how skilled they are for the jobs they are applying for and even helping them to identify sources of employment based on their skill sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will look at the different fields of education that our young people have chosen and also look at their life skills, their soft skills, their practical skills and other skills they might have and see how we can use these skills to make them more attractive to employers and also give them a more diverse spectrum of employment opportunities.  The project will also focus on helping young people to develop and enhance these skills in order to make them more employable.\r\n\r\nThis youth exchange will focus on the different skills young have or can obtain through various methods allowing them to utilise their strength and enhance the areas of their weaknesses, to give them confidence and faith that their efforts are not lost and that even in difficult times, employment opportunities are out there for those that know how to use what they already have.  \r\n\r\nWe will explore ourselves, finding our best talents and skills allowing us to face a challenging labour market with the tools and knowledge to become an active part of the labour market and leave youth unemployment behind us, by knowing who we are and what we can do.

As a result of deep analysis and assessment of education policy efficiency kept by the community authorities and made by the experts of Certification Commission (in the Local Government Leadership Education programme) some conclusions were reached. Moreover, the needs of educational stuff in terms of teacher training and improving quality of education in G\u00f3rno Community were worked out. Consequently, a long-term European Programme of Schools Development  in G\u00f3rno Community has been amended (it is coherent with Comprehensive Programme of Schools Development in G\u00f3rno Commune for 2017-2023). Now it is essential to take specific action in order to achieve its aims. Our project and its goals are the consequence of  European Programme of Schools Development in G\u00f3rno Community which was formed in association with those who are involved in the process of  local education policy creation: teachers, head teachers, local authorities responsible for  the education sector in G\u00f3rno Community and after consultations with  the representatives of student organizations. \r\nThe European Programme of Schools Development  in G\u00f3rno Community and Comprehensive Programme of Schools Development in G\u00f3rno Commune for 2017-2023 are documents included in the aims of the strategic programmes on European, national, regional and local level. The plans are coherent and complementary with the inner documents of schools located on the area of G\u00f3rno District.\r\nWe realize that such issues as integration, inclusive education, language competences and new information and communication technologies are becoming dominant in contemporary education and taking into consideration the educational needs of schools in the area of G\u00f3rno Community we have decided to start cooperation with some foreign partners in Erasmus + programme. The participants of the project will be the representatives of the body governing schools, head teachers and teachers of all schools from G\u00f3rno Community - 53 people in total.\r\nAims of the project - to improve skills in terms of:\r\n- efficient and creative use of ICT in the process of developing students' key competences,\r\n- professional  support for disabled children and students with special educational needs, \r\n- bilingual  education (CLIL) in order to increase practical language skills of students,\r\n- identifying  the needs and chances of community and schools development which may be fulfilled  in cooperation with the foreign partners.\r\nIn  the project \u201cInnovation - Educ@tion - Inclusion - new challenges for G\u00f3rno District\u201d the educational consortium of G\u00f3rno Community has got three foreign partners: Agrupamento de Escolas Bo Agua (AEBA) w Quinta do Conde (Portugal), University Lus\u00f3fona  from Lisbon (CEIED - Center of Study for Interdisciplinary Education and Development) and Skinners\u2019 Academy from Great Britain.\r\nThe Portuguese partners specialize in bilingual education (Portuguese educational systems introduced bilingualism at schools some years ago by ministerial reforms), inclusive education as well as use of information technology in teaching and learning process. The British school is famous for efficient activities that make students motivated to gain knowledge and skills, professional  support for disabled children and students with special educational needs and a wide range of ICT devices used in education.\r\nTolerance and social inclusion, ICT and first of all knowledge of foreign language automatically make a young man more attractive  from employment opportunities point of view, broaden his horizons and make us more open-minded. Ludwig Wittgenstein said: \"The limits of my language means the limits of my world.\" Bilingual education gives people an opportunity to go beyond of what the German philosopher stated: when we learn a foreign language, also in this language we are introduced with new points of view and new perspectives. We are strongly convinced that our actions will let the young generation from our community develop and function properly in the future.\r\nTaking part in the project - job shadowing and trainings - learning from Portuguese and British educational experiences and solutions in terms of bilingual teaching, professional  support for students with special educational needs and use of ICT in the process of teaching key competences - is going to let us gain our goals - to influence  the quality improvement of our schools as well as give opportunity for international cooperation. \r\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter where you're coming from; all that matters is where you are going.\"\r\nBrian Tracy", "http://www.skinnersacademy.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PL01-KA101-049044_2"], ["1DH", "Business Basics 2", "OTI EDUCATION UK", 29095.0, "This youth exchange is a follow up of a project implemented by our organisation in 2017 and from the great success of the project we developed the project further to include all the new elements discovered to enrich the project to allow for a greater impact on youth in more countries.  This youth exchange is based on a training course offered by our organisation that helps people understand the concept of opening a business and looking at all the elements required to do so successfully.  The idea is to host a youth exchange on the same subject offing the opportunity of young people from different countries who have followed the course and have had success in business to share their knowledge and experience with other young people who are interested in starting a business of their own.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this youth exchange are to target the huge problem with youth unemployment in the EU and to help young people interested in starting their own business to understand the risks and advantages of starting their own business.  By including people who have successfully opened their own business in various countries we allow for greater learning by the participants and also for possible new cooperation and opportunities for youth.  \r\n\r\nThe main issue addressed in this project is that of youth unemployment, looking at how many young people embark on the journey of their own business, we see that this is supported by the EU with programs like Erasmus for young entrepreneurs and we also see this on a local level with initiative helping young people to set up their business with financial support.  With all these opportunities available to young people we need to ensure that young people are prepared for opening their own business thus giving them the entrepreneurial skills and knowledge to do so effectively and allowing for greater chances of success.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this project could be a start in helping organisations help solve the problems with youth unemployment with youth in their countries and also help boost local economies.\r\n\r\nThe profile of the participants is vital for this project and we will select the participants best for the project but at the same time giving priority to those who are disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the activities foreseen for the project are important.  As the topic is significant to all the participants we anticipate that all the participants will be extremely active in the project offering as much as they can but also taking back as much as possible.
