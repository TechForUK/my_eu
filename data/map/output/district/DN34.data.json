In seeking to broaden an International and EC dimension to our learning programmes by creating new EC collaboration, this project will help transform teaching and learning, work-related training and thus lead to the further improvement in outcomes for learners. The project is the first proposal (this is for staff mobility) as part of a four year transformational programme through Erasmus to improve the work-related learning and employability of students in Digital, Creative and Cultural Industries.  The creative industries, coupled with the visitor economy reflect upon society and create creative content, graphics, film, sculpture, performance and music that stimulate, enrich and entertain, as well as generate wealth and economic value within society. The arts are an international phenomenon, whereas, to the exception of excellence in arts, most training and development at a secondary/tertiary (Further Education) level is anchored within local institutions.  We therefore wish to develop a new European dimension, firstly in teacher training and curriculum design, and subsequently leading towards transnational colloborations with student mobility, touring exhibitions and improved employability for learners.", "http://www.grimsby.ac.uk", "Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-024191_coordinator"], ["5BY", "New Learners, New Methodologies", "Franklin College", 12407.0, "Our institution is a Secondary and Upper-Secondary school, located in a middle town (22000 inhabitants), close to Granada.

The Lisbon Treaty states that the EU \u201cshall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common heritage to the fore\u201d (Article 167). The creative sector will only flourish with underpinning training and skills, which \u201copen doors to personal fulfilment and development, social inclusion, active citizenship and employment\u201d (EC: A New Skills Agenda for Europe, 2016). Grimsby Institute is committed to both building upon its proud heritage of cultural industries skills training and to strengthening social mobility through education in an area of endemic multiple deprivation. With forecasts of unprecedented skills needs in digital and creative industries by 2025 (Cedefop), and unparalleled number of UK graduates working in creative industries across Europe (UKCES), we are modernising curriculum for Digital and Creative Industries, working more closely with employers and learning from European best practice in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for our students, and ultimately transform lives.\r\n \r\nCreative Traineeships for Employment (CREATE) will raise 12 BTEC Art and Media students\u2019 skills, employability, achievement and aspiration by providing them with practical experience of working abroad and exposure to European language and culture. The CREATE project is designed to provide a \u2018bite sized\u2019 3-week encounter which can be integrated within the 2-year course structure and challenges students to push personal boundaries and develop new perspectives from the baseline of their own personal experience. In Jan/Feb 2018, 6 students will be hosted by a leading VET provider in Malta (MCAST) and 6 students will be hosted by an experienced German VET provider, becoming immersed in European culture through living with host families, being introduced to some of the world\u2019s most important cultural sights and experiencing the world of work through 3-days per week placed in industry. The Maltese mobility will also provide the \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 opportunity for budding artists to experience Valletta: City of Culture 2018, and support the European creative community through volunteering placements facilitated by MCAST. CREATE will help students to develop the transversal skills that are crucial to \u201cfacilitating the transition into employment maintaining the workforce\u201d (EC: A New Skills Agenda for Europe, 2016). CREATE stands for:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Confidence - self-motivation and ability to generate self-belief in personal capabilities\r\n\u2022 Resilience - the ability to adjust to pressure and adapt to changes in circumstances.\r\n\u2022 Explore and solve problems - the ability to research and select information, think creatively and generate solutions. \r\n\u2022 Autonomy and initiative - the ability to evaluate and calculate risks and identify options for successful outcomes. \r\n\u2022 Teamwork - the ability to collaborate, share knowledge and build team engagement in order to achieve a common goal. \r\n\u2022 Establish, organise, plan - the ability to prioritise, manage timelines, and coordinate tasks.\r\n\r\nCREATE will also benefit up to 400 non-mobile BTEC Art and Design students, who will realise the opportunity to develop their intercultural skills and maintain \u2018virtual\u2019 friendships through mixing with German and Maltese exchange students, who will be visiting the Institute through a reciprocal arrangement shortly before or after the outward mobilities in 2018. \r\n\r\nUpwards of 58% of learners on the Institute\u2019s BTEC Art and Media programmes experience severe financial hardship and/or additional support needs.

A recent study: \"Boosting the competitiveness of cultural and creative industries for jobs and growth\" shows that CCIs employ more than 12million people in the EU, more than 7.5% of the total workforce. Allied to this, Europe's rich cultural roots attract droves of tourists from all over the world. Therefore tourism and hospitality industries are a key component of our mutual industry sectors and a significant contributor to national and European economies.  However \"EU Skills Panorama\" (Cedefop), highlights recruitment difficulties for jobs as diverse as bakers, confectionery makers, textile workers and graphic design, partly because employers see a lack of technical skills. Adjusting VET education and training schemes to the realities on the ground has been identified as a top priority for the EU. Aligned to the European Skills Agenda, the UK is ushering in a new era of technical education through T-Levels and  Institutes of Technology in order to address the lack of relevant skills to meet labour market needs. \r\n\r\nWithin this context, ASSET presents an active 12 month cooperation between EU VET schools and colleges to develop creative collaborations in art, design and culinary programmes, with an emphasis on modern, future-oriented training through job relevant placements. Staff mobilities will observe, inform and transform L3 learner placements, working with employers and host partners to identify and instill a fresh European perspective on the current UK challenge to develop substantive work placements within L3 training programmes.\r\n\r\nParallel student mobilities will provide young learners with preparation for life and work through 3 week placements in world famous galleries (Galerie Julian Sander), textile houses (Esprit), theatres (Essen Theatre) and restaurants (L'hotel Paris), developing technical and employability skills that will make them an ASSET to any employer within a burgeoning international market. \r\n\r\nASSET will provide:\r\n - 26 x 3-week student mobilities to 3 European countries: Germany (Bonn and Dusseldorf), France and Malta;\r\n - 8 x 1-week staff mobilities to 3 European countries;\r\n - Reciprocal mobilities for four European partners, in Germany, France and Malta, welcoming 26 students and 6 staff to the Grimsby Institute. \r\n\r\nThe Institute operates in an area of entrenched social and economic deprivation, where over 50% of our learners are drawn from the three most educationally deprived wards in England (IMD) and levels of youth unemployment and NEET statistics remain stubbornly high. For our Level 3 (16-18 year old) learners, this project represents a groundbreaking chance to travel and work abroad, contributing to global industry in a form that we cannot currently provide for our students in North East Lincolnshire. Their tutors, who are all fully qualified and industry experienced, will be offered the opportunity to shine through CPD to develop their teaching methodology and practice in support of the Institute's strategic implementation of T-Levels. \r\n\r\nAs a result of ASSET, the Institute will develop its approach to curriculum (with a particular emphasis on work based training), develop teaching staff and managers and drive innovations in course design that will deliver quality improvements, enhance employer/education communication and relationships and provide high quality new T-Level qualifications that are \"right first time\".\r\n\r\nWhilst we reframe our teaching and learning by drawing upon best practice in the EU context, our ambition is also for learners to experience work placements build their own cultural, technical and employability knowledge, skills and competencies in European countries who are advanced to the UK on the work based training agenda.  \r\n\r\nASSET will impact 26 learners who will become more skilled and employable within key industry sectors and 8 staff who are more experienced and confident in delivering work based learning programmes, with indirect impacts on a further 500 Institute staff and learners through contact with EU colleagues during reciprocal mobility arrangements. \r\n\r\nProject results will be shared with 23,000 learners and1200 staff via films, presentations and social media, developing inclusive European culture and widening participation in mobility programmes.
