The goal of increasing physical activity must focus on a range of resources (parks, squares, green commons, streets, rivers, lakes, sea\u2026). In this scenario, HEPNESS assumes an innovative holistic standpoint: focusing on ecosystems services for outdoor activities, providing several responses to current health, socio-economic and environmental challenges. Integrating physical activity into daily lives is a creative process, where cities can enhance resources, before building new infrastructures. It is a process that requires the contribution of numerous cities departments and public private partnership amid cities, sport associations, tourism organizations, healthy and educational settings. By providing methodological and practical tools, and by Reinforcing the capacity of decision makers to define people centred policies and develop interventions for physical activities promotion that draw on the contribution of numerous sectors, HEPNESS generates new leadership for the promotion of health sport cities.The \u201cHEPNESS Perspective\u201d and the \u201cFramework of practices\u201d are developed with the purpose of inspiring numerous cities to implement health-sport programs, and enhance recreational ecosystem services for active lifestyle.The Perspective is a conceptual outline which highlights several dynamic ecosystems factors and their complex interactions for outdoor physical activities and health cities development.The Framework is a practical tool, bringing together researches, knowledge and good practices, supporting cities to design health and sport programs to maximize level of outdoor physical activities in nature.", "http://www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_579646-EPP-1-2016-2-IT-SPO-SCP_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT64"}
