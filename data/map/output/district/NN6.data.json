It aims to train the next generation of researchers to work in diverse teams, to cross disciplinary and sectoral boundaries and apply advanced communication and information technologies to work across many scales of time and space. Detailed project objectives are:\n1.  To provide scientific and professional development to a highly motivated group of early stage researchers (ESRs) to address a number of key interdisciplinary research issues of great importance to the future of transport industries.\n2.  To facilitate and support scientific and professional development of two experienced researchers (ERs) to enable them to become the research leaders in two challenging interdisciplinary research areas.\n3.  To disseminate the knowledge and products developed through scientific research to industry, policy makers and the wider academic community for maximum impact of the research.\n4.  To initiate a sustainable long-term research, training and educational collaboration between the partners involved.\nHere we propose the development of a training network that brings together some of the key active research groups in Europe, with a leading international reputation, in complementary areas relevant to the fields of tribochemistry and interface design. A number of leading industrial companies, comprising of SMEs and LEs, will engage in training and facilitate the Transfer of Knowledge (ToK) to and from the industrial partner through research programmes for 12 ESRs and 2 ERs.

New lubrication technologies will significantly increase engine efficiency and decrease emissions in automotive applications.", "Energy is one of the most important areas of research development in the 21st century as increasing human activities put increasing pressures on global climate and the environment. While renewable resources will form an important piece of the future energy puzzle, combustion will remain an important contributor for a long time to come, making improvements in combustion technologies an important contributor to a greener society.\n\nICEs include gasoline and diesel engines, gas turbine engines and even rocket propulsion systems. They are found in everything from cars to industrial machines to space shuttles. A large training network is focusing on development of a new generation of clean and energy-efficient engines with EU support of the http://www.enticeitn.eu/page/entice (ENTICE) (Engineering tribochemistry and interfaces with a focus on the internal combustion engine) project.\n\nTribological processes at interfaces in relative motion and the associated friction and wear are critical to efficient ICEs. These engines convert chemical energy in the bonds of fuel into mechanical work to move parts. Greener lubricants with improved performance will both eliminate harsh chemicals and additives while increasing energy efficiency, and thus reducing emissions. ENTICE is supporting 10 early-stage researchers (ESRs) and 2 experienced researchers, with 2 more ESRs currently being recruited.\n\nThe team is studying the physics associated with the tribochemistry of lubricated contacts. Development of both experimental, analytical and measurement techniques as well as models will aid understanding of processes. In parallel, scientists are investigating oil ageing (lubricant degradation) within the context of tribochemistry processes to develop better and greener lubricants. Experimental simulation of engine tribology systems will enable bench testing of improved systems for automotive engines.\n\nResearchers are taking advantage of numerous academic and industrial training courses complemented by teamwork and mentoring. The productive and enthusiastic collaboration is now leading to the first publications of results. The ENTICE training network is preparing a new generation of scientists to develop significantly more efficient ICEs for cars.

Preschool Matija Gubec with its project \"Different approaches to creative teaching in early and preschool age children\" encourages lifelong learning of its employees through professional training in EU. To develop and raise the quality of work of the institution, we recognized the importance of two specific areas. The first area relates to education for sustainable development and outdoor education with children. Environment of the child, especially a natural one becomes an important factor in the educational process. It encourages a full psycho-motor development of the child, develops awareness of the importance of physical education and a sense of living in harmony with nature and learning about ecology (exploitation of natural resources and raising awareness of responsible attitude towards the environment). The second area is early English learning, which we consider to be an important factor in helping preschool children develop communication competence in a foreign language. Increasing the quality of short and full daily curriculum enriched with English learning is one of the goals of our institution. This is possible only with high-quality continuous training of employees working in the programs. These areas are an important part of the curriculum in our institutions and in accordance with the National Curriculum for Preschool Education. The main objective of the project is to improve knowledge about unconventional ways of teaching based on the latest psychological and pedagogical knowledge, theoretical and methodological assumptions in accordance with the modern concept of creative teaching.
