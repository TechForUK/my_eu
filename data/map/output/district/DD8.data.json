Participation of young people in making decisions about their own lives is a key element of the project.  Key objectives include exposing our young people to new experiences and opportunities, learning about Europe, engaging in informal learning as a key element of youth work, to develop interpersonal and life skills,  and learn how to be peer leaders and impact our organisations positively.  \r\nThere are young people participating who come from a range of backgrounds.  The young people have fewer social and economic opportunities and this project is a real way for them to devleop their skills and atticitued, both in terms of personal development, active citizenship and employability.  Activitites will include participating in physical leisure time activities, programmes to develop mindfulness and resilience and the participation in a youth leadership programme.  Methodologies will include group work, self directed learning, multimedia activiteis and planning and participation in porgrammme development.  The project will result in young people who have a greater understanding of themelves and of other young people from Europe, will result in more confident and socially aware young people who have changing attitudes about the opportunites and options available to them, and will result in young people who are more positive about their future and what they can do to influence it.

The project will support school development to raise attainment and to close the poverty related attainment gap. We hope to raise the expectations and aspirations of our learners, staff and families through the provision of high quality teaching and learning, which is supported in school, at home and in the community. From our youngest learners at Early Level to our Second Level learners who will move on to Forfar Academy, it is important that they all have more confidence in their languages ability. To achieve this, the two participants will deliver languages training for teaching and non-teaching staff, and for families. The number of school staff exceeds 30, plus the families of our 329 learners so the project is wide reaching, with long-term benefits. \r\n\r\nThis project offers an unprecedented opportunity for the school to gain learning and teaching resources which make languages learning both engaging and achievable for our learners, as we need teaching staff who are confident in their abilities to deliver quality learning to other members of our school community. Participants will gain an improved understanding of modern French culture and the French education system which cannot be achieved without being in France and interacting with French teaching professionals. This will be shared with school and authority colleagues, enabling learners to have a greater understanding of Europe and their role and responsibilities as global citizens. The use of IT will support both teaching and learning, but also provide opportunities to engage with learners in other countries which has not been undertaken before. \r\n\r\nThe two participants have a varying expertise in delivery of modern languages. They are both full time members of staff, who are committed not only to their own professional learning, but to the learning of their colleagues. The training in language and methodology through the immersion courses will help the participants, and subsequently school staff to embed French into the daily life of the school. Subsequently, the school will be in  a much improved position to implement L3 into the school curriculum. \r\n\r\nActivities to engage our families and local community will provide opportunities for staff and learners to share their learning, and enthusiasm for languages. To have the intended impact, we will engage with our whole school community, not just our learners and staff. We intend to do this through family learning events, and community engagement through events and inter-generational learning. To raise the expectations and aspirations of our learners and families, we will raise the importance of learning a modern language through engagement with local businesses who use languages. This will have the impact of making meaningful links with the world of work (DYW national priority) and skills for learning, life and work. \r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of this project include achievement of the national 1+2 strategy, closing the poverty related attainment gap which is very pertinent to Strathmore where more than a third of our learners are in areas of multiple socio-economic deprivation (as measured by SIMD data), and raising the aspirations of our learners and families in a global society. Learning and teaching of modern languages will become embedded into the curriculum, with progression evident throughout the school. Confidence in teaching languages will be higher with all staff recognising the benefits of languages learning for all, not just some. This will help us to achieve equity, not just equality in our provision. By learning languages, our learners will be supported in developing a resilient attitude to learning. This in turn will help to raise attainment.", "http://www.strathmoreschool.co.uk", "Strathmore Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047316_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DD8"}
