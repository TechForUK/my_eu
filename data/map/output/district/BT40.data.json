The project will involve 33 young people, aged between 14 and 17 years of age, and will include young people from a wide range of backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis 10-day exchange will focus on the themes of citizenship and culture, through group work sessions, taking part in national sports, outdoor activities, myths & legends workshops and cultural/historical visits.  Our methodologies during the exchange will enable us to equip all participants with the knowledge, skills and confidence to become active members of the European community.  All groups will be involved in the planning and delivery of the daily itinerary, and will undertake leadership roles throughout the exchange.  Daily monitoring and regular evaluations will occur on an individual and group basis.\r\n\r\n On this exchange, we will be facilitating discussion around our shared European citizenship, youth & national cultures and identity.  We will explore this through presentations on cultures, participation in national sports and games, and the local myths & legends that have formed our identities.  Participation is an underpinning theme of the whole programme, which allows the young people and leaders to learn about identity, democracy & diversity.  Participants will learn about our national differences and similarities, and will gain a better understanding of each other.\r\n\r\nThroughout the programme participants will record the exchange through media and written forms, and in nightly meetings to monitor the progress of the exchange.  Participants will take part in a mid-way and final evaluation as well as an evaluation /  celebration event which includes parents, following the programme.\r\n\r\nThe potential long-term benefits include: enhanced confidence, greater self-awareness, political awareness, use of ICT & researching skills, communication & presentation skills, environmental awareness, knowledge of Good Relations concepts, increased knowledge and awareness of differing laws, customs and traditions, and enhanced career prospects.", "http://www.larnecommunitycare.org", "Larne Community Care Centre", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035209_coordinator"]]}}, "2SF": {"cordis": {"data": [[1430438400000, 1588204800000, "STORY- Added value of STORage in distribution sYstems", "B9 Energy Storage Ltd", "The main objective of STORY is to show the added value storage can bring for a flexible, secure and sustainable energy system. This will be achieved by showing the inter-relations between technologies and stakeholders as well as the potential and impact of policy and regulation.\n\nThe future European grid has to serve a diverse and mixed landscape of users in a situation of mixed rules and responsibilities depending on the policy and regulatory choices that will be made. Challenges include high penetration of renewables, bi-directional flows of different energy vectors, growing number of users and requirements for higher security. The European commission wants to strengthen the position of the EU energy industry, including those players active in producing solutions for security of supply, increased share of renewables and grid stability. The advances in ICT technology, intelligent control algorithms, inverter and storage technologies provide strong tools to cope with these challenges. \nGiven this context, STORY focuses on providing relevant and wide-covering demonstrations that serve as input for a thorough and transparent analysis on what the impact of storage can be for the involved stakeholders. Storage is considered as a means, while not neglecting other competing technologies that could provide a similar or complementary functionality. \nThe actions that the 18 members from 9 European countries in STORY consortium are going to take in a 5-year project bring a valuable contribution to turn these challenges into opportunities. They will not only develop the most viable storage and ICT solutions for the demonstration sites, but they will also analyse the impact of large penetration of the technologies through simulations, analyse the effect of policies and regulations to the business opportunities of storage related industry and communicate the findings to wider community through systematic strategies for impact creation.", 1171651.0, 12857796.0, 8, 19, "STORY", null, null, null, "h2020_194425_940662933"], [1262304000000, 1356912000000, "WIDE spectral band & WIDE dynamics multifunctional imaging SENSor Enabling safer car transportation", "Raptor Photonics Ltd", "The White Paper on EU Transport Policy for 2010 states a key objective: 50% reduction of casualties due to road accidents by the end of 2010.
