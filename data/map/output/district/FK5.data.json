Starting with efficient fulfilment of various customer demands the red line goes along efficient utilization of Big Data sources, present knowledge and critical new knowledge foreseen as outcomes from this project.\nTechnical development and mechanization has been a winning concept for high productivity now emphasizing more gentle methods and just in time deliveries to different industry customers. This is possible to reach if new knowledge, improved methods and technical development are combined with better transfer of information and data from different sources (e.g processes, geo data from LiDAR scanning, other conditions such as weather data etc).These Big Data sources have been available for some years, but it is not until recently that hardware, data communication and merging possibilities enable full potential for a revolution of new applications. \nIn the EFFORTE proposal we have identified three main subjects that have specific importance for efficiency, productivity and environmental concern in forest practice. Two of these implies to increasing crucial knowledge and the third, Big Data applications, combines the new knowledge with high resolution information sources into practice increasing efficiency in forest management and the connected value chains. The main objectives of EFFORTE are: i) To develop scientifically firm and techno-economically feasible methodology to predict trafficability prior to forest operations. ii) To increase forest growth and productivity of tree planting and young stand management iii) To develop, customize and pilot modern \u2018Big data\u2019 solutions that will increase productivity and decrease negative environmental impact (e.g. soil, water and reduced fuel consumption). By EFFORTE we expect to make difference in efficiency, productivity and sustainability for a growing Bio-based economy in Europe.", null, 3666948.0, "EFFORTE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205610_923872524"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FK5"}
