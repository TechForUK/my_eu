However, the take-up of simulation software by SMEs has until now been low due to high barriers of entry that include hardware prices, licensing costs and technical expertise. The CloudSME project will develop a cloud-based, one-stop-shop solution that will significantly lower these barriers, provide a scalable platform for small or larger scale simulations, and enable the wider take-up of simulation technologies in manufacturing and engineering SME's. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will support end user SME's to utilise customised simulation applications in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based provision. Moreover, simulation software service providers and consulting companies will have access to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution that enables them to quickly assemble custom simulation solutions in the cloud for their clients. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will be built on existing and proven technologies provided by the project partners and partially developed in previous European projects. Building on existing technology will enable the project to deliver its results quickly. The project consortium includes experienced partners, incorporating 12 SME's, from cloud hardware and platform providers, to simulation software providers, end users and technology integrators. To guarantee greater impact of the developed solution, additional use-cases will be provided by a further 10 partners following an open call after the first year of the project. The CloudSME Simulation Platform will dramatically change the way in which manufacturing/engineering SME's utilise simulation solutions today, and will provide new business opportunities not only to end-user SME's, but also to simulation software and cloud service providers.A typical experimental scenario in the project is based around an insole design simulation program developed by one of the partners, used for designing tailored insoles for sports footwear and for people with foot problems. The end user company in the project has patented a method for scanning feet in 3D and the experiment will involve linking this to a cloud-based version of the simulation software to design insoles and simulate the interaction of feet and insoles. In turn, this design is loaded into a CNC machine to manufacture the insoles. The aim of the cooperation is to establish a portal through which scans can be uploaded to the cloud-based software service which then validates the scanned image to produce the design. The experiment will explore the extent to which the service supporting the lifecycle of tailored insole production can be achieved. This will immediately lead to extensions of the software for checking images within other industries unrelated to the footwear business.", 30216.0, 4193116.0, "CloudSME", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109223_938275181"], ["4JF", "Avoiding and mitigating safety risks in urban environments", "London Borough of Waltham Forest", "The main objective of the City.Risks project is to increase the perception of security of citizens in cities by activating in a more transparent and sustainable way their participation in communities, through which information and interventions can be provided both to proactively protect citizens from falling victims to criminal activities as well as to reactively provide more timely and effective response and assistance.

Comprehensive care, social support and community treatment outside of mental health institutions, as demonstrated by decades of empirical research on treatment results significantly contribute to better life quality and recovery. According to the National Strategy for the Development of Mental Health of the Republic of Serbia (2007.), in the past years the number of people suffering from mental health problems has been increasing as a result of the accumulated stress originated from impoverishment, wars and overall decaying life standards. People with mental health problems represent a social group on which society has plenty of misconceptions and little information. Prejudice, stereotypical representations, and fear originated by lack of information and experience with this vulnerable group are the result of insufficient interest on the part of the public, often resulting in discrimination against them. Taking in consideration the fact that only in the last few years we managed to slightly raise public awareness on this subject, and that prejudice and discrimination both by public and professionals, are very present and strong, mostly due to the lack of information and education on the subject, organization of education is of crucial importance in this phase of de-institutionalisation of mental health system. Only in the last 2 years some interest came from the EU, some small steps were taken toward improvement of situation, through the process of de-institutionalisation, reform in psychiatric system that includes transition from strictly institutional and medical treatment toward community initiatives, development of community services and centers for mental health, global change of attitudes toward psychiatric care users, change of practices and old fashion methods rooted in Serbian system of mental health. Hearing Voices, apart from being an alternative tool in the treatment and the new path in contemporary psychiatry practice in the world, also represents one of the most active contemporary tendencies in the fight for human rights of this population. Prostor has been working towards development of community based services and de-stigmatization of this population in Serbia since 2010, developing the Community Mental Health model. It is an official representative of the International Hearing Voices Network and one of the founders of the regional West Balkan HV Network. Partner organization Mind in Camden, representative of the English HV Network, is a charity established in 1985, that provides directly services to over 1000 people with serious mental health problems yearly, and has a wealth of experience in training, consultancy and delivering innovative services. Through this project, the staff of Prostor will participate in a mobility activity in the UK, where they will have an opportunity to experience the application of this practice in a completely different atmosphere in the field of psychiatry and human rights characterized by the European dimension and proper implementation of human right laws, learning form the colleagues from the UK from their good practices and long experience in this field. During the stay in London, Mind in Camden will organize a 4-day training for Prostor staff, aiming to transfer following knowledge: advanced group facilitation based on Hearing Voices methods, organization of educational activities in the community and within psychiatric institutions, monitoring of practitioners who participated on the educational activities and follow up, maintaining local and regional network, disseminating and public awareness rising activities. During its work, Prostor has been recognized by the institutions as a partner in the reform of mental health system, in particular in the process of de-institutionalization, and has officially partnered with all major psychiatric institutions and the local government, especially through organization of educational activities for professionals, persons with mental health problems, students and NGOs. In the last 3 years, Prostor organized trainings accredited by the Regional Medical Chamber of Serbia as a part of continuous medical education. Through this project, Prostor staff will improve their organizational skills in the field of education and gain new knowledge and competences in monitoring and follow up of the implementation of gained knowledge in practice. Taking in consideration the importance of public awareness rising on the subject of mental health, prevention and human rights of psychiatric care users, Prostor is planning to undertake serious dissemination and PR efforts, promoting the results of this project and Erasmus+ program and support, and at the same time reaching to a wider public, aiming to improve the social status and life quality of psychiatric care users in Serbia.", "http://www.mindincamden.org.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-RS01-KA104-000087_1"], ["8AB", "\"Art is in(clusion)!\"", "LoveLife Generation", 23079.0, "\"Art is in(clusion)!\" is a youth exchange that will take place in the city of \u017dilina from September 1 till September 10 2017. 45 young participants with and without disability, with and without or fewer opportunities from Portugal, Germany, Spain, Great Britain, Greece, Poland, Slovakia and Czech Republic will come together in mixed ability groups, will meet, get to know each other, exchange ideas and experience trans-national group dynamics.
