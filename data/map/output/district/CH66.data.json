Within this, further aims are: to see French taught consistently across Key Stage Two; to increase language skills, develop positive attitudes and levels confidence of staff teaching French; to develop methodology to ensure that progression in French is taught effectively, and to develop the role of the subject leader.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this project is to equip the school for the compulsory languages element of the new primary curriculum, coming into force in September 2014.  Currently, only four of the eleven Key Stage Two classes are receiving consistent French teaching, with one receiving occasional French teaching.  Key reasons for this are a lack of confidence of teaching a language which many have not had experience with since school themselves, and a lack of awareness of how to approach teaching French.\r\n\r\nDue to one of the main reasons for French not being currently taught consistently across Key Stage Two being reluctant attitudes towards language learning, a carefully selected mixture of staff have been chosen to attend immersion courses in France.  There will be four participants taking part in the project.  Two members of  staff who are enthusiastic about French will be paired with two members of staff who are less confident, and more reluctant in engage in teaching French.\r\n\r\nWhen in France, participants will spend their time in French immersion classes, developing their own pedagogical and subject knowledge, along with their intercultural understanding.  The aim of pairing more reluctant members of staff with staff who are already passionate about French is to ignite their own interests and enthusiasm about language learning, through first hand experience, and through seeing a purpose and a value of providing French education to pupils.\r\n\r\nOn return to England, participant's enthusiasm and passion will inspire other members of staff to develop their own skills and understanding, through being involved in training and support delivered by the participants.  Training will involve team teaching, modelling lessons and activities, support in teaching sequences of French lessons, and sharing knowledge of the French culture.   Staff will also learn about meaningful links of French to other areas of the primary curriculum, for example how learning French can support the development of spelling, phonics, and grammar in pupil's mother tongue.  \r\n\r\nAs a consequence of teachers at Woodlands Primary School being prepared and supported in delivering French lessons, children will be taught French regularly, in a structured approach, building upon and embedding children's current skills.  If teachers continue to build upon this sound base, children will be  more confident in using their acquired language.  Under the support and guidance of the participants, staff will feel enthused, prepared, and more confident to deliver engaging, structured French lessons to pupils.", "http://www.woodlands.cheshire.sch.uk", "Woodlands Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000189_coordinator"], ["4SZ", "MFL Enhancement project", "Meadow Community Primary School", 3722.0, "In summary Meadow Primary School is a successful school which identified the value of teaching a language several years ago.  While we feel the teaching of French is good, we feel the profile of French can be enhanced with the introduction of the compulsory curriculum in September 2014.  We feel we are in a good position to move our teaching to outstanding by embedding French into our whole curriculum, not just as a stand alone subject. As a starting point we need to enhance the skills and knowledge of the staff. By sending two members of staff on the immersion courses in France, we will achieve this and we will raise the support for the key teacher who currently has been teaching French in isolation.  Using Meadow's current and proven methods of raising standards, we can ensure impact is assured.\r\n* Clear and precise objectives and actions within the school development plan \r\n* A rigorous baseline that can be used throughout the year to assess impact.\r\n* Team approach to introducing the changes through the task and finish team approach.\r\n* A support network in place for those leading the changes.\r\n* Quality training provided by attendance on the course and then staff meetings/twilights to introduce actions and train the wider staff.\r\n* Regular learning walks, lesson observations, staff and pupils interviews to identify impact as well as any strengths or further areas for development.\r\n* Half termly staff meetings to evaluate the SDP and progress made towards the objectives.\r\n* Subject leader working alongside the Curriculum leader to ensure statutory requirements are covered.   \r\nWe intend to provide our pupils with not only a wider French vocabulary but the opportunity to learn in an environment where those skills and knowledge are valued and celebrated by every teacher.

It was clear that many staff feel that they are not providing the national curriculum criteria to the desirable standard. It was also highlighted in a previous Ofsted inspection that there is a lack of cultural understanding at the school.Our project is to send 4 teaching staff on short immersion courses in France, through the Erasmus + programme. we feel this will address our needs and the project will enable staff to teach more French during thematic lessons with more confidence. Furthermore it will greatly improve the cultural understanding of the staff and the children. The children will then benefit as they have more opportunities to practice and learn French and will make more progress. This new thematic approach will be commencing in September 2016.In France, our teachers will benefit from the expertise of other tutors when planning French schemes of work. The teachers will also be spending a full day in a primary school. This will give a snapshot of what day to day life is like for children in France. The course will be tailored to the particular needs of the staff who will be going to France and this should ensure that the staff can make the most of the opportunity they have been given. Methodology and pedagogy skills will be developed that can be integrated into classrooms at Rossmore.French will be happening more often with the children making clear progress and being at least in line with expectations. There will also be an even balance of all four skills and grammar teaching with the children enjoying lessons.

Two lead teachers were ex students together, in English universities; and also with faith links, alongside the schools' having similar aims, a link was soon inevitable. First beginning as a writing project, with postcards and letters sent to each other, it soon developed into a shared desire for a primary foreign exchange. Things rolled on, and in autumn 2013, the first 'intercambio' took place. Fourteen students from Pamplona arrived to stay in the homes of families in Ellesmere Port, with a return trip in June 2014. Although quite unusual in both countries, the Year 6 primary exchange trip was a massive success. Students shared school lessons together; lived each other's lifestyles; and went on days out, speaking a little of each other's language. Most importantly, they became the best of friends, on Skype, Facebook and so on. They also realised that the world was a much smaller place than they imagined; and began to aspire to speak other languages better; & perhaps to travel abroad to live and work in the future.\r\n\r\nThe project was a bit of a trial though, and costly for each school; it had to be subsidised heavily for parents, whose circumstances often prohibited an 'expensive holiday'. Both schools though became determined that the project was absolutely vital; 'superimportante' as Alberto Burguete, the Spanish headteacher, called it. Rob Hughes, headteacher at St Mary of the Angels, heard about the new Erasmus Plus grant system. Soon, an application for a three year, joint Strategic Partnership was put into place; with the added element of a real need for joint staff training on key curricular, pedagogical and language skills, over the three years.\r\n\r\nOur main objectives are;\r\n* we embed and sustain a Primary Foreign Exchange/Languages programme for our two schools, in which each school invests heavily. 14 children from each school will travel to their partner school, each year, for 3 years, with flexibility to increase numbers if we can. We are already starting to raise extra funds now to embed it permanently, beyond the Erasmus project;\r\n*we support this via a series of planning and teaching visits between our staffs, including staff training projects in art, sport and literacy, in each school. Teachers would be released to plan and deliver the projects, across the three years, with expertise in each school helping those in their partner organisation to embed new skills;\r\n* we support all staff in each school to become more proficient with the foreign language, via ongoing staff training investment, both 'face to face' and also digitally; the Europass system will be the backbone of this strategy.\r\n*we'll work together in additional research on further pedagogy. For example, St Mary's is involved in a national Assessment for Learning project, based in Cheshire, with renowned AfL expert, Professor Dylan William. We aim to improve student self and peer assessment; innovate with marking; & use practical assessment improvements in our classrooms, to help children in each school to be more independent learners. Many of the skills are certainly 'transnational' and we intend to measure the impacts, before the findings are published, in 2016.\r\n\r\nOur desired outcomes?\r\n*Increased, improved language learning opportunities for all our pupils & staff, measured via official European accreditation.\r\n*Greatly enhanced teaching skills for all our staff, through 'face to face' training and web contact with partner colleagues\r\n*Much higher self esteem for pupils involved in the exchanges, especially for those who are disadvantaged in some way, by personal circumstances\r\n*More effective pedagogy in both schools through curriculum enhancement, involving expert staff from each school sharing skills with others. Through the innovative assessment project, we hope to increase pupil independence; and give them much greater clarity about improving their work, by teaching them how to learn.\r\n\r\nThen there are the 'unseen' outcomes. Pupils - and staff - becoming more aspirational; wanting to study languages/travel abroad more; a lifelong love of other cultures developing; seeing new types of employment, in other countries, that they'd never seen before; realising that they could move to other parts of the EU, if they want. These are all outcomes that we are sure are achievable...\r\n\r\nOutcomes will be published on each school website; and our headteachers, who are both involved in networking, locally and regionally, will disseminate these at various conferences over the three years. Each website will be updated monthly, following regular review/evaluation meetings in each school (and bi-monthly, joint reviews via video conference).\r\n\r\nAnd watch out for us on social media!", "http://www.stmaryoftheangels.co.uk", "Saint Mary of the Angels Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000236_coordinator"], ["2NU", "Social Media and Education: Threats and Opportunities.", "The Whitby High School", 125055.0, "This is a strategic partnership of five European High Schools to achieve best practices in the usage of social media, especially within an educational context.

We as teachers want to prepare our students for a changing Europe in which they learn how to cope with many different cultures and will benefit from living in a multicultural, but a united Europe. The title refers not only to the changing European future but also directly to people on the move. We have chosen to reflect the movement of refugees in the order set for the short-term exchanges: From the first contact with Europe to the struggles refugees have to face in their everyday life; from the historical point of view to the most recent events.  In all countries involved, neo-national tendencies gain strength and democratic and European values are in danger. The first of the project's most important objectives is to prepare our students against these neo-national tendencies in their own country and strengthen the attitude towards domcracy in the European community  and the idea of a united Europe. To support this goal, it is necessary to show our students different perspectives of the refugee crisis in Europe.  Furthermore, students gain competences in media literacy by reflecting on the national and European coverage of the refugee crisis on TV and in newspapers. Through personal contact with refugees the project participants will understand the background of the refugee crisis (e.g. reasons for leaving the countries of origin, living conditions for refugees in European countries, legal process for asylum seekers) and get motivated to help refugees actively. Through personal contact with refugees our students will develop empathy and fight stereotypes. The project \"Refugees in Europe- Our future in motion\" is designed for 13-16 year-olds from different nationalities, social backgrounds, school communties and experience on the refugee topic. One special aspect of our project is that refugee students participate in the project. About 90 students and 60 teachers will directly benefit from the project in the short term exchanges.Activity days and charity events are the core activites of our project as the project participants will seek motivation and interest from this. Getting active together in sports-activities, cooking events and tandem partnerships will build up a positive attitude among the project participants. Talks and debates with experts provide first hand information on the background of the refugee crisis.  Personal stories of refugees broaden this theoretical knowledge and enable stronger long term learning effects. Not only will the project participants analyze the media coverage within Europe, but hey will create TV/webradio shows and newspaper articles themselves to disseminate the project results. Simulation games and activities help our students to put themselves in the shoes of a refugees, but also European institutions. The methodology of our project is built on the belief that personal contact and experiences with refugees and diversity in general will have a stronger impact on the long term learning than only theory. This is why we will include refugees and stories of personal experience in our project whenever possible. Expert knowledge will be integrated, too. We imply continuity as a method of our project by establishing Erasmus+ Clubs with weekly meetings for the preparation and disseminatination of the project results.The flexible adjustment of activities is a basic element of the methodology used in this project. Due to the ever changing situation within the European refugee crisis all project partners have to respond flexibly to the current situation and the needs of the project partners. Some of the most important results are the project charity calendar, TV and radio shows, a photo exbition about European borders and the displays with photos and summary articles of the short term exchanges in each partner school. An induction programme will improve the integration of refugees within the partner schools. The attitudes of our project participants towards refugees and the future of Europe will be greatly affected: Students will understand the hardship, the needs and the motives of refugees to leave their lives behind and the need to find a common European solution to the crisis.Looking at the long term benefits of this project, the students will learn how to get actively involved and respond to challenges in society not only on a national but also on a Europan level.

Ever since the end of World War 2, people have been concerned about human rights. During the war, many people had been badly treated because of their race or religion or because they were prisoners of warThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drawn up by world leaders in 1948 because they wanted to prevent such terrible things happening again. It states that everyone has a right to life and liberty, freedom of speech and movement, a fair wage, a fair trial, education and many other basic human rights.Unfortunately today our world faces similar problems with many humans living in fear of their lives and are denied their basic human rights. The brutality of terrorism is being experienced by more and more European countries, and the challenges that it poses have rarely been more intractable. As a result of this, Europe is divided by the refugee problem. In many countries politicians don\u2019t know how to handle the huge amount of refugees and people feel threatened by it, causing them even to act violently towards refugees and politicians. This endangers the democratic system and might also endanger the European unity.

At a pupil level, there was a sharing of sports and arts projects, in our Year 6 classes. The primary pupil exchange element of this scheme was highly unusual & incredibly successful. The three years flew by, with strong links developing at many levels. Pupils visited each other; learnt together, in both languages; and many are still in touch, whether on Skype, email or even via return visits with their families!

Post-project language testing against Europass and Common European Framework criteria will measure progress for everyone involved.\r\n*We will ensure that mobility places are prioritised for students with special needs, and also those living in areas of disadvantage in each country - as this is a an issue for both schools, and is also firmly in line with European ET 2020 objectives.\r\n\r\nOur desired outcomes and impacts?\r\n*Improvements in language learning, at all levels, for all stakeholders, measured against EU criteria, before and after the project.\r\n*A sharing of development planning, including quality curriculum materials, resulting in improved digital knowledge, skills and also literacy levels for every student on the course - tested in post-unit teacher assessments.\r\n*Greatly improved self esteem for pupils taking part, via the high quality learning and exchange experiences, across the nations - resulting in high level ICT learning and increased self worth, particularly for our special needs and disadvantaged pupils.\r\n*More effecting teaching in both schools, and a raising of aspirations in our teaching & senior staff, by working with supportive colleagues abroad, enabling innovation, deep learning and self-reflection, enhancing the profession overall.\r\n*Increased liaison between other school stakeholders - governors and socios; parent associations in each school - so that a holistic view of how each organisation runs will enable best practice sharing at every level, increasing aspiration across the board.\r\n\r\nEighty four children and sixty three staff will be directly involved in mobilities; but as the children & staff visit each other's schools, many more teachers and learners will be impacted positively, during the teaching and learning activities. Our past experience tells us this. Parents' funds raised over the next 3 years will ensure the partnership continues deep into the future. We have a joint, immovable determination to ensure this, for future generations of our primary students, in each country.\r\n\r\nOutcomes and our new resources  will be published in full, on school websites, at regional and local conferences in each country; in the press; and on our fantastic 'Digital Skills for All' website - created by the children themselves!
