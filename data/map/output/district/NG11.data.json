The core of the project is the roll out and demonstration of the first stage of the roadmap of four LNG Blue Corridors involves the building of approx. 14 new LNG or L-CNG stations on critical points/locations in the Blue Corridors and the building up of a fleet of approx. 100 LNG Heavy Duty Vehicles and/or DF vehicles operating along the corridors.

OpenNESS will therefore develop innovative and practical ways of applying them in land, water and urban management: it will identify how, where and when the concepts can most effectively be applied to solve problems. To do this, it will work with public and private decision makers and stakeholders to better understand the range of policy and management problems faced in different case study contexts (ranging across locales, sectors, scales and time). OpenNESS will consolidate, refine and develop a range of spatially-explicit methods to identify, quantify and value ecosystem services, and will develop hybrid assessment methods. It will also explore the effectiveness of financial and governance mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services, habitat banking, biodiversity offsetting and land and ecosystem accounting. These types of interventions have potential for sustaining ESS and NC, and for the design of new economic and social investment opportunities. Finally, OpenNESS will assess how current regulatory frameworks and other institutional factors at EU and national levels enable or constrain consideration of ESS and NC, and identify the implications for issues related to well-being, governance and competitiveness. OpenNESS will analyse the knowledge that is needed to define ESS and NC in the legal, administrative and political contexts that are relevant to the EU.

It examines how the concepts link to, and support, EU sectoral and cross-sectoral policy initiatives and scrutinizes its potential and limitations.\n\nCentral to OPENNESS is a multi-scale case study approach, designed to ground ideas and theories on real-world observations and analysis.

Trials will be undertaken in the UK especially  to comply with approvals for codes and standards, as well as assessing the economic fleet potential.  LNG was selected as the fuel because it is increasing in importance for trucks across the EU, with lower costs and much lower emissions than diesel trucks. Also, LNG is widely available throughout the EU with long-term supplies guaranteed for the next two centuries.  The SOFC was chosen because it can operate readily on LNG, while providing low emissions, low noise and good heat/chilling available.
