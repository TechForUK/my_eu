We still need to widen its European and international dimension which already exists through many projects, among which the cooperation between Bray and the vocational section of our school as regards the possibility for our students to go and get work experience abroad, and through the existence of a European section. \r\n\r\n- The school is asking for mobility for the Content and Learning Integrated Learning teachers and an English teacher of the European section. These three teachers want to organize more cross-disciplinary projects and the course will give them new methods to implement such projects and a better knowledge of the British culture as well as the opportunity to meet European partners.  \r\n\r\n- These teachers will then be asked to relay what they have learned to other teachers in Vaclav Havel to improve and promote cross-disciplinary projects. The ultimate goal of this project is the setting of a European cooperation project.", "http://www.cumbriaclil.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA101-001800_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CA4"}
