Our contract of objectives focuses on these aims. -preventing early school leaving-Strengthening the educational community-Opening out and developing partnerships.Studying and comparing working methods can help us benefit from them and achieve our goals more effectively. Having consulted our teams on their aspirations concerning their training and their needs, we realized that they massively wanted to improve their language skills, their use of new technologies and upgrade their personal teaching, pedagogical and organizational methods by comparing with other countries. The participants are active members of the group involved in international activities. They know the programmes and have a basic core of values: active and tolerant European awareness based on diversity, firm belief that that formation is essential to give our students, our colleagues and our school authorities a view of a complete educational system with future prospects of improving our own and for new curriculum for college 2016. They will be keen to ensure the dissemination and present our own way of functioning. The fundamental aim of the project is to observe new methods in foreign language teaching, as a main subject and in Content and Language Integrated Learning. Choosing a Spanish school and an English school will enable us to monitor didactical results for first foreign language and second foreign language.The subjects taught in English will be PE, maths and science, and techno will be taught in Spanish. At the same time; contacts with other schools will offer the participants further opportunities to create new Erasmus\u00a8+ projects. The opportunity to observe the diversity of the educational systems and be part of them as teachers is an invaluable source of richness in numerous aspects (Managing international teams, operation of a school, assessment of pupils, cultural diversity management policy, language learning, observance of the rules, dialogue with the parents, differentiated education, extracurricular activities, functioning of the associations inside the school, use of new technologies, hierarchy and authorities, local and national guidelines, use of CLIL for foreign languages.)As part of the project, a consortium will be organized between primary, lower and upper secondary schools, and possibly university, positioning itself as a hub of language teaching and European openness.Added to the Comenius / Erasmus + projects carried out for 16 years in our school, a SEPIA (Soutien \u00e0 l'Exp\u00e9rimentation P\u00e9dagogique et \u00e0 l'Innovation dans l'Acad\u00e9mie = Supporting Pedagogical Experimentation and Innovation in the Academy)  project will be implemented  in view of getting the CLIL certification and will be a key element of this excellence.The activities carried out will be based upon observation and participation in the activities both inside and outside school. We will also plan meetings with the administration members, the head teachers, the parents\u2019 associations and other local structures offering a different educative approach.The means of action for this project will be immersion in the host school, so that the participants become full members of the community. The expected outcome is the acquisition of teaching and analyzing methods, the improvement of communication skills (linguistic and social) and the opening up of new channels and possibilities for European cooperation. All this will have an impact on several levels:-individual: improvement of the skills and use of evolutionary pedagogical tools-local: in the host school (through the mobility report) as well as in the sending school because the pupils will benefit from the better educational performance of the participating teachers.-general : in the two countries\u2019 educational communities, because the results of this experience will be profitable to staff currently in post and to future participants.The long-term benefits are linked to the impact: training in foreign language teaching is essential to raise the long-lasting low level of skills in this field in France.This project is an approach to combat the inertia of non-linguistic French teachers not very confident in their skills in foreign languages.It is within this framework that experimenting innovative methods can have positive effects on our environment by improving our skills.", "http://www.sentamu.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA101-022829_6"], ["5YB", "BODY", "Archbishop Sentamu Academy", 108877.0, "The education systems need to change their priorities so that all European citizens can acquire the knowledge, skills and competences they need to meet the requirements of the labour market and face the challenges of modern life. Nowadays society is imposing barriers \u2013psychological, cultural or social- the state of well-being implies overcoming these and accepting one\u2019s peers. This can be achieved through efficient communication and cooperation between all factors involved in and out education. \r\nThe psychosocial competence plays an important role in the promotion of health to change one's knowledge, attitudes and values into actual abilities. This project aims at improving teachers and students\u2019 well-being by boosting their self-efficacy, self-confidence and self-esteem and involving them in activities in a friendlier learning environment.\r\nComplying with WHO requirements, this project aims to help the participants build a positive self-image and consciousness of the body in different contexts (educational, artistic, medical, sportive)\r\nThe challenge is to modify and make the relation to our own body evolve in an individual and collective approach. The actors of all ages, in more or less disabling conditions will meet  and share their experiences around two main objectives: my body and me (build oneself as a subject), my body and its needs.\r\nThe  schools will first handle the theme of the body in interdisciplnary co-operation, the hospitals will deal with therapy. The national theatre (with choreographers, dancers, actors) will conduct artistic research involving sense of touch and empathy in the relationship between artists, caregivers, patients, students and  teachers. The sports world will offer opportunities to exercise one's body.\r\nThe outputs of these experiences (reports, articles on the blog, videos) will be collected and shared during the meeting projects and disseminated out (through the use of new i-tools, e-books, online newspapers, digital open educational resources).We want to support youth activeness in the fields of healthy lifestyle.\r\nStudents are active in the planning, development and evaluation of the project.\r\nThe multiplicity of motivating activities will develop an individualized and efficient methodology which will meet their needs and difficulties.\r\nThe practicality of the actions will be enhanced by an unconventional approach, particularly with young people in a situation of under-achievement or exclusion acting as non stigmatized volunteers.\r\n Objectives are explained in such a way that they are measurable and quantifiable via indicators. Pupils and teachers will learn how to elaborate surveys and how to make the treatment of data in order to write different evaluation reports using tables, percentages and graphs. Knowledge transmission from professionals in their fields, secondary to primary schools will be an asset for their future. A network beyond the educational system can be created thanks to close interaction between the players.\r\nWe aim to treat foreign languages and the use of IT skills not as the main purpose of the project but as a tool to achieve other goals.\r\nThe various disciplines involved will contribute to promote solid foundation skills, such as literacy, numeracy and transversal key competences , learning to learn, sense of initiative (both in teachers and students) and entrepreneurship, social, civic and cultural competences, mathematical and logical thinking.\r\nIn addition, each structure involved in the partnership will take part in two informative and awareness raising congresses (in March 2017 and May 2018) where each country will present the place of the body as a tool to respond to the existing and future challenges and lead to the achievement of all.\r\nThis project takes into account the multiple intelligences that can be used and promoted. During three training courses, teachers will be able to attend practical workshops related to their own self-image and develop competences reusable in their everyday life.\r\nThese symposiums will be available on eTwinning to surroundings schools, the Inspection Acad\u00e9mique, local citizens and patients. \r\n Our priority is to make students responsible for their learning process via students\u2019 individual mobilities. Short, middle or long-term mobilities will be implemented in order to experiment workshops on well-being and their analyse and results presented to the other partners.\r\nOpen Educational Resources, Manual of Good Practices, products -online newspaper, e-book, documentary film, dvd with performances, prezi presentations- scientific research, health ideas, ...etc.. will be always available for free download through the website, blog, twinspace and Erasmus+ Dissemination platform). These clearly identified products will be usable by all the teachers interested in innovative valorization of teaching strategies.\r\nWe hope to create highlights in our communities to show and share this work on the universal issue of integrity .", "http://www.sentamu.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA219-014937_4"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["2BH", "RV9", "Newbridges - Inpatient Unit"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HU9"}
