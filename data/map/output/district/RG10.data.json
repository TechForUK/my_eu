The goal is to enable a 'Virtual Film Factory' in which creative professionals can work together to create and customise programmes from Petabyte-scale digital repositories, using semantic technologies to organise data and drive its processing. By separating metadata from essence, controlling all the image and sound processing operations from the metadata layer, we can maintain the underlying data library unchanged while enabling a new generation of more flexible applications. This will radically reduce the amount of data created: new versions, grades, or language releases only result in additional metadata, not new data files. The system will support a more automated workflow for content distribution from postproduction to the assembly, distribution and playout of multiple variations of programmes in different formats and locations. Outcomes will be:\\tAn infrastructure in which multi-Petabye data stores are managed by persistent metadata in a distributed metadatabase.\\tReal-time interaction with media sequences selected from the data store. When a sequence is changed, by an application, the commands are stored as a new set of metadata. The data remains unchanged in the store, but viewing and listening sequences are rendered 'on the fly.

The aims are divided into six objectives: 1) develop practical resources grounded in asset based knowledge to support new ways for public service actors to re-define operational processes, 2) produce and deliver nine real-life pilots to co-create a set of relational public services with various combinations of public sector, civil society and commercial actors, 3) draw together cross-cutting lessons from pilots and utilise innovative visualisation methods to share and validate new ideas and models of good governance, 4) apply innovative approaches appropriate to local contexts and user groups to gather the necessary user insight to co-create services, 5) ensure sustainability by establishing local trainers for animating dialogue and collating user voice, embedded in community networks, 6) mobilise new knowledge from piloting and validating by creating an accessible, user friendly roadmap to co-creation for service providers and their partners.\n\nThe project will be implemented as a joint venture with 24 partners from 10 EU countries.", 77439.0, 4329190.0, "CoSIE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212384_915581255"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9XR", "Cultural Experiences Through Service To Others", "Yeldall Christian Centres", 96437.0, "The project \u201cCultural Experiences Through Service To Others\u201d has been developed by Time For God drawing on our 50 years of experience in international volunteering.
