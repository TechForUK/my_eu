This would replace physical Aerospace Test Rigs with a virtual test rig to reduce development cost and lead-time by improving the robustness/integrity of surge/ two phase flow fluid modelling.  This allows aerospace companies to optimise architecture early in the design phase minimising installation and structural weight, increasing aircraft efficiency, thereby lowering operating cost and also reducing carbon footprint.\nCommercial realisation of the programme is through the sale of services/methodologies to aerospace customers and also potentially through the sale of validation test data to software houses to improve their marketing position relative to claims for predicting surge pressures; and the expansion of methodologies to cover fluid applications in other industries.\nFSE is uniquely positioned to succeed within this task due to existing surge analysis, test management and rig specification capabilities which will also protect further work that develop from this programme of work.\nThe feasibility study undertaken under Phase 1 will comprise:\n1.\tIP investigation\na.\tCurrent IP for similar methodologies\nb.\tUse of IP to protect methodologies\nc.\tUse of copyright to protect data\n2.\tPotential commercial arrangements with final customers\na.\tRequirements\nb.\tUse of data, services & methodologies \n3.\tPotential commercial arrangements with software house\na.\tSupport for commercial code\nb.\tUse of validation test data\n4.\tStatement of Work for Phase 2 (inc. plan & budget)\n5.\tTop level test facility requirements\n6.\tTop level test requirements\n7.\tProduce Comprehensive Feasibility Report\nIf Phase 1 is successful, further funding will be applied for under Horizon 2020 Phase 2 with FSE providing the balance of the funding.
