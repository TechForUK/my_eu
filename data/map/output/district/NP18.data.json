An investigation of these issues until now has been limited by the lack of tactile sensing technologies enabling large scale experimental activities, since so far skin technologies and embedded tactile sensors have been mostly demonstrated only at prototype stage. The new capabilities will improve the ability of robots to operate effectively and safely in unconstrained environments and also their ability to communicate and co-operate with each other and with humans. To support this aim, one part of the project will focus on the investigation of methods and technologies enabling the implementation of skin sensors that can be used with existing robots. Other parts of the project will develop new structures for representing and integrating tactile data with existing cognitive architectures in order to support skin-based cognition, behaviour and communication. As a result, the project will address three main objectives. The first is to develop new sensor technologies that can provide tactile feedback from large areas of the robot body. This development process will be incremental and will take advantage of feedback produced from the application of these technologies in the work done on the other project objectives. The second objective is to develop and integrate fundamental cognitive structures for efficient and safe utilisation of tactile data in terms of a robot body image, safe reflexive reactions to tactile events and flexible representations of spatially and temporally distributed patterns of physical contact. The last objective is to develop cognitive mechanisms that use tactile feedback to improve human-robot interaction capabilities particularly in the domains of programming through demonstration and robot assisted play.", 243802.0, 4045411.0, "ROBOSKIN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.newport.ac.uk", null, "fp7_89511_998510338"], ["3YG", "Towards a \u201cTopography\u201d of Tolerance and Equal Respect. A comparative study of policies for the distribution of public spaces in culturally diverse societies", "University of Wales Newport", "Tolerance has been increasingly invoked as the inspiring ideal of a number of social policies in European democracies. Appeals to tolerance have animated especially the political debates on those policies addressed to accommodate minorities\u2019 requests. Among such requests those for the allocation of public spaces have recently acquired pride of place in the political agendas of many European and extra-European countries (e.g. the allocation of space for Roma sites; Muslims\u2019 requests to build places of worship and housing policies for migrants). Despite such a generalized political and societal relevance of the notion of tolerance, some problems may occur when policies inspired by it are implemented. In particular, the implementation of tolerance-inspired spatial policies may result in the marginalisation of differences and thus risk undermining social cohesion. What conception of tolerance may be invoked to limit such a risk? To answer this question, we shall test the hypothesis that grounding tolerance on equal respect for persons may contribute to the development of spatial policies capable of resolving the tensions between tolerance and social cohesion in culturally diverse societies. In particular, the project pursues 4 objectives:1.to develop a conceptual taxonomy to clarify the liaisons between tolerance, respect and spatial issues;2.to study the ways in which appeals to tolerance have informed the development of spatial policies;3.to investigate the influence of cultural diversities on the interpretations of tolerance in different national contexts;4.to extrapolate from the above studies an overall view of the connections between tolerance and equal respect.

Clear focus is put on fast and reliable product behaviour by rapid learning in European pilot line environments. In addition, eRamp will enable the realization of innovative More-than-Moore devices by development of innovative process and manufacturing chains. Research will focus on enhanced, next generation, More-than-Moore semiconductor product ramp ups, dedicated to energy efficient power, MEMS and 3D based applications.
