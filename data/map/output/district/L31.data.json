In our eyes slowly - but surely - is changing the role of the school. It is no more an institution having a monopoly for knowledge, and it is  becoming one of the places which has wide access to it. The teacher of the future is a wise guide who understands the needs and also knows the limits of their own and their students. The teacher is to encourage the development but not to give knowledge and turnkey solutions - and bring up students without stereotypes and in a particular frame and also will be able to cope with the tasks facing the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of our project is to prepare  teachers - guides and school management to work in a modern way, skillfully and using new IT tools to work effectively. A very important aspect of the project is that, while learning to have personal development - both participants and their students. Participation in the project also has a practical dimension. Teachers gain relevant competencies, so that their work becomes more efficient. This anticipated international cooperation is a great opportunity to exchange experiences and learn from each other, the development of communication skills, stimulate the development of others, as well as eliminating the complexes and prejudices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModern school must become an innovative organization, open to all novelties, looking at problems from different perspectives, sensitive to signals and challenges of the education market and ready to accept a variety of changes. Therefore, should develop their own innovations, providing professional management and creating an attractive environment for people who have desires to change reality.\r\n\r\nWe want our school to become more modern, more and more friendly and effective.

A significant proportion of our staff have never worked in another school and some have never been abroad. This project, which will link us with a Polish school near Warsaw, will widen everyone\u2019s horizons and open everyone\u2019s eyes to new ideas and possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe combination of a recent successful Ofsted Inspection (which celebrated many of our successes in raising achievement) and the introduction of the New National Curriculum has given us the impetus to look beyond the known and trusted and to seek new ways to build on our successes and to modernize and internationalise our curriculum.\r\n\r\nThrough the PIP Project we aim to fulfil many of the aspirations on our School Development Plan. Specifically, through the project we want to: develop our community links; introduce new and innovative teaching methods; develop pupils as independent learners; promote staff well-being; develop capacity for modern foreign language teaching and learning; and finally to develop ICT capability. \r\n\r\nTwelve staff  - teachers, support staff, and school leaders -will be directly involved in two visits to our partner school, but more staff will be involved in the preparatory activities, and all members of staff and children will benefit from the impact of the project and be involved in the reciprocal visits which our partner school is planning in a mirrored application.\r\n\r\nThe PIP Project will begin by developing links with the Polish school through E-Twinning. Staff and pupils will begin to get to know each other and project leaders will together plan the mobilities via the internet, ensuring that both partners understand each other\u2019s aims and contribute to each other\u2019s success.  \r\n\r\nThere will be two types of activities in the mobility part of the project: teaching assignments and staff training. All participants will be involved in both types of activity. \r\nFor teaching assignments, we will take innovative teaching practices, ideas and resources over to Poland and share these with staff and pupils there. \r\nStaff training will involve staff at every level job shadowing or observing their counterparts in selected activities and best practice situations. \r\n\r\nOn returning to England staff will contribute to the PIP digitally produced Journey wall and share their experiences in whole school assemblies and staff meetings.  New learning will be highlighted and integrated into daily practice.  Senior leaders will share their experiences more widely with other schools in the Maghull and District Community of Schools Partnership (MADCOS), encouraging others to engage in European activities.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that the project will immediately bring innumerable benefits both to staff and to the school as a whole. These will include enhanced knowledge and understanding of another European culture, language and educational system; knowledge of and ability to use new and innovative teaching methods and management approaches; and a highly motivated, more skilled, confident and reflective workforce. \r\n\r\n The PIP project will result in the school in the long-term being able to boast a modernized and internationalized curriculum and workforce as well as a community with a robust understanding of cultural and linguistic diversity.

We have since developed our relationship with the Polish school, hosting them twice in England and sending  six more staff to learn from them in Poland. This has had a huge impact on the development of the school as well as on individual staff. The SSS Project builds on the learning from the Partners In Poland Project and will take us to a new level in becoming an international school.We have set out a three year (2015 - 2018) European School Development Plan which encompasses our vision for the immediate future. Through the SSS project we aim to take significant steps towards fulfilling three of the main aspirations in this plan. Specifically, through the project we want to build capacity to develop and deliver a quality Modern Foreign Language programme, and also to promote staff well-being in order to maintain a strong professional profile. A longer term aim is to provide pupils with opportunities to deepen their knowledge and understanding of Spanish, and this we hope to fully achieve by organising pupil mobilities in a later project.The main activity funded by Erasmus+ will be structured training courses for Summerhill staff in Spain. Two groups of about seven, comprising both teaching and non-teaching staff, will commit part of their alloted school holidays to the week long training courses, which will be selected for their capacity to develop personal Spanish language skills AND Spanish teaching skills. Meanwhile, the school curriculum will be adjusted to include Spanish Language learning in Reception, Y1 and Y2 as well as in the Juniors, and all classes will be involved in making links with Spanish schools through eTwinning. The SSS Project will be led and managed by an Erasmus+ Management Group (E+MG) comprising a Governor, Headteacher, Languages Co-ordinator (who teaches in KS1) and the KS2 leader. This group will oversee all aspects of the project and ensure that the desired objectives are achieved as far as possible. We will be investing a lot of time and energy into this project and expect it to have a major impact on whole school development.The fully-immersive training and preparatory work will greatly enhance staff foreign language competence, raise staff awareness and understanding of Spain and the Spanish culture, and offer them the opportunity to build networks of international contacts. We also expect it to develop staff pedagogical knowledge so that they return with a clearer understanding of how to teach Spanish and how to respond to the needs of individual children in this subject.We know from previous experience with the PIP project that staff will also develop personally in terms of confidence and inter-personal skills, giving them improved capacity for promotion and greater job-satisfaction. From the excitement of learning a new language they may well see the benefits of lifelong learning and be enthused to seek and take other opportunities as they arise.Pupils will benefit from the project as their Language curriculum is dramatically improved and the school becomes bi-lingual in its approach. In the long term they will benefit from being involved in mobilities to Spain themselves and as generations of pupils receive an excellent languages education they will contribute to a more cohesive society and a more skilled and internationalised workforce.

Our school includes a sixth form and we also have very strong links with primary schools. Therefore to take a truly whole school approach to the embedding of internationalism, we need to involve staff from KS3 to KS5.\r\n\r\nWe aim to ensure that our pupils continue to be given a broad and rich education that will support their aspirations and not just be narrowly focused. We want to open up the curriculum to allow students to experience what is taught in schools across the world and examine how we can work collaboratively with schools in other countries. We want to bring learning to life by allowing students to discuss their learning with peers in other countries and learn from each other. We need to develop links and networks to do this.\r\nOur objectives for this project are very much based on our whole school objectives and our ethos of encouraging our pupils to consider themselves to be responsible members of a community both locally and globally.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, we aim to improve the standard of teaching across our school, offering our pupils more choice and a more rounded education. We want to learn from other schools across Europe and to encourage our pupils to develop a sense of global citizenship.\r\n\r\nWe will send 10 members of staff to Spain and 6 to France on structured training courses over a period of 2 years. Our courses include intensive language learning, cultural activities, teaching methodology sessions, the opportunity to spend time in a French/Spanish school and opportunities for professional discussion with colleagues about a range of MFL issues.\r\n\r\nTeaching staff from seven different departments and one member of the SLT will take part in this project, ensuring that the effects are felt by all students, and ensuring that the project is given the importance that it deserves.\r\n\r\nThe courses will enable existing MFL staff to develop their language skills and the confidence in methodology required to teach their second MFL. Staff from other departments will have the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the language and culture of another country and see how their subject is taught.\r\n\r\nThe spread of staff will ensure that the project is truly embedded throughout the school and upon completion of the project all staff members will have been involved.\r\n\r\nOur courses  will include;\r\n- intensive language learning,\r\n- cultural activities,\r\n- methodology sessions,\r\n- opportunity for discussion with fellow professionals about issues related to MFL,\r\n- the chance to make links with French/ Spanish schools and \r\n- for staff to spend time in these schools sharing practice and developing links.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the impact on our successful school will be widespread and long lasting, impacting on the staff who participate, non-participating staff, pupils, parents, SLT, Governors and the wider community.\r\n\r\nThere will be a dissemination school plan that lists the stakeholders to involve, the activities and the timeframe in which the activities and information sharing will take place.

During the week they will develop their confidence and improve their teaching expertise by teaching lessons to English classes. They will also job-shadow Spanish teachers in order to observe their methods and curriculum content so that they can gain a greater insight into the Spanish education system. Participants will also engage in cultural activities in order to gather resources and knowledge to add to the Spanish Curriculum at Summerhill.
