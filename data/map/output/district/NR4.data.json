In our latest OFSTED assessment our school was found to be good with a number of outstanding features.\r\n\r\nWe have traditionally offered a package of German and French at the school, and in response to the changing face of global commerce and feedback from parents wanting us to introduce Spanish, we have started to teach it as our third language. \r\n\r\nEach of the three languages have equal weighting in terms of teaching allocation, and we currently have both Y7 and Y8 learning Spanish. It has proven to be very popular; we have 8 groups learning Spanish in Y8 having chosen it along with another language at the end of Y7.\r\n\r\nHaving introduced Spanish as a third language and rolling it out at KS3 and KS4 we need to make an \"step change\" to upskill  teachers within the department in response. We have one Hispanic teacher within the department who has been instrumental in development of schemes of work for KS3 and who will lead the process at KS4.\r\n\r\nThis will be a two-year project involving the MFL Department. We would like to apply for mobility visits to Spain to support us to achieve our aims. We would like 14 mobilities in total which would enable seven members of the MFL Department to participate in two intensive immersion courses over two years. We need to rapidly up upskill these 7 staff to give them the skills and confidence to teach Spanish effectively to GCSE and to reach the levels necessary to teach A Level. We believe that immersion training will be by far the most effective way to achieve fast results.\r\n\r\nThe courses involve intensive language learning, cultural activities, the development of intercultural understanding, language learning methodology, pedagogy and discussions about various topics related to the teaching of languages. The course will give all participants the chance to spend time in a Spanish school, observing good practice and developing links. These placements will be organised by the course provider.\r\n\r\nThese courses will allow the MFL Department to continue to up skill in the face of an increasing cohort of students studying this language, responding directly to the student needs.\r\n\r\nLearning outcomes for participants in mobilities will be numerous. They will greatly benefit from the intensive nature of this training and the fact that they have the opportunity to return after a year to further consolidate and develop their learning. They will increase their language knowledge to the extent that they will feel confident to be able to meet the demands of GCSE Spanish.

Isoprene emissions are predicted to rise due to global warming and increased use of isoprene-emitting trees (oil palm, poplar) for biofuel production but almost nothing is known about its biogeochemical cycle.

Removal of germ cells extends somatic lifespan implying that reduced reproduction frees up resources for survival. Remarkably, however, the disruption of germline signalling increases lifespan without the obligatory reduction in fecundity, thus challenging the key role of the survival-reproduction trade-off. Recent breakthroughs suggest that protection and repair of the genome and the proteome of the germ cells is costly and compromised germline maintenance increases mutation rate, which can reduce offspring fitness. Thus, expensive germline maintenance can be a missing link in the puzzle of cost-free lifespan extension. This hypothesis predicts that when germline signalling is manipulated to increase investment into somatic cells, the germline maintenance will suffer resulting in increased mutation rate and reduced offspring fitness, even if total fecundity is unaffected. I propose a research program at the interface of evolutionary biology and biogerontology that focuses on phenotypic and evolutionary costs of germline maintenance. First, I will genetically manipulate germline signalling to boost investment into soma and estimate mutation rate and competitive fitness of the resulting offspring using Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Second, I will employ experimental evolution in nematodes to assess the long-term evolutionary costs of increased germline maintenance. Third, I will use germline transplantation in zebrafish Dario rerio to directly test whether germline proliferation reduces investment into soma in a vertebrate.

These ideas have been called into question by recent developments in behavioural economics, which point to the cognitive limitations of economic agents, the instability of preferences, and the existence of pro-social motivations.

I aim to develop an approach to normative economics, and a corresponding understanding of the role of markets, which do not require neoclassical rationality assumptions but may still support those presumptions.\n\nMy approach is innovative in two ways. First, the criterion for normative analysis is opportunity, not preference satisfaction.  Even if individuals lack coherent preferences, opportunities for mutually advantageous transactions can be defined in a normatively significant way, and competitive markets can be shown to be effective in providing such opportunities. Second, using a new version of the theory of \u2018team reasoning\u2019, the relationship between parties to a market transaction can be construed in terms of a joint intention to achieve mutual benefit.

Literary translation requires specific knowledge and skills: language proficiency, knowledge of the source and target culture, familiarity with the schools of thoughts in the source and target literature. They must also develop a specific literary language use and be able to handle different styles. These are but a few of the aspects of the (wide range of) knowledge and competencies  expected of a good literary translator. Proper training programmes are therefore very important.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETRA-E aims to set up a European infrastructure for the education and training of literary translators. This project is the first step in that direction; developing a Framework for the education and training of literary translators. The project  builds on several previous European and international initiatives. \r\n\r\nPETRA-E will follow the recommendations on the education of literary translators from the 2011 PETRA Congress: \r\n\r\n-Laying the foundation for a European infrastructure for the education and training of literary translators by further developing and disseminating a Framework of Reference for knowledge, skills and competencies in the area of literary translation. This is important for the recognition and validation of knowledge and skills acquired through the various formal and informal training programmes. \r\n\r\n- This requires implementation of another recommendation from the PETRA Congress: forums should be set up at a European level, since there is an urgent need for a debate on the recognition of skills, competencies and proficiency levels and for reaching consensus on the basis for a curriculum. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe education and training of literary translators is necessarily a small-scale matter; the literary translation market is a small one, and the number of possible language combinations is large (cf Dutch-Irisch, Irish-Hungarian). It is a fragmented field of university and non-university education programmes (many of which are offered by translators\u2019 organizations). The education and training of literary translators at university level is largely fragmented and invisible, since it forms part of various programmes for language studies.\r\n\r\nAlthough, in spite of all this, good results are being achieved, there is a lack of opportunities for cooperation, student and teacher exchange programmes, best practices and teaching methods. It is also not possible to move on to another type of education or to validate results achieved previously or elsewhere. Many opportunities for innovation, cooperation and cost savings therefore remain unused, while an increasing number of requirements is imposed on (the education and training of) translators. \r\n\r\nBecause the translation market is under pressure, translators must work under ever-increasing time constraints, and are expected to possess professional skills when they enter the labour market. The market is also undergoing more rapid changes, and it is important that the educational field can quickly respond to changes in demand. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nBecause of the diversity of training programmes and the different views on them, a choice was made for a broadly based project group, bringing together different types of schools, stakeholders and disciplines. This also increases the level of support for and the dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nDevelopment and dissemination go hand in hand in this project. In this context and due to the various views  stated, target groups should  already be involved at the instrument\u2019s development stage so that it can meet their expectations. Apart from the project partners, we will also involve other institutions and translators in the development of the Framework during the meetings.

Lipids are the most energy dense of macronutrients and excess consumption has been linked to obesity. Most people find it difficult to change their diets to eat healthily. Changes in food manufacturing are needed to develop healthier products and ingredients. Lipids are water insoluble and their breakdown in the digestive tract occurs at the fat/water interface so the composition at the fat interface can affect lipid digestion in vitro. If lipid digestion is controlled, energy release during digestion is prolonged and hyperlipidaemia, a CVD risk factor, reduced. Slowly-digested lipids can also increase satiety, control energy intake and help manage weight loss.

Processed food emulsions are stabilised by complex interfaces composed of proteins, emulsifiers and lipids. Lipase action is very sensitive to interfacial composition.

Leaves also display remarkable diversity in shape and form, with perhaps the most complex form being the pitcher-shaped (epiascidiate) leaves of carnivorous plants.  This form has evolved four times independently, raising the question of whether its seeming complexity may have arisen through simple modulations in underlying morphogenetic mechanisms.  To test this hypothesis, I aim to develop a model system for carnivorous plants based on Utricularia gibba (humped bladderwort), which has the advantage of having one of the smallest genomes known in plants (~2/3 the size of the Arabidopsis genome) and small transparent pitcher-shaped leaves amenable to imaging.

Our hypothesis is that different thermo-sensors monitor distinct aspects of the long-term temperature profile.

In plants, the cytoplasm of adjacent cells is connected by plasma membrane-line pores called plasmodesmata (PD) that cross the cell wall, generating cytoplasmic continuity between cells and tissues. This interconnected cytoplasm is termed the symplast and is unique to plants. In plants, growing evidence suggests that innate immune responses rely on regulation of symplastic connectivity. My group previously discovered that regulation of PD (whether they are open or closed) is critical for immune responses. Further, we have shown that pathogens suppress host regulation of PD in an effort to maintain symplastic continuity between cells. We don\u2019t know why the host regulates the symplast during defence: while data suggests that different defence responses might differently exploit the symplast, we don\u2019t understand how the symplast defines the success of a response.

What happens if such a challenge becomes more than transient? Meiosis is a well-suited model for understanding how a constrained multiprotein process can evolve; it is biochemically well characterized, critical for fertility in sexual eukaryotes, and its core structures and functions are conserved across kingdoms. Yet proteins that orchestrate meiosis often have high primary sequence divergence among taxa and in some cases have undergone selective sweeps. We hypothesize this pattern reflects a need to repeatedly retune meiotic structures to new conditions over evolutionary time. Environment and genome architecture can both affect meiosis, but a common and particularly potent challenge is whole genome duplication (WGD), which has occurred in most major eukaryotic lineages. But WGD doubles the number of copies of each homolog present, and this can lead to formation of multivalent chromosome associations in meiosis, which can cause meiotic instability and low fertility. Nevertheless, many fertile and meiotically stable polyploids exist, showing that evolution can overcome this challenge. Here we will study how meiotic stability evolved in autopolyploid Arabidopsis arenosa.

Legumes form symbiotic interactions with mycorrhizal fungi that aid in the uptake of phosphate and with nitrogen fixing rhizobial bacteria that provide the plant with a source of nitrogen in the form of ammonium. A better understanding of these symbiotic processes will provide opportunities to improve and expand these symbiotic interactions in important crop species, which could greatly enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. In both of these symbiotic interactions signal exchange between the plant and the symbiont is crucial for the establishment of the interaction. While these two symbioses initiate very different developmental responses in the plant, they share a common symbiosis signalling pathway, that is involved in the recognition of the symbiotic signalling molecules.

A central class of plant immune receptors, called Nucleotide Binding Leucine Rich Repeats proteins (NLR), has been implicated in recognition of vastly diverse pathogen-derived effector molecules. An emerging paradigm of receptor diversification in plant genomes involves new gene fusions of receptors with host proteins that are normally targeted by pathogen effectors. Such fusion receptors \u2018bait\u2019 pathogens and their integrated domains are thought to function as \u2018decoys\u2019 or \u2018sensors\u2019 that mediate pathogen recognition. I have recently demonstrated that the mechanism of generating new receptors through gene fusions originated at least 500 million years ago in mosses and is common to all flowering plants. Here, I propose to decode the mechanisms of plant immune receptor diversification by gene fusions by studying diversity and functions of immune receptors in grasses, a young highly diversified plant family that includes the three most important crops: maize, rice and wheat. My specific aims are to: \n\n1) Determine rates of receptor diversification within and across genomes. \n2) Dissect the mechanisms of receptor regulation and receptor activation. \n3) Generate novel plant immune receptors based on the NLR platform prone to fusions. \n\nIn this MIREDI research programme, I will combine state of the art sequencing techniques and bioinformatics, molecular biology and novel reverse genetics techniques to study how plant immune system co-evolves with pathogens and what limits diversification of immunity in domesticated crops.", 538643.0, 1309295.0, 1, 2, "MIREDI", null, "http://www.tsl.ac.uk", null, "h2020_208793_998398982"], [1267401600000, 1425081600000, "Linking the clock to metabolism", "John Innes Centre", "Optimal plant growth requires the orchestration of carbon metabolism over the day-night cycle, to avoid periods of starvation at night. Metabolism and growth at night are fueled by carbohydrates released by degradation of starch, synthesised from photosynthesis in the preceding day. Starch synthesis and degradation are regulated such that starch reserves are almost but not quite exhausted at the end of the night, in both long and short nights. We have recently found that this robust regulation is a function of the circadian clock, an endogenous timer that allows plants to anticipate and prepare for daily changes in their environment, and a paradigm for Systems Biology. The clock controls the rate of starch degradation at night, so that reserves last until the anticipated dawn. Starvation and growth arrest are avoided. This important discovery opens the way to new levels of understanding of the control of plant growth and productivity. TiMet assembles world leaders in experimental and theoretical plant Systems Biology to understand the regulatory interactions between the clock gene circuit and metabolism, and their emergent effects on growth and productivity.

Although SmartCell focuses on terpenoids, the largest class of secondary metabolites, which exhibit extremely diverse biological and pharmaceutical activities, all knowledge, tools and resources developed in the project, are generic and broadly applicable to engineer any plant biosynthetic pathway. A systems biology approach using metabolomics and transcriptomics is taken to move beyond the state of the art. New multigene transfer technologies are developed. By screening and functionally categorizing genes at structural, regulatory and transport levels a comprehensive knowledge base of how secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways operate in plants is developed. The case study component i.e. manufacturing a valuable terpenoid in an optimized large-scale system gives SmartCell a unique opportunity to directly make transition from fundamental science to application.

In many plant species, variations in leaf shape and size between juvenile and adult leaves accompany the acquisition of reproductive competence. This is termed heteroblasty. The canonical molecular pathway controlling heteroblasty has been recently described. It is topped by miR156, a miRNA which acts as a master switch to prevent the adult behaviour through the repression of transcription factors. However, the way how these genes control the growth patterns by which heteroblastic forms arise remains unknown. In this project, I propose to study the dynamics of heteroblasty establishment in Arabidopsis, by combining the knowledge acquired in molecular biology on the control of heteroblasty with the expertise on modelling of leaf growth in the host group (Prof. Enrico Coen and Prof. Andrew Bangham).\nPreliminary results suggest that the heteroblastic changes in leaf shape are ruled by the miR156 pathway until a certain leaf developmental stage, while the changes in leaf size are conditional on plant\u2019s capacity to exploit its environmental resources. To test this hypothesis, I will i) use a modelling platform developed in the host group to compare quantitatively the early growth pattern of leaf 6 (adult) with the one of leaf 1 (juvenile), ii) develop an inducible line to analyze and model the spatiotemporal effects of the miR156 pathway in these early growth patterns, iii) modify the environment during leaf 6 development to analyze the plasticity of this leaf, and iv) analyze and disturb the expression of miR156 during leaf 6 development to question the involvement of the miR156 pathway in the control of final shape and size of this leaf.\nThrough a combination of developmental, physiological and modelling approaches, this integrative analysis of heteroblasty will generate fundamental knowledge on leaf growth, a key target for breeding robust crops within a changing world.'", 182265.0, 182265.0, 1, 1, "HEMOTIONAL", null, "http://www.jic.bbsrc.ac.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/201407261252.jpg", "fp7_107264_999992595"], [1362355200000, 1425340800000, "Metabolic engineering of triterpenoid pathways involved in plant defense in Arabidopsis and rice", "John Innes Centre", "'Plants produce a diversity array of natural products (otherwise known as secondary metabolites) that have important ecological functions (Dixon 2001; Field and Osbourn 2008).

The aim of this project is to understand in more detail the efficiency of soil nitrate use at the molecular level using the wealth of knowledge, tools and resources available in Arabidopsis. The research plan is based on work in the host laboratory showing a genetic link between the amounts of available photosynthate, nitrate transporter gene expression, nitrate uptake and growth. Physiologically this involves the plant balancing nitrate acquisition from the soil with carbon metabolites for amino acid biosynthesis. This balance directly influences growth in response to nitrate and is a potential control point. However, the molecular mechanisms need to be understood in more detail in order that the knowledge can be used to breed new crop varieties that use nitrate more efficiently. The project involves a genetic screen to identify genes that influence the levels and activity of key nitrate transporter in response to available sugar. Another screen of transcription factors that bind to and activate the transporter gene will also be conducted.
