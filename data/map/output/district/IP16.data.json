The need for innovative irrigated systems is to minimize water consumption and costs. Also in times of limited water the project will be lucrative.\nThere are more and more increasing cost pressures like costs of water, energy and fertilizer, environmental legislation and requirements, cuts of subsidies, high personal costs etc. The project will help to save a huge amount of money by reducing the mentioned investments.\nThe tendency to automatic systems in the agriculture is rising and in future farmers will do most of their regulating by a computer. The system will support the farmers to realize their work by modern technology.\nFurthermore the project minimizes the pollution of groundwater by reducing fertilizer to a limit and concerns of eutrophication will be decreased.\nThe aim of the project is to develop a fully automatic irrigation and fertilisation system (with needs based fertilizer spreading) in order to help farmers to monitor and control their water and fertilizer consumption. That basically means we want to combine the irrigation and fertilization in one step. Furthermore, the system will diagnose the need of\nthe plants with the help of sensors and the interpretation of terrestrial meteorological data. The system consists of a combined sensor-detector-dosage system, which\nincludes a monitoring, control and distribution unit which enables the dosing and distribution of the water and the fertilizer.'", 239371.0, 1568914.0, "OPTIFERT", "Automated irrigation helps the environment", "Over the last decade the use of irrigation systems has grown significantly; however, inefficient systems cause water and fertiliser to be wasted. An EU-funded initiative addressed this problem with the aim of enabling farmers to carefully monitor and control their use of these resources.", "At present, more than 9 million European farmers irrigate an area of land the size of Greece, or 4.5\u00a0% of the whole EU territory. In the future, these lands are expected to be subject to longer dry periods as result of climate change. Therefore, the use of irrigation will continue to increase.\n\nThe 'Development of an automatic irrigation and fertilization system' (http://www.optifert.eu (OPTIFERT)) project worked to find a solution to the problem. The consortium developed an innovative automated irrigation system for medium- and large-scale farms. The system combines fertilisation and irrigation in one step, and reflects a growing trend in which computers allow farmers to monitor water and fertiliser consumption more easily.\n\nThe system comprises a soil sensor, data processor, and a control and distribution unit, which monitors key soil parameters and crop needs in real time. Control software can access databases on growth information relevant to different crops and soil data (type, structure and fertility), and economic data regarding costs and prices. Weather forecasts can also be obtained and fed into the system. In addition, the user can add data, such as information on crops and planting times.\n\nData can be gathered to determine the correct dose of water and fertiliser for each growth stage of the crop. This will reduce the amount of these valuable resources used by farmers, thereby reducing environmental impacts, such as groundwater pollution and eutrophication of water bodies.\n\nThe OPTIFERT system will also enable farmers to save money by reducing energy usage, and help to ensure compliance with environmental legislation and requirements. In addition, it will help Europe's agricultural sector to become more competitive in the global market place.", "http://www.optifert.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015-06/148741.jpg", "fp7_102286_960896454"], ["4QW", "Safe and efficient treatment and reuse of wastewater in agricultural production schemes", "Soil Moisture Sense Ltd", "TREAT&USE project aims to bring together 6 European SMEs and one RTD to prove and disseminate the technical and economic viability of a method for safe and economic wastewater treatment that allows a direct reuse of the water and nutrients in agricultural production with minimal operational and maintenance costs.\nTREAT&USE is based on the outcomes of two successful finished EU research projects: PURATREAT and WACOSYS on wastewater treatment, reuse technologies and fertigation systems. The produced technical and scientific results of both projects were excellent and very promising in terms of energy and cost efficiency. The most promising MBR system developed in PURATREAT run successfully with reduced energy consumption ( 90 % less than RO). The tested MBR lab-prototypes generated an effluent not suitable for drinking water but an excellent source for irrigation and fertilization purposes (rich on nutrients such as N and P and free of pathogens). In WACOSYS, the application of wastewater in agricultural production schemes has been successfully applied and monitored. Based on these valuable outcomes, within TREA&USE is planned to construct and implement a pre-commercial prototype unit which combines the treatment of substantial amounts of communal wastewater in an up scaled MBR system and the safe application of the effluent as irrigation and fertilization water in agricultural production schemes. The tailor-made MBR effluent will be applied directly for irrigating and fertilizing fruit trees and vegetables in commercial agricultural production site in Southern Spain. To measure the performance and the reliability of the approach, the pre-commercial prototype will include a feedback and control unit based on soil sensors.
