For that, it applies a twofold strategy: 1)persuades users to increase their energy-awareness and change their e-consumption habits and 2)embeds intelligence in the devices to let them autonomously decide about their operation mode for energy efficiency purposes. For the first part, it will use a variety of techniques, from persuasive social applications to physical interaction mechanisms linked to the devices. For the second part, it will learn from the usage habits, acting only when an energy wasteful behaviour is detected or the users do not heed the devices\u2019 suggestions. The aim is to add a green-soul to devices in a pluggable manner to avoid costly replacement of equipment and the corresponding disposal of old-fashioned devices to the landfill.\n \nGreenSoul\u2019s exploitation potential is addressed towards buildings of public use. There, the persuasion of users is particularly challenging since they hardly perceive the benefits of having eco-friendly behaviour, i.e. they do not pay the electricity bill. GreenSoul will design and develop an integrated ICT platform to: a) improve users awareness of their energy consumption habits; b)study the ecological behaviour of the people in shared environments; c)analyse the effectiveness of different persuasion techniques; d)assist users through a decision-support engine\u2019s recommendations; and e)provide socio-economic evidence about the viability of the changes proposed.\n \nGreenSoul aims to prove that combined behavioural and ICT interventions over public buildings result in energy savings which surpass 20%.

Some study two languages at A-level. It is mandatory that students study at least one at GCSE level. The first objective of the project is that the participant raises the level of her Spanish skills so that she would have the capacity to teach Spanish to A-level students. The nine members of the MFL department at the school  all strive to ensure students achieve their potential and this project's second objective is to extensively contribute to raising the profile of Spanish and other languages, and to impart cultural knowledge to students. Upon completing the course, the teacher would share the experience with students: this would enable them to gain an understanding and appreciation of the benefits that learning a language both in the UK and abroad can bring. Lastly, this project aims to develop links with European teachers and share teaching practices.The activities undertaken during the course would include group classes, individual classes and cultural activities organised by the language school. Whilst carrying out the course, the teacher would form links with other European schools and share teaching practices and learning strategies through meeting teachers attending the same course. This would have long term benefits for the school and its students and increase opportunities for students to gain experiences abroad.The project would involve evaluation stages before, during and after completion of the course. Expectations of the course's outcomes would be established prior to departing and misconceptions that may arise would be addressed during the course. This teacher would expect to make progress in all levels of her Spanish, and build on skills she has acquired over the years. Self-assessment would play a key role in assessing language proficiency and progress. The language school would also assist in monitoring the participant's progress. Upon completion of the course, progress that had been made would be measured through written and speaking tests.The results of the progress that the teacher had made would be gathered using data from language tests and self evaluation forms.  In order to gain information on Spanish culture, interviews with native Spanish teachers would be recorded in the target language, which could be imparted and played to students. Interviews with teachers from other European countries would also be made in order to gain insight into other teaching and learning strategies: these would be shared with other members of the department. The impact of these results would serve to raise the attainment of French and Spanish in the MFL department, impart cultural knowledge to students and assist the department and the wider school in implementing different different teaching and learning strategies. The participant intends to share experiences and impart knowledge through discussing and sharing teaching approaches and learning strategies with her colleagues. Since links with European schools would be made, the longer term benefits of this project would be enhanced through collaborating with other European teachers in order to promote language learning and share practices.

In schools today ICT is rather used for the development of lower than higher level skills of students, and innovative practices in schools are fragmented and do not provide systemic approach to schooling in technology rich learning environment. \r\nExperience and variety of social habits of contemporary students - digital natives - today is formed and shaped both in the real and virtual environment and they radically change didactics and organization of the processes in schools, individual activities and development of competences. Transformation of traditional schooling, by merging on-line and off-line learning experiences of students, is crucial for competitiveness of education reducing the gap between academic achievements and real life needs. \u201c\u2026 the main challenge, including for the most advanced education systems, lies in teachers\u2019 capacities to use technology effectively in the classroom.\u201d (UNESCO 2011)\r\nThe Project \u201cB-Learning: Curriculum Design for Blended Learning\u201d (B- Learning) aims to provide resources and training for school teams how to transform traditional schooling by combining on-line and off-line teaching - learning experiences. In this process teachers should become the main motivators and initiators of the ICT implementation and agents of change from the classical method into the modern one which is also known as blended learning (BL). \r\nThe project objective is in line with \u2018Europe 2020\u2019 Strategy promoting synergies of experience and know-how among four EU countries and different types of institutions involved in education and training. The BE-Learning project will be implemented by 6 project partners from Latvia, Austria, Cyprus and UK.\r\nThe project direct target group will be 3-5 leadership team members from 5 schools in each partner country, about 100 persons. Indirect target groups will include teachers and students, teacher trainers and policy decision makers.  \r\nThe main project outcomes will be: 1) Needs Analysis Report; 2) BE-Learning Toolkit; 3) Trained school teams.  \r\nThe desired impact of the project is increased national and European understanding of blended learning and purposeful integration of ICT in schooling.

Implicit within the project title is the question of how to address difference in a positive and affirmative way.  Through collaborative working, students will have opportunities to learn more about other cultures, not just from those who are born and bred within Europe, but from those who have become European citizens for a variety of reasons, such as war, persecution or poverty. Through this collaboration their minds will be opened to the value of diversity, and thus borders will be broken down and become unimportant.  \r\n\r\nAlongside these intentions is the belief that students need to be truly ready for the digital world in which they will live and work as adults, and the project approaches this from the point of view of embedding '21st Century Skills'.  The starting point is the video 'Shift Happens' (https://youtu.be/emx92kBKads).   This highlights the importance of ensuring the young people have a range of skills, be they cultural, physical and/or intellectual, with which to approach the 21st century way of life.\r\n\r\nThe project will take the format of transnational project meetings of 3-5 days to prepare activities for a student exchange which will take place approximately six weeks later.  The six co-ordinators and subject specialists will meet in the host country to plan activities focused around specific topics, such as digital media, drama, the environment, history and politics, vocational education, languages and the use of ICT.  A range of innovative and focused activities will be planned.  \r\n\r\nOn returning to their schools, the co-ordinator and the subject specialist will work with a group of students to research and prepare for the exchange week.  Each exchange week will have an outcome, such as a documentary, a piece of devised drama, a research project.  In this way, students will have opportunities to look more closely at the concept of 'borders' and how to remove them, whilst at the same time developing a range of 21st century skills.  The project will also enable both students and teachers to learn more about other countries and their cultural, political, social, religious and philosophical approaches, and they will have opportunities to meet new people, improve communication skills and generally broaden their outlook.  In this respect we believe the project will be enriching for all.  2-3 of the students (more if self-funded) will then visit the host school to deliver the project to the other partners.\r\n\r\nEach phase of the project will be thoroughly evaluated and the results published in a teacher's handbook, which will be disseminated via the internet, conferences, seminars and workshops, inset, assemblies and presentations to the partners' schools, local, national and international schools and other stakeholders, thus ensuring thorough dissemination, impact and sustainability beyond the end of the funding period.", "http://www.bennett.kent.sch.uk", "Bennett Memorial Diocesan School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036689_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TN4"}
