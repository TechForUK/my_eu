It accounts for 40% of deaths in the EU and costs the EU economy almost \u20ac196bn each year. 2D ultrasound scans are currently the primary choice for vascular diagnostics. Due to low sensitivity, a limited field of action and the lack of volume information, patients are often referred for CTa, MRa and catheter angiography for the detailed imaging required for diagnosis and treatment planning. Referrals delay treatment, exposes the patient to risks associated with radiation and contrast mediums and increases costs. This presents a need to improve the speed and safety of the diagnosis of vascular conditions for rapid treatment, as well as to improve workflow efficiency and reduce costs. The project consortium will further develop the piur tUS system, a 3D freehand tomographic US system capable of rapid, safe and accurate reconstructive 3D quantifiable vascular imaging. It will provide a low cost and reproducible imaging solution that will reduce the need for referrals and be an effective preventative screening tool for CVD. We aim to complete and publish the results from 4 CVD clinical studies to generate the clinical evidence required for CE marking and clinical validation for market uptake. The 4 clinical applications studied will provide a solution for conditions most frequently referred for detailed 3D imaging to maximise the cost-benefit to clinics of purchasing the piur tUS system. The project consortium combines piur imaging\u2019s expertise in medical device development and commercialisation with 3D imaging specialist ImFusion GmbH and medical device product development and manufacturing experts ACMIT.

These mobilities will involve structured training courses focused on intensive language learning, cultural immersion, primary teaching methodology and the opportunity to make a link with a school in Spain allowing our children to have regular contact with native speakers of their own age.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will be taken by the Languages Subject Leader, the Head Teacher, and two other members of staff.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living.

We are proud of the developments that the previous project has enabled us to achieve, and would like to use a second project to continue to build upon these successes.\r\n\r\nStaff confidence in teaching languages is developing and, through the support of the more confident teachers, we are in the process of encouraging all staff members to be involved in language teaching. We feel that there is more scope to develop linguistic and intercultural skills to an even higher level, particularly upon evaluation of the success of the previous project, and from the positive involvement from staff members.\r\n\r\nAs a school, we feel it is very important to capitalise on the success of the previous project so that the school continues to benefit from the impact.
