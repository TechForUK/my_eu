Understanding how best to configure and re-configure a global production network, set against rapidly changing product-service requirements is one such complex problem area. This project aims to provide services that support the design and provision of flexible interoperable networks of production systems that can rapidly and accurately be re-configured. The metaphor employed is \u2018to start with an new business idea in the morning and have all required data and networks understood by the afternoon\u2019\n\nTo achieve this FLEXINET takes the view that new product-service global production network modelling methods and models are needed that can model business cases and identify the critical network relations and knowledge that underlies the business operation. In addition, FLEXINET takes the fundamental view that complex manufacturing systems which involve multiple partners and multiple complex network constraints,  require a semantically rigorous formal foundation upon which to base the flexible re-configuration of global production networks.\n\nBased on the exploitation of these technologies, FLEXINET will deliver a set of configuration services for flexible network design, applicable to both OEMs and SMEs, that will enable 'what-if' comparisons of costs, risks, configuration evaluations and product-service compliance requirements for alternative production network designs. FLEXINET will achieve this aim by working with its industrial partners from the industrial pump, white goods and food sectors and exploiting the world leading expertise of its partners in business modelling, business evaluation methods, risk management, manufacturing semantics, manufacturing knowledge sharing, manufacturing eco-systems, product-service systems, SME collaboration, SOA, Interoperability and standardisation.'", 256435.0, 3995087.0, "FLEXINET", null, null, null, null, "http://www.control2k.co.uk", null, "fp7_108887_997361470"], ["3WT", "Future Internet Technologies for MANufacturing", "Sematronix Limited", "According to the 2010 EC Competitiveness Report, Manufacturing is still the driving force of Europe's economy, contributing over \u20ac 6553 billion in GDP and providing more than 30 million jobs.

Secondary aluminium recycling and ceramic processing were identified as key examples with economically recoverable waste heat.

The Smartrec system meets these challenges by development of a standard, modular solution for integration of heat recovery with thermal storage that valorises medium to high grade waste heat, adaptable to different temperatures and industries. Following end-user analysis and characterisation of exhaust streams and waste products, full life cycle costing and assessment will be carried out with candidate molten salts selected for thermal storage and heat transfer fluid, validated by corrosion testing.

The overall aim of the project is to develop and demonstrate technologies and processes for efficient and cost effective heat recovery from industrial facilities in the temperature range 70 oC to 1000 oC and the optimum integration of these technologies with the existing energy system or for over the fence export of recovered heat and generated electricity if appropriate.  To achieve this challenging aim, and ensure wide application of the technologies and approaches developed, the project brings together a very strong consortium comprising of RTD providers, technology providers and more importantly large and SME users who will provide demonstration sites for the technologies. The project will focus on two-phase innovative heat transfer technologies (heat pipes-HP) for the recovery of heat from medium and low temperature sources and the use of this heat for; a) within the same facility or export over the fence; b) for generation of electrical power; or a combination of (a) and (b) depending on the needs.

Thus companies looking for manufacturing capacity need to be supported by the means to find these capacities, configure them, and integrate them into their own manufacturing processes.\nTo achieve this, one obvious approach is to port successful concepts from the field of Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS) and Cloud computing to manufacturing to mirror agile collaboration through flexible and scalable manufacturing processes: \n\u2022 Leasing and releasing manufacturing assets in an on-demand, utility-like fashion.\n\u2022 Rapid elasticity through scaling leased assets up and down if necessary.\n\u2022 Pay-per-use through metered service.\nApplying these principles, Cloud manufacturing can move manufacturing processes from production-oriented to service-oriented networks by modelling single manufacturing assets as services in a similar way as SaaS or PaaS solutions.

The Welsh government has funded these posts and have developed policies and strategies across a number of sectors (including education) in order to increase the number of fluent Welsh speakers in Wales. The Basque country has faced similar problems to Wales in that they have seen a significant decrease in the number of people who can speak Basque, over recent centuries, and have successfully increased the number of fluent speakers to 32% (in 2011), compared to previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The most recent census in Wales saw a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers (down from 21% in 2001 to 19% in 2011), there is an opportunity here (in terms of added value) to share practices, methods, policies, strategies and for two countries with similar linguistic backgrounds to be able to support each other to develop within the Further Education sector.
