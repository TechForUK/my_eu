As a non-governmental organisation the BOF aims to improve the practical skills of young and senior environmental conservationists in order to enhance the successful employment of this special target group. Many of the Foundation\u2019s ongoing programmes are addressing recent, sectoral challenges such as the lack of hands-on trainings and linguistic skills. During the course of these partnership projects the BOF pinpointed several areas where adult education staff ought to be trained to become more efficient and more competent trainers. In this project the BOF intends to reinforce its adult education capacity through a) the modernisation of the pedagogical methodology in adult education, and through b) the development of adult education staff in the field of entrepreneurship. To achieve these objectives this programme will select 16 volunteers and/or professional trainers who are active in environmental adult education. The 16 participants will take part in a combined training which comprises a preparation phase in Hungary and a two week long tailor-made training course in the UK, hosted by Ambios Ltd. The preparatory training in Hungary will provide the participants with sufficient preliminary information on the four selected learning outcomes:\r\n\r\n1) New approaches and pedagogical views in adult education, skills and competencies\r\n2) The concept of organic life-long learning for adult learners\r\n3) The development of linguistic toolset (technical English course)\r\n4) Entrepreneurship in the environmental sector           \r\n \r\nThe learning topics will be actively discussed, demonstrated and experienced in depth during the course of the English training. Formal and informal teaching will deliver the learning content in English. The project duration is 12 months. Ambios Ltd (UK), the host organisation, has more than 20 years of experience in environmental and adult education.  \r\nThe most important expected impact of the project is that the beneficiaries will be more capable trainers because of the up to date knowledge (in methodology of adult education and entrepreneurship) which the project will provide. The entrepreneur thinking is regarded as a key competence to reduce the vulnerability of employees and career starters in such professions where employment prospects are not great. Hence, as a long term impact this project hopes to foster self-employment and entrepreneurship in the environmental sector. As a short term effect the Barn Owl Foundation intends to increase its weight in the environmental adult education with the help of the volunteers and staff as they develop their professional knowledge in adult education.", "http://www.ambios.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-HU01-KA104-013125_1"], ["1DJ", "Conservation and Rural Employability", "Ambios Ltd", 6331.0, "CARE, Conservation and Rural Employability, is a joint UK : Portugal project that aims to widen participation in youth volunteering to 2 young people suffering isolation in rural Madeira, Portugal.

Provide a period of \u2018real work\u2019 experience for wildlife identification, survey and interpretation skills VET trainees to increase their skills, confidence and employability via a mobility to a European wildlife organisation \r\n2. Ensure that this period of European experience is of relevance to the trainee and is certificated \r\nthrough our Wildlife Survey and Interpretation Skills ECVET curriculum\r\n3. Provide trainees with sufficient time and support to increase language skills and key competencies including: species identification, tracking and surveying, camera-trapping, bird ringing, live interpretation for different audiences (schools, families, public, specialists), team working and communication.\r\n5.

The Erasmus+ programme supports this education objective and the focus on sustainable development through its employment and social responsibility priorities.  The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  These SDGs provide a focus for 193 countries to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure its peoples enjoy peace & prosperity.  \r\nA 2017 report to the European Parliament on EU action for sustainability identified: \"\u2026that education and training are key to setting society on the path to sustainability \u2026 and that \u201cMember States [should] step up their efforts to implement sustainability education at all levels and in all forms of education and training\u201d.\r\nMuch activity within EU Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) that relate to the SDGs is implicit (implied or understood but not plainly or directly expressed) in its linkage.
