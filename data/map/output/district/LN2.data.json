The project will attain and exceed the ACARE targets for 2020 and will be going beyond the CO2 reductions to be achieved by on-going FP6 and FP7 programmes including Clean Sky:\n1.) CO2: minus 50% per passenger kilometre by 2020, with an engine contribution of 15 to 20%, 2.) NOx: minus 80% by 2020 and 3.) Reduce other emissions: soot, CO, UHC, SOx, particulates.\nThe major technical subjects to be addressed by the project are:\n1.) Innovative compressor for the ultra-high pressure ratio cycle (OPR 70) and associated thermal management technologies, 2.) Combustor-turbine interaction for higher turbine efficiency & ultra-high OPR cycles, 3.) Low NOx combustion systems for ultra-high OPR cycles, 4.) Advanced structures to enable high OPR engines & integration with heat exchangers, 5.) Reduced cooling requirements and stiffer structures for turbo-machinery efficiency, 6.) HP/IP compressor stability control.\nThe first four subjects will enable the engine industry to extend their design space beyond the overall pressure ratio of 50, which is the practical limit in the latest engines. Rig testing is required to validate the respective designs as well as the simulation tools to be developed.  The last two subjects have already been researched on the last two subjects by NEWAC.

This, and the fact that sometimes workers have greater possibilities of finding a job abroad, make that European Citizens today are more likely to leave their own country in order to study or work in other EU countries than before. People are often compelled to move in order to follow the changes in the labour market, as some fields of work may be better developed in another country or there may be a lack of workers in a specific sector. Therefore, workers specialized in those areas are more likely to be successful abroad.\r\n\r\nDriven by this necessity a person undergoing education or training should be aware of the situation and the opportunities of the European labour market. Teachers need to be able to transmit this new European dimension. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project of the Consortium 'Your ticket for Europe' aims to facilitate mobility for learners, teachers and staff in VET in  order to give them an international experience of high quality.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that students involved in mobility  are provided with all the tools they need in order to explore their chances of finding a job abroad.

In addition, apprentices and teachers of the social department at the RvW college will closely work together on this project. Whereas apprentices will practice the new resource orientated view from children with the help of observation and documentation sheets, teachers will discuss this issue with teachers and tutors from European partner institutions to obtain fresh ideas for the tuition and training of their students in Germany (A1, A2). \r\nIn the BA department activities include the exchange of experiences between two teams of VET staff and the students\u2019 tutors in the host companies with the aim of benefitting from synergy (e.g. cross curricular European projects) in both main subjects of the BA department (English and BA), thus enhancing the specific profile of the department.\r\nThe close link between the students` and teachers` mobility serves to guarantee the project`s quality by the following aspects: the teachers` interchange of possible concepts as regards a child`s individual promoting or the concept of a WLB respectively is structured in the same way as are the students` internships, namely through specific tasks (called \u201cAgenda\u201d) and its results are meant to help improve class teaching and the didactic structure of the departments.

All elements are of significant importance to society and  the idea of participation supports the RvW-BK strategy of \u201cinternationalization\u201d.  This project builds on the European work of the participating disciplines and it is an integral part of the school quality management system.  The project offers the participants insights into the concept of \u201cinternationalization\u201d and broadens the base for \u201cEurope-work\u201d at the Rvw-BK.  Currently the project has the following enrollment: 18 participants focusing on business studies and modern languages preparation with additional qualification as bilingual secretary; 34 participants doing a three-year-course in Health and Social Care / Childcare training to be nursery nurses  and 4 participants focusing on wholesale/retail and industrial management.  These participants are scheduled to attend a 4/8 week internship in a European country.  Additionally, there will be 22 staff/faculty members attending a three-day- mobility-phase  in the respective countries.  For the first time, faculty from the technical disciplines will also be in attendance. The goal of this faculty-mobility-activity is to initiate a co-operation with European partners, which will in turn enable 2 students to participate in the placements in phase two.\r\nThe project content has been further developed from the last year\u2019s project.  The content addresses discipline-specific topics.  For the pedagogic field, the placement focus is on the current discussion \u201cchange of pedagogic philosophies and their impact on early child development\u201d.  The new philosophy changes the understanding of the teacher\u2019s role in relation to the child.  The teacher takes the role of \u201cthe one learning from the child\u201d, aiming to support the child in their development and learning process by involving them in decisions based on their current capabilities.  The project goal is to examine this question through a European lens.  To do so, the participants will observe and practise the methods and processes during their placement.  The faculty will learn from their peers and bring back impulse to improve faculty development.  Both activities will be linked closely to obtain the best possible results. This project goal is in line with the RvW-BK European partnership work.\r\nIn the discipline of business administration and economics, the focus is on \u201cwork-life-balance\u201d (WLB) and how one attains this while participating in career, family and social activities.  The participants will study existing work-time models and develop recommendations based on their findings.  The study will have the following elements:  interviews of peers and supervisors with the aid of questionnaires; discussions with supervisors about economic and demographic challenges in their host country; analysis of the differences in WLB expectations by age group and with reference to the various work-time models and comparison of their findings in the host country to those of students who did their work placements in Germany.\r\nThe faculty members of the technical departments will focus on interactive teaching structures at the partnering facilities, preferably with heterogeneous learning groups that are aiming to improve and  self-learning.\r\nThe close linkage between student placement and faculty visits guarantees the quality of the project.  Structured activities and tasks (\u201cAGENDA\u201d) bring it all together.  The results will help to improve the teaching and didactic structures of each discipline.

Following a successful staff project in 2016/17 at Alfa College where 2 people from Construction were able to explore the delivery and assessment of Construction and Civils programmes, liaising with employers and working with partners to arrange a student project. The proposed project for 2017-19 will enable 10 Level 3 full-time Construction Civils students each year to undertake a 10 day visit to The Netherlands at Alfa College. The aim is the enhancement of the  primary learning goal and to support personal development and employability. Participants will attend college with their Dutch peers, make site visits and visit cultural locations.\r\n\r\n3. To share and disseminate the project outcomes to a wide audience, locally, nationally and internationally. The Lincoln College Groups Mission  is to be 'employer led, producing a highly skilled and productive work force'. By disseminating the outcomes of the activities to employers and other interested parties such as the Greater Lincolnshire LEP participants will be responsive to their priorities in relation to Health and Social Care provision, to contributing to the creation of extra homes and to transport infrastructure within the area.\r\nNot only will this information be shared locally but internationally with our international partners in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and China.\r\nDissemination will be via college social media formats; twitter, face book etc. publications such as the College Group Strategy 2016-19, prospectus etc. Information about all activities will be shared with the local press. These actions will be carried out by the college's Marketing Department. Other forms of dissemination will be explored throughout the duration of the project.\r\n\r\nDissemination and the sharing of results and good practice will also contribute to this process. A working relationship is already established with 2 Mobility Charter Colleges - Leeds City and Craven Colleges to share outcomes etc. It is further anticipated that regular meetings with other Charter holders in conjunction with the National Agency will enable further dissemination.\r\n\r\n4.

This will involve two staff members to  visit a new partner in the first year of this project. The visit will explore issues in respect of placement location, accommodation, supervision whilst in the country, all other aspects relating to 'safeguarding' etc. It is then anticipated that future funding applications for projects commencing in 2018 for full-time learners and apprentices in a range of vocational areas.\r\n\r\nThe project will run for two repetitive academic years between September 2017 and May 2019 in continued support of consistency and quality of practice. All full-time learners and apprentices will be subject to selection, attend all training sessions, be recommended by their employers/tutors. The outcomes for each of the participants will contribute to the assessment of their primary vocational learning aim, plus their own personal development and progression either into further training or employment.\r\nCare students and apprentices will undertake their placement in the spring of each year and  Childcare students in April. The timing of the two week project for Construction students is yet to be finalise, but it is anticipated that travel will be in the spring of each year. \r\nThe staff visit to Spain will  be carried out in the autumn of 2017.

We wish to work out common solutions and methods of motivating and activating students in a music school, supporting them in making great efforts in order to combine numerous school duties with an attempt to develop their own passions and interests, not forgetting about a high level of their general comprehensive education. We believe that would contribute to reducing the problem of school drop-outs, which is undoubtedly connected with students failures at meeting all the expectations from the teachers, attending all additional music classes and some other after-school activities and keeping high results from external tests in general education. Many students find combining both curricula extremely difficult, which often results in students changing school (leaving the music school and going to a general comprehensive school).\r\nFinding ways for tightening the cooperation between teachers following both curricula could undoubtedly help in reducing the problem. Effective cooperation between teachers, students and their parents may be a great support for the students in their attempts to fulfil all the duties and meet all the expectations.\r\nAdditionally, the teachers will be able to enhance and develop their European perspective, which will enable our staff to raise the European awareness in our pupils. The project will also aim at embedding the European and global dimension within the school's curriculum. Moreover, observing the methods and forms of managing an artistic school may directly influence and modify the methods of successful school managing.\r\nIn order to achieve the above mentioned goals, our teachers will visit the hosting school and take part in the course it will provide. The selected group of teachers will take part in a 6-day course organized by the partner school. The course will include: lesson observation, school work observation (both in artistic and regular school), lectures, seminars, practical workshops and running lessons under the supervision of the training teacher. \r\nThe participants of the project are all highly-qualified teaching staff with a long-standing working experience. They are a representative group of teachers following both curricula and working at all stages of education (primary and secondary) and their headmaster. They are all open to new methods and solutions and they all need constant development and training as well as improving their professional workshop. They need external stimuli and some other, new perspective in order to expand their workshop and learn new teaching methods and techniques of motivating students, especially those concerning working with artistically talented students. Their additional goal is to enhance their language competence in English. Moreover, the school headmaster would like to compare and expand his experience in managing an artistic school, by visiting a similar school in England.\r\nAfter the course ends, all participants will share the acquired knowledge and skills with all the teaching staff in and outside their departments as well as with the local environment by sharing their teaching experience. The gained skills will be used to plan, create and carry out new original teaching programmes and teaching innovations. The participation in the project will allow a better organization of the teaching and learning process in our school and working out new methods of motivating students, as well as increase the foreign language competence of the participating teachers. It will influence the progress of the school, which will now be perceived as a developing institution in the local environment.

Through SEITI we gained invaluable expertise in European project planning and management and enhanced the school atmosphere and staff cohesion as well as school quality in terms of safety knowledge and awareness, new and more inclusive teaching methodologies, a reduced failure rate and increased staff and student language interest.\r\nHowever, this is not the finish line, but just a new starting point since we are perfectly aware of our enormously important responsibility to our students, their families and society as a whole. Thus, aware of our strengths, we have carried out an unbiased and in-depth analysis of our weaknesses and outlined a new European ITInerary to address them adequately.\r\nThe LUF objectives are fully consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy: as a macro-target, we aim to continue on our path towards innovation and internationalization. In more detail:\r\n1. Traditionally, we have trained highly specialised technicians but today this is not the best that we can offer our students. We want to learn how to enable them to also develop their personal entrepreneurial skills and an attentive attitude towards personal and environmental health and safety in order to successfully tackle the labour market challenges.\r\n2. Foreign Language competence is still a strong requirement for both staff and students. The lack of communication skills is the main barrier to information exchange and intercultural comprehension. It also limits the access to the global labour market and studying abroad. We expect our staff will use their improved language skills for their personal and professional growth and stimulate students to engage in language studying, more extensive CLIL use and active presence on eTwinning for events, groups and projects.\r\n3. In the past, we mainly focused on the weakest students to reduce educational failure but maybe we neglected the best ones a bit: we need to integrate our teaching methods with path personalization, taking into account different learning styles and times, to engage all the students in their own education at the best they can.\r\n4. The \u2018Good School\u2019 reform has paved the way to new organisational opportunities that we want to use widely in the spirit of the best European management practices.\r\nWe have chosen to include all the staff professional profiles in LUF, as we strongly believe they all play a significant and irreplaceable role within the school community. We will select 56 staff members (the Headmistress, 40 teachers, 15 ATA staff) who will propel the school forward on the innovation and internationalization process.\r\nLUF includes: 15 days job shadowing + teaching assignment, 15 days of pure job shadowing and a 487 course days. We expect the participants to acquire certified competences and work side by side with foreign colleagues to acquire new knowledge, share their expertise and lay the foundation for future collaboration in eTwinning projects.\r\nSince we want to be absolutely sure all the training activities will be fully consistent with the project targets, we have  arranged a total of 29 mobilities with the three partner schools and with MBA school in Las Palmas. We will choose the remaining courses by turning to course providers with proven professionalism and competences.\r\nA Selection Committee, an Organising Committee, and an Evaluation Committee will support and monitor the project and guarantee its consistency with the school innovation path. Monitoring tools and project benchmarks are clearly outlined. The data acquisition and processing will be supported by \u2018LUF_2018_20\u2019, an upgrade of SEITI_2015_17\u2019 software.\r\nThe preparatory step will include: online and in-presence language activities, cultural and safety information, a workshop and an extensive eTwinning use for task-related training.\r\nThe most significant concrete expected results are: syllabus revision including new teaching methods respectful of personal learning styles and times and aiming at eliciting personal entrepreneurial skill development, further reduction of educational failure and excellence result enhancement, staff\u2019s and students\u2019 certified language improvement, extensive use of eTwinning for professional training, communication and projects.\r\nWe will devote special care to the dissemination step since we strongly believe if something is not visible it has effectively never happened, no matter its quality!

By so doing it will enhance their knowledge and skills for inclusion into their academic studies and enhance their  employability. It is anticipated that these students will work alongside company staff in developing new software and related products to enable greater efficiency in recording and storing data and in developing gaming products for use as employee rewards. It will also ensure that they are able to communicate in another European language, ie. Spanish thus opening up employment opportunities not only in Spain but other global countries. One of the Spanish placements available is working with a South American country developing programmes for use in hospitals and care centres to record all patient information.\r\nThis period of placement for the Level 3 students will be for two weeks and they will be primarily placed  in computing repair centres located in the city. The work that they undertake will correspond to that being done in the UK and relate directly to their Level 3.

Furthermore, this project wants to develop the field of guitar making in a more sustainable direction, creating a European network on non-tropical woods in guitar building as well as  a sustainable supply base of non-tropical woods for lutherie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leonardo Guitar Research Project wants to make the educational curriculum for lutherie students more relevant to the future needs of luthiers/employers by introducing new teaching methods (where luthiers act as mentors for individual students, in combination with individual work placements) and integrating new study material into the curriculum (a handbook on the characteristics of non-tropical woods, a methodology for evaluating acoustic guitars and a teacher guide on sustainable forest management). The project partners want to teach lutherie students to use a wider range of woods in guitar making, specifically non-tropical woods, to improve their skills and knowledge, increasing their chances on the labour market, and to provide them with a better appreciation of the environmental impacts of lutherie and the importance of sustainability in wood use. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a business standpoint, the Leonardo Guitar Research Project wants to provide professional guitar luthiers with the proof that guitars made from non-tropical woods can look and sound as good as those made with tropical woods, give them broader range of woods to choose from for making guitars, a well as a sustainable and cost effective supply base of non-tropical woods and a potential competitive edge and point of difference for European luthiers versus lower cost imported guitars from Asia by market's \r\n\r\nexploitation of \u2018Made with European Sourced Sustainable Woods\u2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Leonardo Guitar Research Project will deliver the following results: \r\n\r\n- an enhanced educational curriculum for the students of the participating lutherie schools, developing and incorporating new study material (on non-tropical woods and sustainable forest management and on methodologies for evaluating acoustic guitars), a new teaching methodology (to have more students working together on the same guitar), the practice of entrepreneurial luthiers mentoring for students who will undergo work placements, and increased opportunities for learning mobilities (introducing transnational workshops)    \r\n\r\n- the determination of the most suitable non-tropical wood types for making high-end acoustic guitars, to become a realistic option for schools/students and entrepreneurs/luthiers\r\n\r\n- the creation of a sustainable supply base of non-tropical woods. \r\n\r\n- the development of a European network for sharing experiences and good practices on guitar making with non-tropical woods  \r\n\r\n - the development of a comprehensive communication plan to ensure broadscale results dissemination, including a roadshow with lectures and demonstrations, the appointment of some famous guitar players acting as ambassadors of our project, taking project guitars on tour, and the organisation of the first Leonardo Guitar Festival. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key impact of this project will be to change the mindsets of students, teachers, musicians, luthiers and their wood suppliers: that non-tropical wood can indeed be a good and viable option to make beautiful and excellent-sounding guitars. Creating a sustainable supply base and providing scientifically based information on the qualities of different kinds of woods will make non-tropical wood a true option for schools and luthiers. They will soon realise that using non-tropical wood is not only a good marketing trick, but it is also more profitable. As the craft is a very traditional one, the mindsets can only be changed by extensively researching the properties of the different woods, by creating a sustainable supply base, by influencing the curricula of the schools \u2013 and finally, by making great guitars and submitting them to comprehensive testing. As a result, non-tropical wood will be used more and more in guitar building. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partnership of the Leonardo Guitar Research Project is involving three renowned guitar lutherie schools (CVO Rivierenland, Belgium; Ikata, Finland; Lincoln College, England), one knowledge centre for lutherie (Cmb, Belgium) and four highly regarded entrepreneurial luthiers (R\u00e9mi Petiteau, France; Chris Larkin, Ireland; Thomas Holt Andreasen, Spain; Lorenzo Frignani, Italy), together representing seven different EU-countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goals and activities of the Leonardo Guitar Research Project are fully consistent with EU2020 policy on education, climate change, innovation and employment.", "http://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-BE02-KA202-000444_1"], ["4PN", "FOOD FOR THOUGHT - DEVELOPING AND SHARING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES", "Lincoln Christ's Hospital School", 103670.0, "Our partnership relies on experience and innovation with three partners who are used to working together and who have proven their ability to successfully carry out efficient and enriching projects together and the arrival of a new French partner willing to open itself to international cooperation  and to widen its students' opportunities by giving them an experience of the wealth and quality of  collaborative work.\r\n'Mens sana in corpora sano' - The objective of this project is to give the students a clear understanding of the issue of health by allowing them both to experience our diversity and to reflect upon our different perspectives.

This leads \u2013 combined with the freedom of settlement guaranteed by the EU \u2013 to lots of well-educated young people searching a job in another country than their home. After some time lots of these young people come back frustrated to their home country because they cannot find a job or they cannot tackle the different cultural attitudes towards work and getting dismissed.Aim of the projectFor a successful job application in a European country the students need to have knowledge about specific differences e.g. in the application process, the documents required (application, CV), the procedures of a job interview or assessment centres or the structure of the respective labour market.If successfully hired, the new employees will experience specifics of working culture of the new working country as well.Every future employee should be aware of having to tackle another language as well as significant differences in the organisation and results of working processes etc., differences which can be intransparent and therefore potentially problematic for the employee.The curriculum of business studies gives the students basic knowledge about topics like the EU countries and globalisation in general. This Erasmus+ project also takes intercultural aspects into view. Intercultural knowledge is a key competence which is neccessary to acknowledge, think, feel and act with other cultures and so come to a basic understanding about \"the others\".The students learn from peers from other European countries about cultural differences in their respective countries.The aim of the project is to raise the competences of the students for the Europe-wide labor market, which includes:\u2022 applying for a job in a foreign country \u2022 being successful in a job interview in a foreign country\u2022 being aware of differences in labor law between the countries\u2022 being able to tackle with different cultural attitudes towards work\u2022 gaining an entrepreneurial view on human ressources management Project structureThe project is planned for two years according to the guidelines of ERASMUS+ KA2.Done on a two year basis the actual project work is done on four campus meetings. In general it would make sense to have the same student group for two campus meetings, so there would be a change after the second meeting. Each participating country sends a group of six students to the campus meetings.As we handle a business topic it is useful to simulate the competition on the market both of the employees and the companies (as simulated for selling-purchasing processes in the previous project Virtual trade, real savings). Each of the participating countries is simulating two virtual companies which want to hire people. Each participating student applies for a job in the companies of the other countries.There will be four campus meetings abroad which include a virtual job fair, presentations about the participating countries, labor law, country specific attitudes towards work, work on applications of the students, job interviews, assessment centres, ect. (Complete plan is in the application field G.1)Project resultsDrafts for the individual application in another language, handbooks for job interviews, presentations and handbooks about the labor law of the different countries, presentations and handbooks about cultural attitudes towards work in the different countries, material for assessment center training.", "http://www.lincolncollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-022852_1"], ["4PN", "Less is More - the Smart City", "Lincoln Christ's Hospital School", 120186.0, "The project partnership links five state secondary schools from Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom with over 6000 pupils between them for three years. The schools have very different characters due to their locations and varied pupil intakes. However, they share common concerns about the future including sustainability, the responsible and irresponsible use of resources and energy, and human interactions where there are conflicting values regarding supply and demand, consumption and fairness. Skidelsky\u2019s question \u201cHow much is enough?\u201d is the central question. Over three years students and teachers will work together on the overall theme Less is More: the Smart City. Their thinking and actions will be channeled through three pairs of sub-topics followed for a year each by different core teams of 6 students per school per annum. The objectives include raising awareness of the practical and moral issues, considering solutions and sharing them with a wider audience across Europe. The \u2018Europe 2020\u201d agenda provides a framework through which skills such as foreign languages and digital competence in the use of modern media will be enriched. Considerable use will be made of apps in the project.Throughout the project, students will work in internationally mixed teams. Before meeting for an annual mid-year plenary conference to be held in Hattingen (2017), Schijndel (2018) and Lincoln (2019), they will have collaborated through email, twitter and eTwinning to develop knowledge and thinking on the three pairs of sub-themes. These are Environment and Mobility, Living and Economy, and Government and People.  After the annual meeting they will be responsible for dissemination through websites, displays and ultimately an online project handbook of good practice. The participants at each mid-year conference will agree on a manifesto relating to their particular area of study, which will be circulated widely. At the final conference, there will also be a summative manifesto on Less is More to be circulated at European level.ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF BENEFICIARIESHeadteachers and school co-ordinators will be the facilitators with student representatives attending the teacher meetings through Skype. There will be annual face-to-face meetings for each group in one of the partner schools, but most contact will be by Skype or email. The long term effect will be the product of sustained teamwork in the form of series of statements about the sort of world the students would like to inhabit, which will be expressed in various digital and creative ways, and then disseminated through the web, eTwinning, school curricula and in live performances and presentations.  This will be disseminated through the ambassadors each year to the anticipated 1500 participants i the multiplier events.There will also be a long-term training commitment through the development of a new KA1 staff mobility opportunity available to all Erasmus+ countries. The longer term impacts will be that the participants will be committed to making a difference to their own lives and those of other Europeans through this exciting collaboration.", "http://www.christs-hospital.lincs.sch.uk", "Lincoln Christ's Hospital School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024551_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1HA", "Collaboration 4 Growth - Central Lincs (C4G)", "Lincoln BIG", "Collaboration 4 Growth (C4G) is a pilot project aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of businesses in Central Lincolnshire.
