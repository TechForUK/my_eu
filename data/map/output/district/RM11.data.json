The long-range forecasts for investments and energy market are determined by highly interconnected environmental, geological and technological research despite scientific differences in modelling the scenarios and interpreting the data. The medium-range forecasts for investments and energy market largely depend on geopolitical considerations and internal pressure by public opinion and stakeholders. States, firms and other actors play their game within the current legal framework at the international, regional and national level. Accordingly, the proper policy design for the sustainable energy needs to be complemented by research on the legal, regulatory and geopolitical side.\nHowever, the characteristics of social sciences which drive their approach to such issues are determined by their fragmentation into sectoral domains and national traditions.

Migration is a challenge that all European countries are facing not only as a result of the war in Syria, but also as a result of the economic crisis and the intraregional migration which is particularly dynamic in Europe. Researchers predict that the numbers of migrants will keep growing, especially because of climate changes. We are faced with a European challenge that needs European cooperation to address the growing needs of migrants. \r\nAccording to the Report \u201cPromoting the health of refugees and migrants\u201d (WHO, 2017) women, children including unaccompanied minors, and people with disabilities \u2013 are particularly vulnerable to health problems. These individuals are at higher risk of developing communicable and noncommunicable diseases, including mental health problems. Migration and displacement can also pose specific health threats, including sexual violence, especially against women and girls. This is particularly significant, since women and girls who are refugees or migrants often face diverse sexual and reproductive health challenges and are most vulnerable to preventable mortality and morbidity arising from lack of sexual and reproductive health services.\r\nIn the Annex of the above mentioned report, among the proposed priorities for the promotion of the health of refugees and migrants is to \u201cProtect and improve the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents living in refugee and migrant settings. Priority should be given to the provision of essential health services such as: a minimum initial service package for reproductive health, sexual and reproductive health information and services; maternal health care including emergency obstetric services, pre- and postnatal care; prevention, treatment, care and support for sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and specialized care for survivors of sexual violence, as well as supporting for child health activities.\u201d \r\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that \u201ceveryone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices\u201d. However, legal status has proved to be one of the main formal barriers to migrants' access to healthcare services, and communication and cultural differences the main informal barriers. \r\nThe project \"Migrant Women as Healthcare Mentors\" will facilitate the access of migrant women and their children to the healthcare services of their host countries by developing innovative language learning tools related to healthcare issues. These tools will be available to adult language educators and to migrants for self-learning purposes. Moreover, a Multimedia Mentoring Guide will be created available to adult educators in order to train migrant women to act as healthcare mentors within their communities, providing useful information to their peers about the healthcare system of their host country, and promote a positive attitude towards preventive practices. \r\nIn addition, healthcare providers will have access to innovative tools for their communication with migrant women that will help them through the examination process (application with medical history questionnaire translated in 15 languages, mobile app with e-vocabulary and useful phrases). It is of most importance to have tools that healthcare providers can easily use in order to communicate with women migrant patients. Such tools can safeguard the confidentiality of information shared between the doctors and the patients as migrants often tend to use other relatives, friends, even their children as interpreters.  \r\nGeneral Objectives\r\nTo support the social inclusion and integration of migrant women\r\nTo raise awareness of the healthcare and educational needs of this disadvantaged group\r\nTo disseminate widely the idea of the project and its results at national and European level \r\nSpecific Objectives\r\nTo supply high quality learning opportunities tailored to the needs of migrant women via OER\r\nTo train migrant women to act as healthcare mentors within their communities\r\nTo facilitate the access of women migrants to the healthcare services of their host countries by providing specific information for the healthcare system in partners\u2019 countries\r\nTo support adult and language educators by extending and developing their competences through the effective use of ICT\r\nTo support healthcare providers in their work with migrant women\r\nTo organise National and European Conferences to spread the project's products and results", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-IS01-KA204-038799_4"], ["2LL", "GREEN WHEELS - Operation, repair and service of hybrid and electric cars", "HAVERING COLLEGE OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION", 1078507.0, "In the project we develop online freely accessible teaching and learning materials focused on operation, repair and service of hybrid and electric vehicles. The learning materials are based on innovative teaching methods to make learning in this area really effective, modern and attractive for students. Modern teaching methods used in this project are Flipped Classroom, Inquire-based Learning, Critical Thinking, Peer Instructions, CLIL etc. We managed to start collaboration with car companies and have invited their experts to share their knowledge with project schools. The Toyota, Porsche and Hyundai experts have been giving hands-on trainings for teachers from our project VET schools.Below the main project outputs are listed. Up to now, we have achieved the following results: Worksheets-All 82 (more than the planned 80) worksheets for practical assignments based on innovative teaching methods are ready in English version and have been translated to CZ, SK and HU versions. We have all 82 worksheets translated to national languages. The worksheets are not only translated, but are also being tested and piloted by consortium schools, sector bodies and national regulatory bodies. Thus the piloting and feedback process is a 3-phase process.Teacher\u2019s Guide- this guide will be a part and parcel of the worksheets that will cover the methodology and the methods used, as well as practical examples of correct answers. So far, we have a methodology sections to each worksheet. Later on, we will take out the methodology sections from each worksheet and will create a separate Teacher\u00b4s Guide out of this material.E-learning activities to go with the worksheets- these online activities are for teachers and students to practise the topics and themes of he worksheets in an interactive way. All the e-learning screens are ready in English and are now being translated to other 3 local language versions.15 Flipped classroom videos- these videos are based on the Flipped Classroom Method and are available in English, the other 3 language versions have been translated and are now piloted by sector skills bodies and regulatory bodies \u2013regarding the correct terminology and the content.20 CLIL Worksheets  with their own methodology- all the 20 worksheets for English in automotive using the CLIL method are available in English version, 10 worksheets have been translated and piloted to CZ, SK and HU, the rest is being translated and piloted.LMS User Manual- this manual of how to use the LMS environment where all the learning material and e-learning activities of the project are placed is now being prepared and will be finalized after the development of the e-learning materials.Online picture and sound based dictionary- this dictionary is being created under guidance of our partner school Holice that has been preparing a list of key words for each worksheet in English together with its translation to the other 3 project languages. As soon as all worksheets and other learning materials have been piloted (expected by December 2018), we will use the template for this interactive dictionary and will work on it. We have had such an online dictionary tool from our previous projects, which means we only need to put the vocabulary there with pictures and have it recorded by native speakers in 4 languages (EN, CZ, SK, HU).Teacher Trainings- not only do we develop innovative learning material, we also focus on teaching the teachers to work with such innovative material to be able to use them in an optimal way. So far we have trained all country mentors, teacher trainers at project schools and we have done several trainings for teachers from non-partner schools. Also, we have prepared some online webinars for any teachers interested- these webinars have not been placed on the project website yet as they need to be technically amended by an expert on video and sound.", null, null, "erasmus_575014-EPP-1-2016-1-CZ-EPPKA2-SSA_13"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM11"}
