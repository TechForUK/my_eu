There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.  These initial programmes to be considered for ENABLE cover a diverse landscape of targets and approaches including natural products, PNA-peptides, synthetic small molecules, and follow ups / improvements to medicines already available.  In addition, soon after initiation, ENABLE will launch an open call for additional efforts to create a sustainable portfolio of antibacterial discovery programmes moving forward. \n\nThe ENABLE consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a productive collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry. We believe these interactions will be synergistic for everyone concerned. Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery. The creation of a cooperative environment in the lifetime of this project and beyond will fulfill the needs of European society in the battle against antibiotic resistance and make a sustainable impact on the future of antibacterial drug discovery.", 34325.0, 73328047.0, "ENABLE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sperotherapeutics.com", null, "fp7_203716_923707430"], ["1LQ", "Data without Boundaries", "Metadata Technology Ltd", "While access to anonymised official microdata for researchers is still uneven both at national and at European level, access to highly detailed and sensitive microdata is now increasingly on the agenda.

Metadata models, standards and schemes were designed.\n\nPilots were developed for European researcher accreditation and for a network of research data centres enabling transnational access to confidential microdata. The team also identified potential improvements in the legal frameworks at national and EU levels in order to facilitate secure access to detailed microdata across borders.\n\nDWB boosted data availability for users by gathering and organising information on current data.

This will be achieved by integrating sophisticated sensors (e.g. micro-chips, electrochemical sensors, spectrometry, and optical sensors) into a solid probe intended to drive down through the soil matrix to perform continuous or semi-continuous measurements.\nThe sensor measurements provide improved and more precise data input through the chemometric analysis as basis for better decision making. Furthermore, the investigation method will be easier and quicker to use, and hence also less costly than current SOA investigation methods. The reason for this is the operation time that will be significantly reduced. In fact the drilling machine will operate at the speed of 0.5m/s and the different sensors will be adapted to offer the required sensitivity and reactivity at such high drilling speed.\nTool wear presented high level of challenge in this area which affects the operation time and the efficiency of the investigation, and failure monitoring has raised quite a lot of interest amongst researchers and has consequently been studied in a number of research projects by research organisations. The reason for this interest is that drilling tool condition monitoring is considered important as it can affect the efficiency of the soil sensing process during drilling.\n\nThe SOIMON project will develop an in-situ soil sensing system that is deployed in a sonic drill machine.

It has revolutionized the US economy by creating 600,000 direct and indirect jobs and contributed $49 billion annually to government revenues. With only a handful of well rigs (72 in Europe compared to over 2000 in the US as of 2012); Europe is 8-10 years behind the USA.\nThe most imminent challenge for oil and gas industry in Europe (and the rest of the world) is therefore being able to demonstrate/guarantee safe exploration and extraction techniques in order to address the associated environmental concerns. The ideal way to do this will be by continuously monitoring environmental conditions and effects (including in the long term) of the underground soil and water in-situ during exploration to be able to effectively mitigate for the soil and aquifer contamination by methane gas and fracking chemicals in the possible event that they occur. With reports in the U.S. of cases where mistakes were made, this is a possibility. This problem has led to a fragmented political landscape regarding shale gas, with Poland being a main backer; the U.K., Lithuania and Romania moving cautiously ahead and others being hesitant. \nCurrently, soil and water inspection is done by testing samples in the lab which is expensive and time consuming. In the FP7 SOIMON project, a soil monitoring system embedded in a sonic drilling pipe has been developed and tested in the field. The system allows soil monitoring while drilling a hole in the soil.
