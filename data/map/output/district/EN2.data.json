However, efforts in this direction are severely hindered by extreme compartmentalization and heterogeneity at all levels and sectors: the global, national, and local organizations active in the field; the different scientific disciplines involved; the methodologies used to acquire, format and present data; the procedures used to analyze the data; and several others. The main goal of the iMarine project is, thus, to launch an initiative aimed at establishing and operating an e-infrastructure supporting the principles of the Ecosystem Approach to fisheries management and conservation of marine living resources. iMarine has three main objectives: (i) the establishment of an iMarine Board, formed by representatives of international organisations involved in this domain, which will define a sustainability-driven data-centric e-infrastructure governance model and organizational and technological policy recommendations; (ii) the management and operation of this e-Infrastructure offering user-level and application-level services that support the recommended policies and provide relevant functionality to the stakeholders; (iii) the extension, adaptation and deployment of a rich set of software components that implement these services. Instrumental in the activities of iMarine will be the establishment of an active set of collaborations with other international initiatives. The aim will be to reuse and render interoperable existing policies, technologies, and e-infrastructures.

Leonard Cheshire Disability has grown to have over 200 services throughout the UK over 65 years. We support over 21,000 disabled people in the UK, providing innovative services that give disabled people the opportunity to live a life without barriers. We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute economically, and to participate fully in society. The needs and aspirations of disabled people are at the heart of what we do. \r\n\r\nThe EVS project will take place in three Leonard Cheshire services, located across the UK: Fethneys, Bradbury House and Arnold House.  The project involve 6 volunteers, 2 volunteers per every service and will last 12 months with starting dates in March and May 2016. The volunteers are aged from 22 to 29 years old and  come from Egypt, Germany, Greece and Spain. \r\n\r\nVolunteers selected for this project have background in social work, psychology, education or engineering and logistics and have previous personal or professional experience supporting people with disabilities. They are great candidates with the right among of experience and interest in disability issues, and they all express their wish to continue working towards bettering the conditions and rights for people with disability and interest in developing their personal competences as well as in the field social care and working with disabled people as well as gaining international experience. \r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the project is goes in line with our organisational goal: to ensure that residents are provided with the opportunity to live their lives the way they choose - with the support to live independently. This is achieved through the following objectives:\r\n1. To introduce new, diversified activities to the activities programme and introduce intercultural perspective\r\n2. To support residents in fulfilling personal long-term goals and with accessing local community services and leisure activities\r\n3. To promote local and international volunteering\r\n4. To raise disability awareness for the volunteers and in the local community\r\n5. To support fundraising efforts to raise funds that will support the above mentioned aim\r\n\r\nOur members of staff provide the necessary care and assistance to enable residents to live as independent and full a life as possible.  However, it is the volunteer who can give extra time and attention to the residents. Our volunteers are actively involved in shaping their EVS experiences by developing the activities plan with residents and staff. Volunteers bring their own ideas, skills and passions to share with residents. As a result, the role is varied depending on their own skills and interests, and the needs of residents and the activities they like to engage in. \r\n\r\nActivities take place either in the home or in the local areas, and the delivery of activities is heavily influenced by the skills and motivation of our volunteers to design a creative and fun activity programme. Activities include but are not limited to: arts and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, movement, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraising, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes.\r\n\r\nDiversity of activities and enhanced individual support will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local community. This will improve residents' confidence which we envisage will lead to long term benefits of getting residents to do things like volunteering, organising events, talking about disability issues in the local community and be more involved in decisions made locally and nationally in regards to the care sector and disability issues.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact of the project for the volunteers is to become ambassadors for disability issues. It is expected that the participants will continue to promote disability rights and work towards a society that values disabled and non-disabled people equally. In addition, participants will improve their life skills and key competences through working and communicating with diverse people and gaining a better understanding and solidarity with people who face barriers to participate in society. The placement will provide the volunteers with the opportunity to gain insight into the social services sector, which may help them decide on a career path.\r\n\r\nThe project will also have a positive impact on our staff, and LCD as a whole.
