The courses, with their opportunities for cultural visits and sessions as well as observations in European schools will provide a real context  for learning, to enhance knowledge and understanding. They offer the potential to develop links for future partnership work and links. Being able to see a European context will also broaden the teachers terms of reference when facilitating learning.\r\nThe chosen school participants have demonstrated they are committed to networking through their involvement with cluster schools and wider in the context of work done with others in our neighbouring county of Bedfordshire. They  have been selected because they are key facilitators of staff development and learning in the school, sharing good practice,working alongside colleagues providing mentoring, support and challenge , whilst at the same time using the experience to reflect and develop teaching and learning in their own classrooms. \r\nThe school recognises that the courses methodology and approach will develop evaluation strategies, give opportunities to observe practice and widen partnership work. Developing knowledge and understanding of European education systems will broaden understanding of practices and policies. \r\nThe courses will provide opportunities to improve  competencies within participants\u2019 own practice, raising questions and thought about curriculum provision within the school. The structure of networking, sharing, joint preparation and presentation will develop communication and improve management skills. \r\nThe participants will benefit from the opportunity to share good practice during the course and to take responsibility for developing their own methodology and teaching approaches, as well as that of others in the school and wider cluster on their return. This provides opportunities and the confidence for taking on the responsibility for leadership in a wider context which is often difficult in a small school.\r\nWe will develop a website using edublogs to provide a platform where other teachers can access our experience and use it to develop their practice further.\r\nThe long term  success of the course will be the constant evaluation and refining of what the school does based on the sharing, observation and interaction with others.", "http://www.whitefriarsinfants.org.uk", "Whitefriars Infant School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002212_coordinator"], ["9HW", "Kompetentniji nastavnici za uspje\u0161nije pou\u010davanje djece s poreme\u0107ajem iz autisti\u010dnog spektra (PAS)Engleski naziv: Increasing Teacher Competences to Make Learning Easier for Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)Akronim: ITC 4 ASD KIDS", "Target Autism Training and Consultancy Ltd", 17092.0, "Project \u02ddIncreasing Teacher Competences to Make Learning Easier for Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (ITC 4 ASD KIDS)\u02dd was initiated by Centre for autism in Zagreb with idea to create opportunities for professional development for our teachers through international cooperation and to put more light on needs of children and adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The vision of our institution is based on encouraging our teachers to engage in lifelong learning and education, so we can strive as an institution to offer our pupils a wider and better educational opportunities. The history of our successful cooperation and coordination with a variety of institutions in Europe indicated the willingness of our employees to properly seize the opportunity for professional advancement within this Erasmus + Call and to develop new international cooperation for the benefit of their future professional development and meeting the needs of our students.The project was planned in cooperation with Target Autism in Northampton, England, organization which provides consulting services, training and support to children and young people with any kind of communication difficulties or autistic spectrum disorders and provides professional support to special education teachers and staff. This organization also has a long and successful cooperation with a number of mainstream and special schools in Northampton that educate students with ASD and other special needs. With help of Target Autism, our Center got in touch with two regular and three special schools in Northampton educating students with different educational needs, from preschool age through early adulthood.

Namely, 12 employees (teachers) spent 10 days participating in mobility at mainstream and specialized schools in Northampton where autistic students are taught. All of our expectations and learning outcomes have been achieved, to the satisfaction of all participants, and thus the CZA. \r\nEducation and training of students with autism is a complex task. Our students differ significantly from most of their peers by the way they learn and communicate, with pronounced social difficulties and often challening behaviors. Given these characteristics, teaching them requires a multidisciplinary approach, knowledge of different methods that have the role of facilitating the learning process and overcoming the obstacles that arise because of their developmental abilities, as well as the ability to evaluate each child effectively and to create an individualized program for students. The Center is composed of professionals from different profiles: special education needs teachers, art teachers, physical education teachers, music teachers,religion teachers, psychologists, social workers, sensory integration therapists, teaching assistants (educators, caregivers and medical staff). Our staff regularly participate in educational workshops and round tables as a lecturer, also as a trainee in order to increase their own competences and expertise.\r\nIn Northampton we had the opportunity to see how important the role of teaching assistants was and how much time they devote to their education. Teaching Assistants make an important part in the process of educational work with ASD students, and the main role of teaching assistants is to help and support ASD students to successfully overcome the educational challenges, together with the teacher, the teaching assistant creates an atmosphere in which children learn and develop to their full potential. The teaching assistants do not have the opportunity to have and an education outside the institution and, together with the teacher, they act as a bridge between the pupils and the curriculum, that is they contribute greatly to the children's learning of the contents provided by the plan and program. We want to provide professional development of employees at all levels to acquire better competences for working with children with ASD by accessing the modern specialized school in England. To make collaboration with schools as successful as possible, we plan to continue to work with Target Autism in England. An organization that provides counseling and education services and support to children and young people with any type of communication difficulties or autistic spectrum disorder and to the expert staff that works with such children on a daily basis.\r\nThe project is designed to include 10 of our staff members (8 teaching assistants and 2 members of the project team - coordinator and another member as a professional escort). The host schools are a specialized Billing Brook School and Greenfields Specialist School for Communication. Mobility will take place over 4 days (two days in each school), where teaching assistants will observe the work of both teaching assistants and teachers. Their progress and learning will be monitored through the day-to-day fulfillment of systematized work diaries and work with the assigned mentor.\r\nThe mobility will take place through three phases:\r\n1. Before mobility \r\n2. During mobility \r\n3. After mobility \r\nWe expect that teaching assistants, who will participate in mobility, will increase job satisfaction and work motivation, improve their competences in applying the methods of which they have previously used and adopt new knowledge on methods they have not known so far in working with ASD students. We also expect assistants to improve their competence in teaching ASD students through the acquisition of new knowledge on the use and adaptation of different methods and techniques like (visual support, step by step and assistive technology as a means of communication) and to adopt new knowledge and skills related to the adaptation of teaching children with ASD with regard to pupils' cultural diversity. We expect this project to lead to better colaboration between teachers and teaching assistants, as new skills and competences will significantly improve the work of students and thus make the learning outcomes themselves bigger and more successful. This will certainly reflect on the daily success of our students, to the satisfaction of teachers, teaching assistants and of course our partners , the parents.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-HR01-KA101-046940_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN10"}
