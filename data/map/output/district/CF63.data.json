Indeed in various elections in member states since 2014 the radical right was able to secure between 10% and 25% of votes.  According to the EU document 'The European Union and the Challenge of Extremism and Populism'  as a result of various European strategies and political 'opportunism' , right-wing politics has 'spread into the public space and pervaded traditionally moderate political discourses in Europe'.  These issues are being discussed in the media, within communities and at home, impacting on the views and opinions of our children.These themes have to be handled carefully and sensitively in our multicultural societies hence why the planning for this project has been extensive and the workplan will be conducted by experts in this field and involves young people, parents and members of the wider community in all regions.  This project cannot be carried out by one country in isolation.  We need a collaborative approach bringing in expertise from across Europe to inform and contribute to this complex issue.  Although we are including partners from only 3 countries they are linking to ELAN the European Local Authority Network established by Cardiff Council in 2015.  Partners from this network will join partners in this project in a series of planned events thus broadening access to wider base of expertise.  The first planned project meeting will coincide with an event in Cardiff aimed at bringing professionals from a extensive number of European countries together to discuss a wide number of essential themes, this being one of them. Our objective is to develop materials for use in primary schools following extensive and detailed teacher training.  We recognise that due to the sensitive nature of this project all participating staff need to be highly trained prior to introducing any of these themes in the classroom.  Once trained these individuals will work with experts to begin designing lesson plans utilising the collaborative and extensive knowledge and experience available in all countries.  All teaching materials will be supported by a series of short films created for and designed by experts, teachers and the wider community.  These films will be used as part of the resources developed during the life of this project.The materials will be thoroughly piloted in participating schools before publication and extensive teacher training opportunities for other professionals not involved in this project will be available throughout to widen participation in all regions.  Cardiff Council has invited The European Local Authority Network (ELAN) partners from across Europe to the first multiplier event highlighted in this application.  This network was established by Cardiff Council in 2015 to bring local authorities together in partnership and collaboration.", "http://www.got.uk.net", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024288_10"], ["2JS", "Raising Achievement Together - a vision for European schools", "Cadoxton Primary", 199787.0, "Through this project we aim to discover why STEM subjects are so unattractive to young learners in schools and beyond, particularly amongst girls.  We want to investigate primary and secondary practices with a view to radically changing practices in all regions.  To achieve this we have set the following objectives:-Design and develop STEM activities that are both innovative and motivational-Utilise the knowledge and experiences of our young learners to identify areas for development and improvement-Involve young learners in the review of teaching practices and development of STEM activities-Promote engagement in STEM activities with families and the wider community-Encourage teamwork and collaboration as one of the basic pillars in the STEM environment-Widen participation in these project activities locally, nationally and internationallyI order to meet these objectives we will participate in a blended mix of activities to include:-transnational project management meetings-the development of baseline assessments and impact review-teacher training-preparation of classroom materials-developing pupil voice-pupil exchange-multiplier events-encouraging family engagement-local teacher training activities-ETwinning-development of Good Practice GuidelinesThroughout the project we will closely evaluate and monitor all activities. We develop internal evaluation instruments to measure the impact of STEM in different countries on teacher performance and student outcomes. We will conduct a thorough baseline assessment at the start of the project and a detailed impact review at the close.  We will evaluate both hard data and attitudes to STEM subjects using this information to inform progress throughout.  The baseline assessment will look at hard data such as standards in STEM subjects, the choices made by young learners post-school study in digital and other STEM subject areas, engagement in STEM activities at primary level, parental engagement in STEM school based activities etc. and importantly engagement by students with fewer opportunities.  This will be coupled with a study of attitudes linked to gender balance, motivation and identifying role models.  In addition all activities will be evaluated and the results will inform next steps.The impact review will revisit the same content as the baseline the results from which will measure impact overall and provide essential information needed to evaluate the success of the project.  We will be able to show, through standardized testing scores, conclusive and quantitative evidence derived if proposed by this project has a positive impact on student outcomes.  Thus evidencing an increase in standards in all STEM subjects and improved motivation throughout.  The number of teachers engaged in this and similar projects following the multiplier  events will indicate the success of our dissemination plan as will the number of teachers applying for KA1 funding to take part in the training programmes planned in year 2 and 3.The number of parents and the wider community engaged in school activities will also be an indicator of the success of this project.  We anticipate that pupils and students will be better supported at home by involving the parents and families in STEM activities.", "http://www.cadoxtonprimary.com", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024292_13"], ["2JS", "Teaching Digital, Literacy and Multi-Lingual Skills Through Fun Activities.", "Cadoxton Primary", 69165.0, "Three schools in Wales, Spain and Italy identified a need in their pupils to develop literacy skills,  digital competence and improve their knowledge of speaking a foreign language. This was reinforced by research and reports from the European Commission and national governments. The objectives of the project are to improve Literacy, Digital and Multi-lingual skills through the teaching and learning of traditional stories, songs and games from each country. The project activities are designed to be fun, practical and relevant to the pupils. They will combine developing two or even all three skills for each activity. Between the three schools involved in the project there is considerable proven expertise in the areas of literacy, using IT,  and teaching a foreign language. The project will run for three years. Each year, two classes of pupils from each school (approximately 150 children) will work on a common programme of activities in their own school. The activities will develop children's literacy and digital skills by challenging them to share stories, songs and games from their country with children from the other two countries. They will teach the children from the other countries stories from their culture and how to play 'their' games through various activities such as creating digital books, writing instructions, creating instructional videos, etc. These activities will also be used to develop children's multilingual skills and provide opportunities to communicate in a foreign language. Pupils will be encouraged to use all three skills in the same activity.From each school, ten pupils will visit the other schools to form a class of 30 pupils. They will work in mixed nationality groups and take part in activities taught by teachers from all three schools. These activities will continue to build on the skills the pupils have already learnt, using digital technology, sharing and teaching stories, songs and games while communicating in another language. The applications they will use include Book Creator, Puppet Pals, Poplet, Pic Collage, Aurasma and Comic Creator.  The results and impact envisaged are that the pupils will improve their literacy, digital and multi-lingual skills. Pupils will also increase their confidence at taking part in an unfamiliar situation. They will develop an understanding of other countries and be more open to accepting a challenge. The impact on the three schools, will be that teachers improve their assessment and teaching of Literacy, Digital and Multi-lingual skills through sharing their expertise and experience. They will also develop other skills from their role(s) participating in a major project. The schools will develop their expertise in assessment, teaching and learning of literacy, digital and multi-lingual skills. They will also have acquired new skills that come from the administration of a European  project and will have developed good relationships with schools in two other countries paving the way for future projects and partnerships.", "http://www.cadoxtonprimary.com", "Cadoxton Primary", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024556_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF63"}
