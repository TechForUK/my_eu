This will be possible by visiting companies and by company supported teaching (alternative traineeship). Furthermore, the students will be taught other subjects aiming at improving their language and cultural skills.\r\nThe reason for this period of study is that we know from experience that Danish business school students seldom apply for international jobs as they lack international skills. The lack of such skills makes it hard for them to find future jobs, and these are skills that the Ministry of Education has pointed out as being of great importance. Internationalization is part of the competence goals by which the students are assessed. This is therefore an approved part of the Danish education and does not prolong the students\u2019 education. Furthermore, it is important that internationalization is emphasized so that the students will be able to cope with international study environments.\r\nIn the course the students will receive an understanding of what it takes to live in another culture, furthermore they will get a good grasp of the Scottish business sector and the Scottish educational system through the subjects they are taught, company visits and the company supported teaching. This course is targeted at the HGS students. Thus the students must have a minimum age of 18 years, and they will be expected to be independent. The importance of making the students feel comfortable will not be neglected, but the main focus will be on vocational training so that their international skills will be strengthened. \r\nFurthermore, the students must start writing a report which must be completed upon arrival home. This report will document their knowledge and skills acquired during the period of study.\r\nApart from further strengthening the students\u2019 commercial skills, the purpose this periode of study is:\r\no To increase the awareness of the students\u2019 own language and culture, and by working with other national cultures the students will acquire an increased understanding of these being very different from their own although they are geographically rather close to Denmark.\r\no To increase an awareness of what other cultures have to offer us\r\no To increase an awareness of equality across national borders\r\no To further strengthen the students\u2019 international and intercultural skills\r\no To increase the students\u2019 mobility\r\nAs we have implemented ECVET, the students will receive a learning agreement prior to the period of study with detailed information on which competence goals they will be expected to acquire during the period of study.\r\nUsing Memorandum of Understanding and Learning Agreement the schools make sure, that the responsibility for the various parts the project before, during and after regarding everything from among others information and selection, travel and accommodation, assessment and documentation to validation and recognition is placed.\r\nThis project is an important part of marketing for the three Danish schools in order to attract more and better students.\r\nThrough previous projects we have documented that our students are very interested in participating in periods of study abroad, and therefore we know that the number of students mentioned in this application is realistic.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA102-004135_1"], ["0RF", "Continuing Internationalization at Tradium - part IV", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", 216829.0, "Tradium hereby apply for 280 mobilities for students, 19 accompanying persons and 35 mobilities for employees. We are aware that this is a very large application, but at the same time, we believe that the application is extremely realistic. Tradium is one of the largest combination schools, and internationalization is very integrated into our organization. This was also the reason why, Tradium got the Danish award as being the International School of the year 2012.\r\n\r\nSince 2012, we enhanced the international work by sending out even more students and employees, while we have participated in several international projects. In previous mobility projects we have send out whole classes with approximately half grants, so everybody had the opportunity to receive a grant. In the 2014-project  we have given a full grant for all participants, with the result that we don't have more than 26 student mobilities left.\r\n\r\nWith this project we apply primarily for grants for mobility in the year 2015/2016, but we have also added some elected classes for 2016/2017. This application is the result of an internal application process, where the departments of Tradium have fulfilled an internal application based on their needs for future mobilities in their department.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities for the year 2016/2017 are for the classes that have integrated the mobilities as a mandatory part of their training and the mobility project to Glasgow (which has been completed the last many years). This type of mobilities we are 100% certain will be realized, and that is why it would be right to inform all the relevant stakeholders about the economic conditions earlier on. For this reason we have applyed for 2016/2017 mobilities for these special classes as well, a total of 101 mobility grants for students + 3 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe project is implemented in continuation of Tradiums strategy of having a global vision, and thus to the desire to integrate internationalization into all of the programs offered by Tradium. The Mobility project is a very important element in this strategy.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we wish to send out 188 VET students, 92 HHX students and 35 employees. VET students are primarily basic course students at either GF1 or GF2, but there are also individual students from the main program (school training students). We are applying for grants to accompanying persons to our basic course students, as these students are relatively young (some are under 18), and many times they are not strong linguistically / culturally. HHX students are all first-year students from the school's two international study programs. Staff members come from all parts of the school: Managers, teachers and administrative staff.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the mobility project will be in extension of the enclosed MoU / LOI. There will be an increased focus on getting participants' learning outcomes described in a better way (ECVET), partly by using Learning Agreements for the description of the individual's learning outcomes, and assessed by the host partner. At the same time we will maintain the Europass Mobility as a recognition of the skills that the participant has achieved during the mobility.\r\n\r\nExpected effect for students:\r\nThe project will help to increase students' linguistic, international and intercultural competencies. Particularly VET students often have a limited global vision, which makes it difficult for them to operate in an international environment. With this project, they will be better to compete with other groups of students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX / HTX participants, they also need a practical approach to their theoretical education. The work placements for these students will add this dimension.

Agencies have years of experiences with the organization of mobility and network businesses, where students will be on the job learning placement. \r\nIn the second part of the activity (A2) we have 5 different streams of staff mobility who will go abroad for job shadowing. Three mobility will be carried out by individuals, one mobility will be attended by two teachers and one last counts seven teachers, who are experts in health care.

The first week of each group will be accompanied by a teacher, except with health and care will be two teachers. For activities A1 we want students enable on-the-job learning placement fields of secondary vocational and technical programs, such as computer science, electrical engineering, woodworking, car mechatronics, mechanical engineering, mechatronics, logistics, health care, gastronomy, agriculture, nature protection, trade and economy, and their mobility recognized as part of the learning process.\r\nIn the part A3 we will organize 9 mobilities for acoompanying persons who will join to 8 groups of students mobility going on-the job learning. They will spend only first week abroad, so we have separately marked activity A3 for teachers as acoompanying person, anyway it will be organized together with activity A1. \r\nAdditional project objectives for students are: to come familiar with education system of host country, to upgrade theoretical knowledge, to know better the procedure of  work and changes set by the foreign labor market, develop language (communication) and intercultural competences (knowing customs and traditions of new countries) and actively spend free time (get to know with culture and history of host country). \r\nWe want to speed the cooperation between VET institutions in Slovenia and other countries.

Every BKCR student should be enabled to actively take part in their educational processes, i.e. teachers and students together determine the content and design of their learning processes.In 2015, the BKCR was awarded the title \u201eEuropaschule\u201c by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, acknowledging our various international endeavours over the past decades. We believe that the main objective of our school \u2013 enabling personal and professional self-sufficiency intertwined with ethical responsibility \u2013 can only be achieved with an international perspective. For the first time, this mobility project would give students from all three of our departments the opportunity to do an internship abroad. This time abroad would enable us to prepare our students even better for their professional lives. The internships for the remedial/therapeutic educators in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, would provide a hands-on comparison of the basic principles of remedial/therapeutic work in Sweden and Germany. This would enable our students to have a significantly broader perspective on the German system of inclusion. The elementary principles of facilitating education in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) are \u2013 together with curricula and regulations \u2013 the central point of reference for educators and child carers in training. The concept of early childhood education has the goal of \"taking part in society\" (participation). The state of NRW recognizes that the foundations for societal participation are laid in the area of elementary and primary education. Other EU countries pursue this goal using different approaches.The above-mentioned fundamentals are valid for the field of business/administration as well. In the competence-oriented guidelines for the subject \"business administration\", for example, this is put into action through the topic \"human resources.\" In this project, office management students research possibilities for participation within a company. While in Glasgow, the students would analyze how the different national regulations they researched in class are put into practice. We expect the students in this project to significantly expand their competences regarding their discernment of job migration options and their ability to deal with diversity in the workplace.  The number of students taking part in this project would be 34. They are studying to be state-certified child carers/educators (including A levels), remedial/therapeutic educators, or office management clerks. All of these students will do the internships in their last year of training. The project topic, participation and inclusion for people with and without special needs (both in and outside of professional life), is an element within the main subjects in all three courses. Going abroad is prepared in class and also through numerous other activities. A Swedish language class is obligatory for all students doing their internships in Sweden, regardless of their course. This provides an interdisciplinary platform for this European project. Other examples are intercultural activities students prepare for other students at the \u201eEurope day\u201c celebrated at our school.Our co-operation agreements with Borl\u00e4nge and Glasgow are bi-directional. Additionally, the BKCR has established 3 classes for refugees. This and the Erasmus+ project will expand the intercultural competence of students and teachers at the BKCR.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003023_5"], ["0RF", "Continuing Internationalization at Tradium - part V", "CITY OF GLASGOW COLLEGE", 208120.0, "Implementation of this project is an extension of Tradiums strategy to have global outlook, and include internationalization in all of Tradiums educations. Internationalization is a beacon for Tradium, and it is included in the strategic, tactical and operational levels. In 2012, Tradium was recognized with the international prize for our international engagement.  After the changes following OK13 and EUD reform in 2015, we have been concerned about the development within international activities, for example, mobility projects (timewise, resources as well as structural). Luckily, our experience is that many of our departments have made a priority to implement mobility projects. Within our vocational education, it is now typical that our EUX students in the beginning of their education and training, as well as our school internship students have had the opportunity to use the mobility grants to travel to one of our partner schools. After the restructuring of the vocational educations, it has been assessed that the options of mobility projects has been more constricted. With the agreement of OK13 the costs have been more considerably higher than before. Our upper secondary education continues to make mobility grants a priority.  We are applying for mobility grants altogether for 132 students, 22 accompaying persons and 19 staff. Our total mobility activity will continue to be high, albeit at a lower level than before. A large majority of our mobility\u2019s are planned for implementation for the school year 2016/2017. The mobility grants we are applying for regarding school year 2017/2018 are for the educations that thru the years have completed mobility exchanges and/or where we have a partnership with another school (MoU).Our mobility grants from 2014 are at the moment nearly used up (1 student grant left, and 2 grants for staff) These 3 mobility grants are expected to be completed in spring 2016.From mobility project 2015 at the moment there are 75 mobility grants planned (out of 164), and 9 (out of 26) mobility grants for staff are under planning.All previous mobility grants have been used up 100% except for one project from 2013, where we with a mistake hadn\u2019t requested the transfer of mobility grants from accompanying person to mobility of students (but just did it in reality) this resulted in a non-approval of that part of our mobility project.  We are applying for accompanying persons because a great part of our students are relatively young (under 18 yrs. old), and for many of these students this is the first time meeting professionals from the business community. The staff comes from all parts of the school, and the people in charge of education in the businesses. Implementation of mobility grants will happen in connection with the attached MoU/LoI. There will be greater focus on learning outcomes of our students, for example by incorporating Learning Agreements describing a specific students learning outcomes assessed by the partner school. We will continue to use Europass Mobility documents to recognize the competences the participants have gained on the mobility.  Affects for students:This project will help increase the student\u2019s language, international and intercultural competences. Especially vocational educational students have had a limited global outlook, which has made it hard for them to interact in an international environment. With this project, it will make it easier to compete with other students on internships and jobs. Regarding HHX participants, there is the need for a practical approach to the otherwise theoretical education. The internship part of their mobility adds this dimension. Afterwards it is expected that most of these students will have a better chance for employment in a globalized work place. These students can also be a model for other students and inspire them to participate in a mobility project in another country. Expected effect on staff/institution:\u2022 Staff/leaders gain language, international and intellectual competences so that our institution can give our students better support in regards to their own mobility. \u2022 Our staff will receive a specific pedagogical and/or skills advancement in their field. \u2022 Teachers will gain new inspiration for their teaching methods and pedagogical methods and tools. \u2022 Leaders/executives will gain new competences around the building up of education systems and inspiration on how to tackle future challenges (EUDs attractiveness, counseling, absence, working together with the labour market, rationalization, digitalization and more).The results of these mobility projects at a minimum will be evaluated and discussed in their respective departments, for example in relation to teacher meetings. The results will be discussed in other areas outside of the respective departments for example in relation to experience group meetings, together with other schools, press activity, Facebook, and/or blogs.", "http://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA102-022089_2"], ["0RF", "Onderwijsgroep Tilburg mobiliteit voor studenten en medewerkers 2016", "WEST OF SCOTLAND COLLEGES PARTNERSHIP", 47129.0, "In this Erasmus+ KA1 project, Onderwijsgroep Tilburg will send 24 professionals abroad to learn about specific innovations in Vocational Education and Training in other countries or about remarkable activities and circumstances in the working field.

They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her.

MUrCS will integrate three subject-specific streams (Planning, Management and Science \u2013 both adaptation and mitigation) in a problem-oriented environment. Students will choose one of these thematic areas as their main and another as their secondary specialism. MUrCS will offer a two-year, 120 ECTS Master degree on the basis of a jointly developed curriculum by the Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU), UK, Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK), Finland and University of Huelva (UHU), Spain. It will lead to triple degrees \u2013 MSc in Sustainable Urban Environment (GCU, fully accredited in the UK), MEng Environmental Technology (LAMK, fully accredited in Finland) and MSc Environmental Technology (UHU, fully accredited in Spain). The consortium includes University of Bologna, Italy, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel and North-West University, South Africa, UNIA, Spain and 7 industry/public body Associate Partners. MUrCS is aimed at both existing urban professionals as well as those with multidisciplinary environmental backgrounds and will create professional pathways in leading sustainable urban climate change. Graduates will gain critical understanding of the complexity of urban sustainability and the need for local action to combat climate change. They will develop intellectual and practical skills as well as the ability to use tools for the collection, analysis and interpretation of data related to urban climate change and sustainability. These and the transferable skills gained during the programme will enable graduates to operate in senior positions in both the public and the private sectors to lead sustainable and climate sensitive urban change. All students will begin their education in Glasgow (GCU) in Semester 1 to undertake core modules together with developing transverse skills (inter-cultural awareness, foreign language competencies, research methods and communication and employability skills). In order to maintain the inter-disciplinary approach, all students will then move to Lahti, Finland (LAMK) in Semester 2 to undertake further core modules and electives relevant to their main specialism. This innovative approach will also ensure staff and student mobility.

The BKCR is an upper secondary school with courses leading up to the university entrance qualification (\u201eAbitur\u201c) with a vocational focus.\r\nThe European project the BKCR is applying for is the continuation of its institutionalized Europe activities that has spawned several previous Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ projects. Every two years since 2007, our school has successfully applied for this kind of projects. In 2016, we made the work placements abroad available to three main departments of the BKCR instead of two (i.e. education/social pedagogy, business/administration, and now also health/remedial education).\r\nFor the new project, we chose the topic \"health\". Our prospective nursery nurses, teachers and educators would have the opportunity to experience and analyse approaches to holistic health promotion at our partner institutions. \r\nOur students of remedial education would focus mainly on mental health. For many people with multiple disabilities, communicating their wishes and needs is highly challenging. Our project participants going to Sweden would get to know their approaches to this problem and, subsequently, compare them to German approaches. \r\nThe office management students would focus on the curriculum-relevant topic \"healthy workplace\", comprised of the aspects \"ergonomy\", \"adhering to the workplace ordinance\" and \"tax-exempt health promotion in the workplace\". The goal here is that our students can learn about the relevant regulations and practices in Scotland and compare them to the ones they know in Germany. \r\nThe number of students taking part in this project would be 34. They are studying to be state-certified child carers/educators (including A levels), remedial/therapeutic educators, or office management clerks, respectively. All of these students will do the work placements in their last year of training. The child education department would send eight students each year (within the framework of their obligatory three-week work placement focusing on \"conceptual and institutional approaches to pedagogical work in Germany, Sweden, Poland and England\"), the remedial education department four. The five students of office management would do two-week work placements. \r\nThe project topic includes both health promotion at the workplace regarding the project participants, and health promotion regarding their clientele (e.g. children, people with the need of specialized care). Health promotion is integral part of main subjects in each of these courses\u2018 curricula. The stays abroad will be prepared and reflected upon in several learning arrangements and/or educational science classes. Furthermore, our co-operations with Vuxenutbildning in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, and City of Glasgow College, Scotland, are bi-directional. In September 2018 and 2019, we expect three Swedish students at our school, doing a three-week work placement at a local hospital. This type of peer-to-peer support is also to be installed with the office management clerk students this time. \r\nWe expect that the work placements abroad prepare our students better for their professional future, e.g. by providing a broader perspective on relevance and possibilities of mental health promotion for young children and people with special needs. Furthermore, we hope for impulses on the level of our own school development. Our school\u2019s work groups for health and Europe have already composed an action plan for health promotion among students. One of the expected results is that project participants get to know communication structures and methods that may be useful for improving student feedback at our school. \r\nWe hope that connecting these two aspects of our school\u2019s program, namely health and Europe, through this Erasmus+ project will prove to create more positive effects. In the long run, we aim to have as many main points of our school\u2019s program as possible to mutually support each other.

However, in spite of a clear case for framing OER as a contributor to innovation in education, the picture that emerges from recent research reveals several obstacles that need to be overcome for OER to have a substantial impact on education and society. Limited reuse and repurposing of OER by educators, manifested by a tendency to use OER as supplementary rather than primary material, have been attributed to several factors: uneven supply, lack of official policies or incentives for reuse, limited proof of effectiveness and lack of digital and pedagogical skills on the part of educators. The substantial political and philanthropic investment in OER has so far mostly focused on the supply side, but there is now a growing need to increase the uptake of OER by educational practitioners and learners. Fostering reuse of OER and engagement in Open Educational Practice (OEP) is essential if education is to move from the current, static OER landscape to one in which OER and OEP play a major role in a vibrant and sustainable learning ecosystem. \r\n\r\nThe ExplOERer project (pronounced \u2018explorer\u2019) promotes OER sustainability through OER adoption and embeddedness in professional practice.

Learners are getting more and more used to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. They play on these devices and the number of apps concerning education is increasing. In learning theory the field of game-based learning is becoming more and more important. Little games have always been used in schools to foster motivation of the students, but improvements in technology have lead us to new experiences and new potentials. IT-supported educational games offer both learning and a focus on the vibrant and dynamic world.Using games in education can be done with more or less media and IT support. In games for educational purposes the learning processes are supported concerning several aspects. For example, leaners are forced to focus on solutions for problems and critical thinking or they are encouraged to combine competencies from different topics and areas. Moreover, they are often also encouraged to work in a team or to get in contact with other team members and improve their social skills.Therefore schools and teachers nowadays can't ignore these new approaches. But the problem is that they have to know how to integrate modern game-based learning approaches in their teaching. Most teachers are not really skilled in this field.This is where the ERASMUS+ partnership project GameON intends to make a difference. The aim of GameON is to get an overview on game-based learning in schools and the needs of teachers in this field. The consortium will create a book that introduces teachers to the concept of game-based learning and gives them an overview. In addition it will take them through several useful serious games in a hands-on approach that helps them understand how the game can be integrated into their classes. The book will also contain a section on future development of game-based learning, providing a detailed overview of which opportunities technology will provide in the coming years (for instance, individualized learning through learning analytics), and what should be developed in the field of game-based learning in order to take advantage of these opportunities.The book will be available in several languages, and it will be widely shared with teachers all over Europe.

The consortium will develop the game for mobile devices and make it available for free so that thousands of learners can benefit from it. It will also study the quality of learning achieved through the game, thus contributing to the further development and advancement of mobile learning and game-based learning.Young generations grow up in a world which is vastly different from the world that existed just a few decades ago. However, educational methods are very slow to change and don\u2019t appropriately reflect the way that young people prefer to learn. For instance, many young people don\u2019t read books for entertainment any more, so learning from a book feels \u201cunnatural\u201d for them. In order to offer great chances of learning that resonate with its target groups the world of education should further explore new approaches and methods of integrating them into school. In recent years serious games have shown an interesting potential to motivate young learners. However, so far very few well-working examples exist that successfully combine high motivation and fun with a solid learning experience. For this reason it is necessary to continue the study of new game approaches that integrate learning content seamlessly into the gameplay.In the project LEVEL the consortium intends to develop a serious game that can be played on mobile devices and meets the challenge of helping the player acquire knowledge while at the same time being fun to play.The idea is to create a jump and run game which lets the players control the game character by learning. This is accomplished by a system which replaces the usual controls with player knowledge input that is directly connected with different actions the character performs. This method and the fact that the game will run at a high pace (the character will continue to run ahead) forces the player to find the correct input as fast as possible. The game has the potential to progress from simple actions at the start that the character is able to perform to a large variety of controls and obstacles in the game. In this way enhanced knowledge will reward the players with better actions and more options which serves as motivation to learn more in order to enhance their skills.In the project the game will be linked to the school subject mathematics and the consortium will study the effects the game has on the learning process.

Although Europe leads the world in recycling, from 2.6 billion tonnes of end-of-life waste, only 40% is  recycled, composted or reused.  This can be improved through a 'Circular Economy (CE)' approach that is based on a vision of nil waste.  The EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy, \u2018Closing the Loop\u2019, provides a critical step forward towards a sustainable, low carbon, resource efficient, and yet competitive EU economy.  For this paradigm shift to be achieved, there is a need that  CE's principles and benefits be disseminated as widely as possible. There is thus an urgent need that education stakeholders at different levels including VET be equipped with the right knowledge about a CE approach, its principles, its benefits to both society and industry as well as the concept that a CE approach can foster a novel breed of 'Green Entrepreneurs' Objectives of the project:The aim of the  Eng@ge  partnership is to thus improve the level of Green Entrepreneurial culture in Europe by providing knowledge about the CE concept to VET stakeholders through an innovative and open digital training toolbox.   To achieve this overall aim the project will have these objectives:O1: To understand the training needs of VET stakeholder with respect to the CE and its benefits to society and business;O2: To develop a framework/curriculum that can address the needs identified in O1;O3: To develop an open and innovative digital training toolbox supporting the training framework/curriculum established in O2, consisting of a set of digital training tools/methods and  six relevant case-studies  providing trainers with the means to adopt their training approach to the needs of different learners;O4: To carry out 1 pilot test to hep improve the digital training toolbox developed in O3,O5: To disseminate and exploit the results of the project in particular the digital training toolbox, to make it available to at least 10,000 people.Number and profile of participants:The project brings together seven partners from six EU Member States with diverse interest and backgrounds, each having a clearly defined role to contribute to the Eng@ge project.  These consist of one Chamber of Commerce, two VET centres, two Higher Education Institutes, one technical consultancy entity with expertise on eco-design and one social enterprise.  Collectively, the partners have the expertise to design, implement and test  a modular digital training toolbox complete with augmented reality based e-learning content.  Main of activities:The seven partners will exploit their significant expertise in the development and use of multi-media resources, e-learning and the use of  virtual and augmented reality for training purposes to design and develop the Eng@ge ditital training toolbox and other project outputs.  Through a number of activities, the partners\u2019 pool of expertise will be used to develop an interactive and immersive learning experience based on digital technologies which challenge conventional linear economy thinking and promote a  green entrepreneurial approach. Methodology:The methodology to be applied in Eng@ge project is based on \u2018\u2019Project cycle Management (PM)\u201d approach, which includes planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the project efficiently throughout its phases, to produce the right Intellectual Output  at the right time, cost and quality.

Increasing employment among young people is an important priority.\r\nDue to this fact, as well as because of serious economic crisis in  Europe, entrepreneurial spirit and business awareness have become even more important among students.  We have found that students in secondary vocational education (and others as well) need to increase their entrepreneurial skills  to be able to think obout working in their own busineses. On the other hand \u2013 to establish a successful company it is necessary to integrate knowledge from different fields in order to achieve the common goal. These are business and marketing skills, industrial and graphic design and  manufacture of the product \u2013 production. These three fields have to work hand in hand. The reality in partners' school systems is that we have skilled experts in each area \u2013 educated in different programs \u2013 with no or very random contacts with each other and lack of global knowledge of how to start their own business. In this project we will combine three different fields of school education working together (production, marketing, design) to achieve the common goal of commercial success. The goal is to create high-quality and useful products which are commercially interesting, beautifully designed and have a potential on the market.\r\nOf great importance is also the fact that students need current practical knowledge that can be obtained only by experts  working in companies. We will develop and upgrade curriculum also by integrating learning from experts working in the business on different areas. We want to include in school education cooperation and integration of different disciplines/programs and inclusion of case study learning from experts on the market with a  common goal -  to create commercially interesting products. We want this to be included systematically, not just random. That\u00b4s why we will develop new/upgraded curiculum \u2013 NET \u2013 ENT (Networking for Entrepreneurship). \r\nBy Networking we mean:\r\n- interaction between the different schools, school programs\r\n- linking education with the labor market\r\n- networking and exchange of experiences from different EU countries (NET \u2013 ENT INTERNATIONAL)\r\n- establishing networks between students of different programs, which can lead to successful entrepreneurial ideas, at the time of schooling and latter on\r\nThe future is in teamwork \u2013 together everyone achieves more. \r\nIn order to do this innovative methods in education are needed - new approaches to teaching and learning. Teachers are the ones  who can stimulate and encourage students.  Therefore we will educate teachers/trainers and experts as well.  Teachers will be  trained to change their teaching methods and meet with different challenges. They should establish supportive relationship, be professional, inspiring  and support  students throughout the project from the early steps (identifying problems or customers' needs - idea - problem solving) through progress monitoring until the  goal is reached.  Teachers will no longer appear only in their traditional role but will become  mentors/coaches/trainers using innovative methods in the class and including mentors from companies where necessary as well as teachers from other schools/programs.\r\nStudents  will benefit from entrepreneurial learning by developing collaborative planning, by understanding essential integration between different areas/programs to create commercially interesting products and start successful business,  as well as essential skills and attitudes such as creativity, initiative, tenacity, teamwork, resilience, understanding of risk and a sense of responsibility (transversal key competences). This  entrepreneurial mind-set will help students to  put ideas into action and become self-confident  in order to meet needs of the real market. It will help them to be more enterprising, competitive and innovative, thus becoming more employable which  is crucial in achieving the objectives. Another benefit of participating in this project  is to recognize the importance of cooperation between different areas to produce a successful product. Also at the time of schooling they will gain the necessary connections enabling them to open their own micro or small companies easier (early networking).\r\nIn order to do this we have chosen reliable  partners we know very well. Our goal in future is also to create long term partnerships and establish international module which can be used in future also for certified  mobilities of students and teachers (NET- ENT INTERNATIONAL).

This changing environment and context places new demands in terms of education and sets new requirements for university graduates. They need to be able to understand \u201cthe nature, scope and consequences of global transformations\u201d (Rivzi 2009: 263) and how to relate to these in geographically, economically, politically and culturally diverse contexts. They also need to be able to conceptualize and behave inside and outside of a local context in culturally sensitive collaboration with the local environment while being mindful of the wider regional or global implications (Gregersen-Hermans, 2016). Because of globalization, internationalization of the curriculum (Leask 2015) has become a necessity for all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), with the result that HEIs are experiencing an increasing diversity of learners. These trends are facilitated in Europe by an increasing use of English Medium Instruction (EMI) in Higher Education (HE) for bachelor's, master\u2019s and PhD programmes. The present project - Educational Quality at Universities for Inclusive International Programmes (EQUiiP) - will directly address quality issues related to these developments, using frameworks, standards and tools which are theory based, and building on current research into Internationalization of the Curriculum (IoC), EMI, Internationalization at Home (IaH), and Intercultural and Global Competence Development (ICGC). The expertise and experience of the partners will enable the project to support HEIs in building an integrated and evidence-based internationalization strategy.  EQUiiP's main objective is to develop a modular set of methods and materials for the use of educational developers (EDs) working in the internationalized curricula of HEIs. EDs are key university staff members who support university teaching staff in the effective delivery of these internationalized curricula in HEIs across Europe. The project will develop five modules for Continuing Professional Development (CPD), which will be related to an internationalized competence profile for EDs working in internationalized curricula. EDs will be able to incorporate this modular CPD programme into their support of university teaching staff. EQUiiP is a partnership of seven European universities that already have proven experience in delivering various dimensions of CPD in the context of internationalized curricula and EMI in HE. All participants in the project are front-runners in internationalization of the curriculum in their respective countries. The size of the partnership means that partners will be able to cooperate intensively in building the materials that comprise the CPD modules through a structured exchange of experiences. Each partner institution brings its own cultural specificity and perspective to the consortium, as well as complementary expertise in the following areas:\u2022 Pedagogy and teaching methods with groups of diverse students in the international classroom, facilitating IaH; \u2022 The development and embedding of international and intercultural learning outcomes (IILOs) in the HE curriculum; \u2022 Assessment, feedback and reflection processes for university teaching staff;\u2022 Intercultural and global competence development (IGCD)and facilitation;\u2022 The role of languages in the multilingual and multicultural learning environment.The EQUiiP project is innovative because of the combination of input from the literature, existing experience and expertise of the participating HEIs, as well as the insights gained in the transnational piloting activities, short training sessions and (regional) multiplier events. The methodology of the project ensures a rigorous development of a package of CPD modules which can be used separately or as a residential integrated intensive CPD programme (winter/summer school), and which are in line with the related competence profile for EDs. The project will build on relevant literature and locally valid, contextually related examples, resulting in a comprehensive approach to the CPD of university teaching staff, which is currently lacking in the contexts described above. EQUiiP will conclude with national and international events including a final conference, allowing for dissemination of all outcomes, including policy recommendations and research findings, to a wider audience. All outputs will be made available through a dedicated online platform, EQUiiP.eu.

A wider group of Industrial working partners in the renewables sector will be involved in the employability skills requirements and assessments.ActivitiesThe activities will include stakeholder consultations in 3 countries to clarify the needs of the renewables industry. This will help inform the development of the International Competencies assessment methodology and a range of learning activities. Most of the learning activities will be undertaken during a 10 day Intensive Study Programme in Scotland in May 2017 (Finland in 2018 and Netherlands in 2019). This includes site visits, industry lectures, role play, group work and cultural activities.

The project has therefore been planned in accordance with the Plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycle thus ensuring continuous improvement throughout the project lifespan.Results and ImpactThe project's results are diverse. There will be a needs assessment of the Renewable Energy Sector; the development of an International Competency App (a methodology to assess potential employability); reports on the students' Competencies before, during and after the learning activities; the development of a 5 ECTS credit module; journal articles, website, videos, training materials.  Local impacts will include Students being better prepared for working life; HE staff being closer to industry and having an improved understanding of key employability skills sought by industry  and industry receiving graduates that are better prepared for employment.  Wider impacts should be realised through the dissemination strategy including stakeholder feedback, seminars, online materials, articles and conference papers. The results will contribute to 3 of the key targets of Europe 2020.Potential long term benefitsThe App will be available for all interested parties and help produce a more reflective approach to the development of employability skills/international competencies.

However, female participation in the labour market is consistently low across the region. In order to develop a skilled STEM workforce to meet industrial demands, it is necessary to increase and engage the female population by overcoming perceived and/or realised barriers to entry.  A key aspect of achieving this involves empowering employers and educators to make positive changes to their workplace environments and practices with a view to creating a more inclusive and attractive sector.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the ENGENDER project is to identify the factors that distinguish between small to medium sized STEM employers that have embraced equality and diversity in the workplace and those who have not. Specifically, the project aims to identify the interventional strategies that have proven to be most effective for improving gender equality in organisations at various stages of engagement. In order to achieve this, we propose the development of a Self-Assessment Toolkit and best practice guides for increasing gender equality engagement that will lead to the development and delivery of a bespoke accredited blended learning training programme.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to positively impact on the flow of female recruits into (and through) the STEM sector pipeline, with a focus on SMEs, and to support unbiased recruitment and retention processes to be mainstreamed into employment and education sectors.  It also seeks to provide educational resources for participants to improve their awareness and understandings of key issues through engagement in relevant, specific accredited programmes with currency within the sector. This approach is proposed in response to an established need for low or no cost flexible educational content.\r\n\r\nIn order to address these key issues the project delivers four key outputs:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Publication of Gender Equality Research and Associated Best Practice Guides\r\n\u2022 Online Self-Assessment Gender Equality Diagnostic Toolkit\r\n\u2022 Blended Learning Training Programme\r\n\u2022 Blended Learning and Dissemination Web Platform\r\n\r\nApplication of these outputs is anticipated to lead to the realisation of the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To improve stakeholder knowledge and awareness of gender equality issues within the STEM sector by engaging a minimum of 200 unique employer and educator participants in a bespoke training programme. \r\n2. To engage a minimum of 2000 stakeholders in web based activity over the lifespan of the project including website access, social media interactions, engagement with best practice guides and other project outputs.\r\n3. To support a minimum of 60 SME employers (20 per country) in using the Gender Equality Self-Assessment Diagnostic Toolkit to assess their progress with respect to recruitment, retention and advancement policies and practice, and produce a bespoke assessment report that is tailored to their individual needs.\r\n4. To increase the average number of females recruited by participating employers by 10% (relative to baseline) by the end of the project.\r\n\r\nThe project partners include City of Glasgow College (Scotland), VHTO (Netherlands), Miguel Altuna Instituta (Spain) and EQUATE Scotland (Scotland). All project partners were chosen in response to a demonstrated track record of promoting gender equality within the STEM and associated sectors as well as experience of working in large externally funded collaborative projects.\r\n\r\nParticipants are primarily drawn from the employer networks of participating organisations although additional employers will be engaged by the project team throughout the lifespan of the project. Additional participants include educators, policy makers, employer representatives, third sector and charitable workers and young people.

Its name should be understood as \u201cDecisionShip Ahoy!\u201d, a reference to A. G. Bell, the Scottish-born scientist who patented the first telephone and originally suggested 'Ahoy' as the standard greeting when answering a call. Its purpose is to investigate, over 3 years, innovative educational ideas around Decision Making, with a view to deeply reinforcing Decision Making skills for renewed and rejuvenated integrative educational programmes in Higher Education (HE) and Vocational Education & Training (VET), and promoting the internal exploitation and intensive dissemination of such framework, for continuous development of HE and VET practices. \r\n\r\nThe nature and dynamics of change creates unpredictability in the European society. Professional life environments are more than ever Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA). This context makes decisions even more strategically critical. Entrepreneurship and Leadership skills have been extensively investigated during the last decade to meet EU Modernisation Agenda strategies It is now time to explore \u201cDecisionship\u201d. Yet, decision is not only about knowledge, it is also about skills. Whether they are to act as experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths (STEM) or other fields, future Decision Makers should also be specifically prepared to making decisions in VUCA environments. This is the responsibility of HE and VET institutions: training future graduates, through a transversal skills approach, in Decisionship, so that they are able to turn knowledge into skills, and provide the best professional answer when faced with VUCA circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe first innovative aspect of D'Ahoy is to support the coherent inclusion of active and engaging pedagogical models. The second is to investigate Decision Making as a transversal skill, in association with three complementary dimensions:\r\n* Maths-based Decision Making, with rationality;\r\n* Social-based Decision Making, including people\u2019s interdependencies and social identities;\r\n* Career-based Decision Making, to better choose owns career path.\r\n\r\nD'Ahoy is grounded in a clearer understanding of the perceptions and expectations of students and fully aligned with the strategic challenges of the partners to accelerate pedagogical innovations and nucleate their HE and VET systems. Through an exchanges of best practices among Schools, in the STEM and Business fields, D'Ahoy seeks (i) to share and confront HE educational innovations, practices and methods, in light of professional needs, (ii) to catalyse the engagement of learners with innovative courses, integrated in existing but evolving programmes, through novel educational initiatives, (iii) to develop and disseminate tools for assessment of such skills, via the learning outcomes approach, and (iv) to assesses their quality and achievements. D'Ahoy exploits and complements prior EU and national project results (FP7, H2020, LLP, Erasmus+ KA2, or French-like ANR) to create inclusive, active and experiential pedagogies for Decision Making skills, so as to render education systems more accessible and attractive.\r\n\r\nD'Ahoy aims at defining and evaluating innovative Teaching and Learning activities to be integrated in educational frameworks at a systemic level, in line with the Bologna processes and quality assurance purposes, as ENQA and EQAVET recommendations for accreditation and quality enhancement. D'Ahoy will bring positive and long-lasting effects on the participating organisations and their staff and learners, and on other regional, national and European Institutions as formalized in its 8 target groups. It will output 3 guides, a Youtube channel, several publications and conference presentations. The guides include:\r\n1. a taxonomy of Decision skills requirements and unified learning outcomes syllabus;\r\n2. innovative models and kits for Decision skill training, transferable in many educational fields;\r\n3. a D-SKILLS Framework, continuously integrative for programmes renewal. \r\n\r\nThe D'Ahoy partnership consists of a consortium of 7 top level expert partners (in France, Scotland, Spain, and Iceland) with a complementary expertise in Decision and specific expertise in HE and VET educational development, to produce high quality outputs. Including a national qualification framework partner, D'Ahoy promotes solutions for the recognition of competency acquired through innovative courses. With regard to the Career Decision Making dimension, as regional uncertain employment contexts exist, D'Ahoy should facilitate transitions between education and the labour market, and reinforces labour mobility.

Lack of internships and other professional training opportunities during studies, among others, lead to discouragement, lack of motivation and inactivity among the youth. Large group of GE and KG youth is losing their potential to put their creative ideas into product and create self-employment. Therefore, there is a need for more formal and non-formal education activities aimed at strengthening entrepreneurial capacity of students and graduates. These activities are often unavailable or inaccessible in due to the lack of competencies and relevant experience within HEIs. Systemic approach in incorporating entrepreneurship modules within study programs at GE and KG HEIs will have positive impact on the above mentioned issues, however, qualified and trained professors ready to introduce innovative methods of teaching into their curricula are also necessary. Another aspect is lack of guidance and mentoring which can be seen as a problem as it contributes to decreased involvement of youth in economic activities. Guidance and trainings are essential for already graduated students as well in order to help them fully make use of their potential and knowledge received during their studies.Within this context, the aim of optimization of HEIs are reform of HE system, adaptation it to the new economic environment and increasing the efficient use of material and human resources of universities. HEIs should review their own training process  of graduates so that they can provide well formed and competent graduates who will be contribute actively to the development of their national economies.This project thus is concrete response to these attempts of reform.
