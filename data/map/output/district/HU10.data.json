Aim of this project is to improve the knowledge and skills of the staff there are working in accessibility adult education field. Within this project will be the staffs of authorized institutions for accessibility field  in Europen countrys about accessibility trained. The total number of participants of the project is 36. The participants are from accessibility monitoring and supervisory committee members, social service workers, municipal employees, and representatives of associations for disabilities.These participants are giving training and guidance for the implementation of standards  in accessibility and they provide training in independent living for disabled people. The participants will attend to structured courses in the UK and Ireland. And participate will be monitoring of the job activities in Sweden. Within the developing of knowledge and skills of the participants they will be make better guidances, orientations and trainings, so they will inform and train his studends better in this way will the accessibility implementation in Amasya developed.

The focus being on developing entry-level curriculum (particularly for young people) to enable them to develop their skills and competencies to understand the principles of robotics and 3D printing and their widespread application in industry in order for them to access jobs in these new-age industrial sectors. Robotics is a fast developing market increasingly driven by the development of novel and improved products in areas as diverse as manufacturing, search and rescue and retrieval, inspection and monitoring, surgery and healthcare, homes and cars, transport and logistics, agriculture, and many more.The rapid increase in the use of robots in our homes and at work, in hospitals and industrial environments provides an inspiring vision about how they can benefit society as a whole and how priorities to stimulate robotics should be defined at this point in their evolution, to best develop the potential for growth, jobs and innovation in Europe.Europe is one of the world leading regions in industrial robotics with a share of more than 25% of supply and use. The growth of the sector is expected to be more 6 % per year in the next 3 years to reach more than 32 B$ by 2016. Growth and job creation goes along with innovative scientific developments. Current focus includes science-based understanding of robotics abilities, alongside with improved technology and use-oriented innovation that is fit for purpose. It is estimated that each industrial robot needs at least 4 people to run, maintain and service it.Verbal reports from industry, as well as the presence of constant job openings, indicate industry is having difficulty finding software engineering talent to develop and maintain their software systems. This project will promote best practice and encourage the use of existing training materials, whilst at the same time developing appropriate Training Modules that are required, as identified by the Mapping Exercise. Around 300 people will benefit indirectly from the Project with around 250 direct beneficiaries e.g. attending the end of Project Workshop/Competition, those involved in the original Survey exercise and website registrations.The general results of this project will be: \u2022 Benchmarking: The Project will need to include some desk based work initially to cover the field i.e. the literature of what basic robotics/3D printing training is available, what is known and researched i.e. benchmark work; (a) identify the current techniques/training programmes and (b) understand their value and usage.\u2022 Analytical activities: Carrying out a European survey and data collection activity on the use and value of robotic and 3D printing training among young people and identifying good practice. \u2022 Training activities: Development of appropriate training modules for use by training institutions with the expectation that they will adapt/modify the modules to their required needs and add to existing training programme already available.\u2022 Mutual learning, exchange of good practices, cooperation: The promotion and dissemination of good practices of training at a European level as determined by the \u201cAnalytical Activities\u201d.The overall impact of the Project will be the direct promotion of  appropriate \"New Age Training\" Courses - including robotics/3D printing  - as a viable way of managing the growing needs of employers in the area of new age technologies.Considering short, medium and long term impacts, the Project aims at providing the opportunity to develop and foster the interest (particularly by young people) in \u201cNew Age Technologies\u201d and offer the opportunity to training institutions to undertake appropriate introductory training with a view to assisting young people to secure employment in this fast developing highly skilled sector of the European economy.", "http://www.eu15.co.uk", "EU15 Ltd", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024437_coordinator"], ["7EX", "EDUCATION - THE CHALLENGE OF THE LATER YEARS", "T.F.E.I.

The duration of the project is 2 years. Flexible partnership will be characterised by a flexible work system with partners The project proposal is based on the permanent analysis, existing knowledge, know- how and practice.\r\n\r\nThe target group consists of elderly people who need wider range of educational activities.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to create training materials for educators in the areas of leisure, hobbies, health, talent development and transmission of  values.\r\n\r\nElderly people meet a number of barriers making their come back to learning difficult. The barriers may be:- perceiving oneself as too old -fragile health, -  commuting difficulties - lack of companion, - too little information.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, psychological research on the education of older people was dominated by the deficit model . This model describes the process of aging by means of reduced cognitive and intellectual abilities . \r\n\r\nCurrently the attentions is rather put on the resources available for older people. \r\n\r\nThe project responds to the needs of :\r\n\r\n- Education based on realistic problems - seeking and finding solutions to problems.\r\n\r\n- Support in dealing with critical moments in adults\u2019 lives - immersion in the professional development and growth, \r\n\r\n- Acquiring new knowledge and skills,\r\n\r\n- Overcoming anxiety, fear and shyness in some cases\r\n\r\n- Inspiring, encouraging and motivating .\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are  teachers , coaches and workers for partner organizations..The main objective of the project is to improve learning opportunities for older people in partner countries. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are :\r\n\r\n- To increase the education of the third and fourth age people\r\n\r\n- To improve the social acceptance for the period of old age as a stage of life.\r\n\r\n- To Develop cooperation between institutions and to gain greater potency .\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project have been identified and can be reached on the nature and experience of partnership.
