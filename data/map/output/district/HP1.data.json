Distribution and transmission grids and power system architectures still follow planning rules and procedures defined for the traditional operational paradigm. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and prepare solutions for the operational problems that will be caused on the electric grid, to the generation sub-system and to its commercial operation as a result of progressively increasing deployment of EV. The conceptual approach in this project involves the development of a methodology consisting of two synergetic pathways: - Development of a management and control concept that will facilitate the actual transition \u2013 the MERGE concept; - Development of an evaluation suite that consists of methods and programs of modeling, analysis, and optimization of electric networks into which electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure is integrated. The MERGE concept is inspired from consideration of DER deployment but differs in that we consider now the resources to be mobile in terms of their connection to the grid. Analogies will be derived and adapted to the case of mobile resources, which can be either consumers (when in charging mode) or injectors of power (if batteries are delivering power back to the grid). By exploiting a specific computational evaluation suite that is capable of simulating real world power systems (generation, transmission and distribution) for either steady state or dynamic behavior it will be possible to test the adequacy of EV preliminary smart control interfaces that will be developed in the project. It will address comprehensively the impact of EV presence regarding steady state operation, intermittent RES integration, system stability and dynamic behavior, system restoration, regulatory aspects and market arrangements.", 35050.0, 3836136.0, "MERGE", "Electric vehicles charging ahead", "Electric vehicles charging ahead", "Widespread market uptake of hybrid and all-electric vehicles, further considered together as electric vehicles requires careful consideration of the future operation of current electric power systems. Understanding and comparing the impact of such integration given uncontrolled conditions through a careful framework was the purpose of the EU-funded project 'Mobile energy resources in grids of electricity' (http://www.ev-merge.eu/ (MERGE)) . \n\nScientists considered the relevant infrastructure including charging concepts, smart metering and communication technologies.  Advanced simulation tools were then developed to assess the technical, economic and environmental aspects of electric vehicle integration in a holistic way. The study included analysis of steady-state and dynamic behaviours, the use of intermittent renewable energy resources and system stability and restoration schemes. Further, researchers considered regulatory issues, business models and market impact.\n\nOutcomes enabled the team to formulate several concepts for management of large-scale electric vehicle integration including business models and communication schemes. Partners concluded that, while no significant technical problems are expected until 2020 regardless of the charging strategy adopted, this is not the case by 2030. Development of an optimised and standardised charging infrastructure and planned regulatory framework will be necessary to avoid costly investments in network reinforcements. However, scientists emphasised that vehicle owner conformity should always be voluntary, highlighting the need for appropriate incentives. Researchers concluded with policy and regulatory recommendations for the present, intermediate- and long-term integration of electric vehicles.\n\nMERGE has provided the tools necessary to evaluate the operational issues associated with widespread market uptake of electric vehicles. Optimising integration will reduce technical and economic problems in the near future for maximum positive impact.

As a result, young people are often socially excluded and have difficulty participating actively.One of the main reasons why we want to pursue this project is to promote the concept of social entrepreneurship for young people across Europe. The idea is that participants are able to use all the information acquired during the exchange and begin to think about their future career and all the possibilities that they have to create their own future.The objectives of the project are:- Provide young people with the opportunity to develop or improve their basic and transversl skills, such as entrepreneurship, digital skills, teamwork, creativity and multilingualism providing the theoretical and practical means to facilitate the resourcefulness of the youngsters with creative processes and business in order to facilitate their employment, also in relation to other areas of Europe.- Promote social inclusion; will participate in the exchange young people with fewer opportunities, youngsters who have financial problems or are in a state of inactivity or unemployment. Many times the people who are in these situations are those who are less willing to participate in certain activities with other ypung people, probably due to a conditioned reflex of their economic situation;- Encourage their active citizenship and participation in society, encouraging young people to take active and enterprising attitudes not only in their communities but also in Europe.

Europe has become the place to move and interact exercising their rights.Participants involved in the project are 36, aged between 18 and 30 years who are dealing with the world of work for a short time, and young people who are looking for a new job or unemployed; boys who have finished high school and are facing with a number of choices such as the university, the search for a job, experience abroad, creating their own work; youngsters who feel an uncomfortable situation for the job, with many unknowns about it and how to build their career.

Storytelling will help refugees by empowering them, facilitating communication and inspiring their personal growth. Telling their own story in a secure environment will reassure them the values as a person, widden the chances of meeting new people and being offered work opportunities. This approach will affect also the audience, the hosting society. In this way the listener will be active in the equal level as the storyteller, will be involved in their personal life story and raise the comprehensive behaviour.The project will start with a research in order  to get a clear picture of the storytelling methods mostly applied and main actors involved. This will serve to the further development of each step of the project and its respective IO-s.The core of the project are the training modules and the validation system. In this context of activities, the first step will be the development of the storytelling training curricula and modules which will be further developed by each partner due to their expertise. Then a validation system will be designed, to recognize and certificate the storytelling competences developed by the trainers and multipliers.  For this purpose, the LEVEL5 validation system will have to be further developed and customised to the specific needs of the project.

Once the first draft products (training modules and validation system) have been developed, they will be tested during a well structured piloting phase.  The piloting phase will be preceded by a five-day European training course (C1) for trainers and multipliers, to get to know the LISTEN concept and to learn how to apply it in real training contexts with refugees.

We will create an active social media group to enable participants to exchange ideas and have a support platform to contribute to their ongoing professional development. \r\n\r\nThe project has a strong commitment to ensuring outcomes are actively disseminated so all organisations can draw on our results to improve how they can use cultural diversity as a tool in engaging young people. We will produce a Good Practice Guide drawing on current partner work and the new ideas developed through the programme of co-operation. The Guide will include written material, videos led by young people. We will research existing diversity training and look to create a new approach and ideas, rather than just replicate what is already available.  We will disseminate through partner websites, social media, events attended and their extensive European Project networks, with the aim of contributing to the research and development of future policy in this field. \r\n\r\nThe longer term benefit of the project is to equip youth workers with a suite of new ideas to enable young people to value and have positive opinions relating to cultural diversity. Open minds are an important part of a healthy society and we will add to the partner skills to play their role in creating these outcomes for their communities. Combining staff / volunteers and young people as participants in the journey will also enable a wider audience benefiting from the sharing of good practice which will feed into the resources available to make a positive sustainable difference to the outlook and opinions of young people.\r\n\r\nAdditional and very key future benefit will relate to active ongoing co-operation between partners to develop the content and outcomes of this project for the benefit of young people.", "http://www.communityactiondacorum.org.uk", "DACORUM COUNCIL FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICE LTD", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA205-035140_coordinator"], ["3AF", "SOCIAL ENTERPRISE SHARING BEST PRACTICE AS A TOOL IN YOUTH WORK", "DACORUM COUNCIL FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICE LTD", 154340.0, "From European to local level Social Enterprise is recognised as having a valuable contribution to make in building social cohesion / wellbeing and economic growth. The Social Enterprise Sharing Best Practice as a Tool in Youth Work project has been designed collectively by all partners to provide an innovative and valued contribution to promoting the concept of Social Enterprise, showcasing how it can be used creatively in youth work and as a result equip young people with skills to use in the workplace and wider society.\r\n\r\nEight partners from six countries will work closely together to achieve the project aims and objectives; which is to share best practice between partners and through active dissemination with a wider audience. This will be achieved through a programme of seven short-term training events attended by all partners, where the host will share their work and that of local stakeholders in the fields of social enterprise and youth work. With a diverse partner selection, we will have the added value of partners sharing their own expertise (NSHC - refugees and asylum seekers, AC Sportiv Experieta Multisport in using sport as engagement tool, AMACH! LGBT in transgender work, Stephens & George in low literacy level projects, Dacorum CVS in school enterprise challenges, Solna Youth Center and statutarni mesto Karvina on municipality led enterprise initiatives and policy setting and Petriklic help in environmental initiatives). \r\n\r\nThe project will build the capacity of partners to engage at all geographic areas from local to European and enable partners new to transnational activity to experience the values of this form of learning. Partners will be more empowered, individual participants selected by partners will benefit from an important professional development opportunity. Young people from partner localities will benefit from enhanced provision resulting from piloting and mainstreaming new methodologies learned from the engagement, sharing and learning with partner. \r\n\r\nActive dissemination to raise the project profile will be continuous throughout the project, as will evaluation / monitoring to ensure we maximise learning and outcomes. From the programme of seven training courses we will identify examples of good practice and showcase the results in the publication of Good Practice Guide on Social Enterprise as a Tool in Youth Work. This will ensure that the knowledge gained by partners is effectively shared at project conclusion to inform and inspire other organisations from all sectors across Europe on how they engage with young people and pass onto them valuable skills in the field of social enterprise / entreprenurship / active citizenship", "http://www.communityactiondacorum.org.uk", "DACORUM COUNCIL FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICE LTD", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA205-046425_coordinator"], ["3AF", "E+ Round Trip Online Preparation for Young People", "DACORUM COUNCIL FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICE LTD", 115620.0, "This project is the third part of a trilogy which started with \u201dThe suitcase, the map and the voyage of a youth worker\u201d which had great positive results in terms of indicators, continued with \u201cOnline Training Courses for E+ Youth Workers\u201d in order to arrive now to a more modern, dynamic, committed and professional environment and takes the results on a higher level and connect them with young people as well.\r\n\r\nThe partnership is set to create an increased capacity and new level of work professionalism at EU/international level in the field of youth.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, 4 main objectives have been set for 2 years of the project: \r\n1. Exploration by 150 young people of an online pre-departure training built for future European volunteers;\r\n2. Improving the preparation for potential future youth exchanges of 150 youngsters \u2013 participants in a dedicated online course;\r\n3. Increase the valorisation capabilities of 150 people - participants in the proposed online module and potential participants in experiences abroad;\r\n\r\nThese online tools that are to be developed in the project will be integrated in an online learning platform and will have at least the following items included:\r\n\u2022\tIntroductory assessment (compulsory for participant before starting the course);\r\n\u2022\tMap/Mind map/Graph with the main aspects/topics to be considered for preparation;\r\n\u2022\tTheoretical part for each chapter in the form of an e-book;\r\n\u2022\tShort movies explaining the theory, making it more attractive;\r\n\u2022\tA catalogue with real-life examples emphasizing how new knowledge can be applied;\r\n\u2022\tMinimum bibliography to consult \u2013 websites with text/video, talks, online free books etc \u2013 providing links to resources to read/watch;\r\n\u2022\tMissions/Tasks to be done in order to apply the theory of the module/chapter \u2013 supplementary work for the participant \u2013 to do research, to apply, to create, to transfer into practice what has been learnt;\r\n\u2022\tFinal assessment \u2013 as part of the assessment and evaluation process;\r\n\u2022\tBadge award;\r\n\u2022\tThe feedback questionnaires;\r\n\u2022\tPeer evaluation; \r\n\u2022\tTeam work ;\r\n\u2022\tPresentation area;\r\n\u2022\tForum. \r\n\r\nIn terms of developed competences, each course/module on the learning platform will have main competences associated, i.e. by successfully completing modules, participants will develop/acquire certain competences. Upon successful completion of the course, the participant will receive an online certificate stating the main themes/activities covered and the acquired competences.\r\n\r\nThe main beneficiaries of these online tools will be 450 young people considering having an experience abroad \u2013 EUROPEAN VOLUNTEERING, youth mobility, repatriates. They will be provided necessary orientation and training to get the most out of their international experience, as follows: 150 participants in the first online training course will develop competences necessary in EUROPEAN VOLUNTEERING experiences; 150 participants in the second online training course will develop competences necessary in contexts like youth exchanges;   150 participants in the fourth online course will develop competences necessary in managing reverse culture shock and giving valorisation to their international experience after coming back in the sending country. In the long run, they can make use of their newly acquired knowledge and skills in future endeavours involving intercultural events and activities.\r\n\r\nThe \u201eE+ ROUND TRIP\u201d platform, hosting innovative and practical online tools for orientation and preparation, useful in all kinds of projects devoted to working with youth (youth exchanges, EUROPEAN VOLUNTEERING ) will also function as database for future actions.

It becomes more and more important in the face of other social structures becoming weaker. This kind of sociality is today in great danger because of the society changes.Within this context the project intends to develop the theme of community development through sports. Sport and sports-related activities are, in fact, an element that can help with community development, when:- they focus on the entertainment in playing and in meeting others instead of simple, pure competition;- there\u2019s a choice of multiple sport disciplines and motor activities that can involve the largest possible number of people, intercepting different interests, generations and social classes;- sports might become community development when they provide opportunities to facilitate processes of change that are real and effective.Our project aims to create an original methodology that combines sports and an approach to community development, producing a didactic module that might allow operators and volunteers to become development facilitators in communities, throughout sports.The community development that we wish to promote will focus on the abilities within the community to self-organize sports practices, with the aim of favoring inclusion and intercultural exchange, equal opportunities, and the members\u2019 psychophysical well-being.The targets of the project are:- Volunteers working in the field of sports, who are investing effort in the development of their own community;- Sports operators interested in broadening their skills and knowledge in the field of community development throughout sports activities;- Educators who operate through sports activities in order to facilitate social inclusion and community development;- Civil society organizations that are active in promoting their territories throughout sports.", "http://www.communityactiondacorum.org.uk", null, "erasmus_579798-EPP-1-2016-1-IT-SPO-SSCP_2"], ["3AF", "Sport for intercultural dialogue", "DACORUM COUNCIL FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICE LTD", 233159.0, "Football, and all team sports, allow refugees, migrants and asylum seekers to establish a contact with their local environment and to meet local associations and groups of which the usually don\u2019t feel a part and toward which they don\u2019t seek an active participation.
