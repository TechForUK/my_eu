They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition. It is noteworthy that all of the components characterising the Physical Frailty and Sarcopenia (PF&S) model are measurable and qua", null, 41731203.0, "SPRINTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.niche.org.uk", null, "fp7_203718_964674313"], ["6QF", "Elimination of NOx, SOx and Particulates in Rail Transportation", "Fluid Technologies (Environmental) Ltd", "Locomotive engines are significant contributors to air pollution in many cities and ports. Although locomotive engines being produced today must meet relatively modest emission requirements set in 1997, they continue to emit large amounts of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (PM).\nThe 2008 Clean Air Non-road Diesel Rule stipulates new requirements for non-road diesel fuel that will decrease the allowable levels of sulphur in fuel used in locomotives by 99 percent. These fuel improvements will create immediate and significant environmental and public health benefits by reducing PM from existing engines. The rule also establishes long-term, Tier 4, standards for newly-built engines based on the application of high-efficiency catalytic aftertreatment technology, beginning in 2015.\nAlthough established Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) processes appear effective, there remain several problems such as high reaction temperatures, which sometimes require reheating of the flue gas, a large reactor volume, and the need for reductant ammonia. In addition, the process is not applicable to NO in low concentrations and at ambient temperature. As NO2 is easily removed by water, catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 at a low temperature is a promising way of removing NO in flue gas without using ammonia.\nIn the ENSPIRIT project, the core research work will focus on the production of a pre-production prototype catalytic device for NO oxidation over Activated Carbon at ambient temperature.

The end products are a teachers manual for this new approach - including an analysis of students\u2019 needs and the monitoring of individual language acquisition processes - and learners\u2019 tutorials, in which learners link their error patterns (the \u201cguerilla\u201d) to the correct ways of language use. Based on connectivist pedagogical approaches, this remedial work is linked to both formal and informal learning environments (from libraries to community schools to digital spaces) and to multilingual acquisition.\r\n\r\nBasic literacy levels are problematic throughout Europe in the twenty-first century, resulting in an ever increasing group of citizens that drop out of school prematurely and risk becoming marginalised, unemployed and impoverished. However, it is our working hypothesis that these drop-outs can teach us new ways of acquiring literacy. \r\n\r\nThis new approach is based on a pilot project at the Catholic University College Limburg (CLUC) that explored how students can become proficient writers through creating video clips in which they show which guerilla tactics they use (make mistakes) and how they remediate them. In these tutorials, students discussed the guerilla patterns which emerged through thinking aloud exercises. At CLUC, we have termed this process guerrilla literacy, since the students guessed, mixed rules unorthodoxically, applied rules in the wrong contexts, and applied mathematical logics to solve linguistic challenges. We observed that once students could link their errors to a guerrilla pattern, it was easier for them to correct the mistake.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed project, we will develop a guerrilla methodology through: testing, mind-mapping, digital thinking aloud exercises, describing emerging guerrilla patterns, creating knowledge clips and sharing them in a MOOC. Next, we ask students to link their error patterns to structures in other languages. The rationale behind this is that most people do not speak standard languages. They speak regional alternatives or another (European) language or an idiolectal L2. Again it is our working hypothesis that if we allow learners to compare two or more linguistic systems and focus on the differences, their basic literacies will improve.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in our CLUC pilot project we realized we had to \u201cunlock\u201d learners with literacy difficulties through narratives.

In the Grundtvig project L2LByTe we embraced the Flipped class concept asking our adult learners to create knowledge clips about dances and songs, traditions and food and drink.

New partners have been invited to strengthen the link with teacher education. The idea is to create a mix between teachers who teach in formal and non-formal adult education on the one hand and teachers who work in teacher training departments.

The EU topic \"Accessible Tourism for All\" very clearly reflects this trend. An insufficient awareness by tourism providers both on policy and public as well as on the level of micro and small tourism enterprises towards the personnel skills, qualification and competence requests of the promising \u201cAccessible Tourism for All\u201d is to note. New requirements of professional qualification and first of personal competencies arise that the management and the staff have to face qualitatively and quantitatively to meet new customer target groups and their very specific needs.Tailor-made training and continuing education for managers and employees in the tourism industry is important to enable them to cater effectively for guests with special needs and to provide high-quality tourism offers.Objectives: The action\u2019s main objective is to respond to the needs of the tourism labour market, especially to the needs of smallest and SMEs as well as to anticipate qualification and training needs in the \u201cAccessible Tourism for All\u201d sector. This will done by the exchange of specific good practices and experiences in qualification and training gained in the participating countries in this area.Specific Objectives are the exchange of practices about:- Job qualification in high-priced quality tourism regions and tourism cluster development,  - Accessible tourism, especially for people from ethnic minorities including migrants and in opening up entrepreneurship opportunities for people in those groups, - What the managers should know about accessible tourism?, and- Tourism programmes for 3rd age.Participants: Six partners from Germany, Federal Land Brandenburg, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Spain, Latvia and Greece are involved in this action. They represent different stakeholders like Regional Development Agencies, a National University, and Foundations.The project foresees the involvement of round about 30 direct (with a specific grant) and 120 indirect (without a specific grant) persons and some 600 other interested local persons/stakeholders reached by measures of the media and non-media activities either as direct or indirect beneficiaries. Target groups are: - Managers and staff of regional smallest tourism and SMEs,- People working in the field of education policy- Local and tourism departments of regional administrations,- Key regional and national thematic networks and clusters,- Regional representatives of VET and training institutions,- Persons disadvantaged at the labour market, especially women, elderly, migrants, etc.Activities: The action foresees:- 6 \u201cTransnational Meetings\u201d, - 6 \u201cExchanges of Practices\u201d in the format of Blended Mobility (5 days each), meant to share/confront ideas, practices and methods by the directly involved partner\u2019s beneficiaries. In addition, they should develop and reinforce networks and increase their capacity to operate at transnational level.Methodology: The action use the following methodologies:-  Lead Partner principle, - \u201cTransfer of contents\u201d of proven procedures, methods and approaches, - \u201cCapacity building\u201d and \u201cCommon learning and training\u201d during the \u201cTransnational Meetings\u201d and \u201cBlended Mobility\u201d.Results/impact: The action will have not-tangible results. They are materialised in capacity building in how in general \u201cAccessible Tourism for All\u201d is organised in accordance to the needs and behaviours of different target groups, i.e. persons with special handicaps, elderly persons, families with children, ethnic minorities, migrants etc. and which complex approaches are used in the participating countries. That capacity building includes a better know-ledge about existing good practices and strengthened interpersonal, intercultural, social and civic competences. This expected impact, i.e. enhanced expertise and skills in \u201cAccessible Tourism All\u201d would manifest itself in a mid- and long-term range on personal, competence, know-ledge and organisational levels.Longer-term benefits/European added value: The shared good practices on wide aspects in \u201cAccessible Tourism for All\u201d will remain after the end of the EU funding and will be integrated into the regional educational systems and in the daily entrepreneurial practise. The upgraded expertise of the direct and indirect action beneficiaries on the \u201cAccessible Tourism for All\u201d concept and the raised European competencies and behaviours of action participants remain for long periods.

It is an ongoing development of viscerally exciting theatre in Nordic Countries aiming at a large-scale immersive performance in a non-traditional venue. We are devising an original show based on the life and work of Lewis Carroll and his Alice in Wonderland. The production in centered around questions of identity and the shaping of ones identity, as Alice encounters various creatures and events that form her notion of her Self. We long to question what influences our formation of identity through a playful use of autobiographical events, scenes from the author's - Dodgeson\u2019s - own life. \r\n\r\nOur script of new writing and editing of Carroll's work will require a thorough research into the renowned UK author, which we intend to communicate through our performance. The performance will modernise the work and interpret it for the modern audiences by highlighting the key themes and recontextualising the characters that Alice encounters. The notion of identity and confrontation is of an increasing importance in our ever-more isolating society, and with the changes in rules and regulations following the economic crisis there have been drastic changes to acceptable behaviour around the world. We long to capture and investigate the various changes within society, events and characters in an individual's life that come to shape our identity, and through this confront the audiences through participatory elements, highly visual theatre, and playful interpretations of Carroll's absurdist storytelling style.\r\n\r\n\u2018Carroll Berserk\u2019 is Spindrift Theatre\u2019s UK debut of a full-length theatre performance and is a crucial part of the company\u2019s early stage of establishment within the creative industry, firstly as theatre-makers in the process of identifying our artistic position/niche and testing our work in order to keep developing our approach to creating innovative and engaging performance art. Secondly, this is a critical stage for the company as professionals building futile relationships and network. We are already collaborating with several other artists, with various seniority within the industry, establishing relationships with other emerging artists, as well as being mentored by well-established industry professionals, such as the partnership with Drayton Arms Theatre. We aim to invite theatre directors and other influential industry professionals to the performance in the hope of being programmed in other London/UK venues and allow for the development of the performance, ensuring its continuation and constant innovation and outreach. Project funding is vital at this stage to ensure the required standard and quality of product in order to achieve the previous aims.\r\n \r\nThis project will also test the reception of our Nordic heritage and culture on stage, and we will be able to gage the market for it and by appropriate evaluation of feedback develop our approach in order to best reach our audience. The company aims to establish long-lasting partnerships with the Nordic embassies in London, as a way of reaching the Nordic population of the UK, and equally aid the cross-border relationships. Spindrift Theatre\u2019s members ((both applying and partner organisations) will be the facilitators of the project, as well as performing, composing and designing in the production.\r\n \r\nWe are developing the draft of our script, and will create a production in our rehearsal period in June/July this year in London. We have received in-kind rehearsal space from Theatre Delicatessen, Chamenos Collective, the Finnish Church and the Norwegian Church for that period. This production will premiere in a one week run at the Drayton Arms Theatre in London in August. \r\n\r\nFrom there we want to start to develop the performance, the two organisations working together as one starting on the 1. September and transform the production already performed and tested out in theatrical space, into a full length tour-ready work. The project includes 4 weeks of rehearsal and development, the purchase of production elements (set, costume, props, and technical equipment), the organisation of public performances, the creation of tour pack, info pack, to send to prospective touring venues as well as the development of an education programme that would run alongside any future touring performances.", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-IS02-KA205-001517_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6QJ", "VOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS*", 487327.0, "EU Aid Volunteers initiative \u2014 Strengthening the Union\u2019s capacity to respond to humanitarian crises (23.04.01)", "fts_2017_28463", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["7EG", "RAX", "New Victoria Hospital"], ["7QB", "RAX", "Kingston Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KT2"}
