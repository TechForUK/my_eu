While these technologies offer some attraction to large scale enterprises, the ability of SMEs to afford this technology makes them an impractical solution. Furthermore these new heat treatment methods affect the chemical and physical structure of the timber, making it more brittle and reducing its physical strength while chemical preservation means that timber can only be used in external applications. We propose the development of a cost effective 2 stage system, firstly, the heat treatment process which will preserve the timber will use a novel microwave based technology to directly heat the timber. Secondly the development of a natural oil formulation to be applied directly to the hot timber within the heating chamber which will restore the natural mechanical and physical properties and maximise the opportunities.

To achieve this, the BACCHUS consortium has assembled 12 leading Research & Technological centres and 16 SMEs (with ca 30% of the EC requested contribution allocated to the SMEs). BACCHUS thus contains SMEs directly involved in developing food products and pursuing health claims, experts in health claims legislation and the EFSA review process, and academic and industry partners who provide high quality food and health research that can underpin health claims. Existing SME-developed products that have clear potential for obtaining favourable opinions for health claims have been selected as test cases for study. These have been aligned with a series of work-packages each of which addresses key aspects of the EFSA health claim evaluation process (legislation and dossiers; product/bioactive characterisation; habitual intakes; bioavailability; mechanisms and biomarkers; clinical trials evidence of health benefit) that will deliver tools, processes and high quality original science. Scientific results and best practice guidelines will be made publically available and thus support future claims for industry. The scope and completeness of the existing bioactive database (eBASIS) that includes both compositional and biological effects data will be extended and developed as a sustainable tool with various training materials. All outcomes will be disseminated broadly by direct engagement with SMEs via an existing European SME association, with stakeholders via seminars, newsletters and press releases, as well as through traditional scientific routes (high quality publications, and conference presentations).", 33899.0, 6079481.0, "BACCHUS", "Improving SME access to health claims", "Risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be reduced, particularly with consumption of foods rich in bioactive (non-nutrient) components such as polyphenols.

However, very few European companies are exploiting this knowledge meaning the benefits are not being passed on to consumers. Issues  in obtaining health claims include inappropriate study design, poor characterisation of active substances, and failure to demonstrate dose-related effect in healthy individuals. 'Beneficial effects of dietary bioactive peptides and polyphenols on cardiovascular health in humans' (http://bacchus-fp7.eu/ (BACCHUS)) is developing tools and resources to help SMEs submit better health claim dossiers for bioactive food components in existing and future products.\n\nDuring the first project period, project members published best practice guidelines for health claim dossiers, based on information that, whilst publically available, is in practice difficult to find and interpret.\n\nEthical approval was obtained for six phase II randomised clinical trials to test the effects of bioactive components in humans. The aim is to demonstrate an impact on health markers such as blood pressure, but also how RCTs should be undertaken for food compounds. Prior to these studies, the compounds/foods being tested in the trials were developed and fully characterised. In vitro models for determining bioavailability, absorption and metabolism of the tested compounds have been developed and assessed. Metabolites of the bioactive compounds from these models, plus some that have already been synthesised during the project, will be assessed for their mechanisms of action in vitro. Models and protocols for establishing their effects, such as oxidative stress and platelet activity, have also been set-up and tested.\n\nhttp://ebasis.eurofir.org (eBASIS), a unique database that contains critically evaluated published data on the content and biological effects of bioactive constituents in plant based foods has been extended to incorporate data on meats, specifically bioactive peptides. A prototype tool, linking the information in eBASIS on bioactive content in fruits with food intake data from some EU countries has been developed. The tool allows the user to model the effects of making small dietary changes (e.g. increased berry consumption)on bioactive intake at a population level.\n\nTogether with targeted dissemination for SMEs, outputs such as the best practice guidelines and tools for assessing intakes are being made available to SMEs and researchers with an interest in potential health claim dossiers through an e-learning platform that has been established in the initial phase of the project. This will support development of products and ensure consumers have access to foods with validated health claims, which has significant socioeconomic benefits for public health and a knowledge-based bioeconomy.", "http://www.bacchus-fp7.eu/", null, "/docs/results/images/2015/157182.jpg", "fp7_104530_992434064"], ["9NR", "Safety and Efficacy of a New and Emerging Dental X-ray Modality", "Leeds Test Objects Limited", "The aim of this proposal is the acquisition of the key information necessary for sound and scientifically based clinical use of dental Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT).

The HTL Hallein and it's partner schools will provide work placements abroad. These internships should give the students the opportunity to learn for their future careers and also to do a lot for their individual development. Managing their everyday life abroad is a new experience for most of the students . Organizing living, food, public transport, etc. is a great challenge for them.In the summer holiday 2016, 10 students of the HTL Hallein will do their interships abroad. Therefore the HTL Hallein established partnerships with different schools in England and the Netherlands. Every partner has to organize the internships for the students coming from abroad. HTL Hallein looks for companies which can provide internships in the greater area of Salzburg. In June/July and September/October students from Sheffield and Drachten will come to Hallein and teachers of the HTL Hallein will support these students during their stay here in Hallein. The cooperation between the schools from Sheffield, Drachten and Hallein was established in the last years during different Comeniusprojects. The partnerships have become very stable in the meantime. We organize the projects and keep in touch mostly by e-mail. During the last years we have got the possibility to hold conversations face to face a few times. During these meetings it was possible to discuss all the problems and fix up the strategies for the future.On the basis of these internships the students should learn to cope with the problems that arise from living abroad and can realize the chances of going abroad. The employees of the different companies are forced to use English for communication.  Most of them need not  speak English at work or at home. During the internships the students have to communicate in English. So they will lose the inhibition of speaking English and get in contact with foreign people.The first days abroad the students will be integrated into the everyday life at school. So they should become acquainted to schools abroad. After that first phase they will work for 3 to 4 weeks at different companies. During their interships the students should frequently report about their expierences and jobs. At the end of the interships the students will write summaries and will be able to have presentations at school and for the local press.In the future the HTL Hallein will try to organize longer stays abroad for our students. They should attend schools abroad for minimum of 6 months. But untill now we have not built up the basic conditions. Also, students have a lot of concerns about going abroad for a longer period of time. We therefore have to built up an organisation and have to make much more of experiences to send students abroad.", "http://www.untha.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016574_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "YO51"}
