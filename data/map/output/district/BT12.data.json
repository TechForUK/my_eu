As part of our school development planning for 2012-15 we identified as high priorities pupil language and literacy levels, teaching practices and methodologies in the classroom and the development of staff capacity in these areas.  \r\n\r\nLanguage acquisition and the development of literacy skills occur in every subject on the curriculum of Col\u00e1iste Feirste.  Each subject area has an action plan to integrate language learning with content learning.  This happens naturally in the context of immersion education but it is the experience of Col\u00e1iste Feirste that it also must be planned for specifically in each subject through a variety of learning strategies and opportunities.  As Col\u00e1iste Feirste is the only stand-alone post-primary school teaching through full IM immersion in the north of Ireland, there is a lack of understanding and expertise in this area and much of the staff capacity and teaching methods have been developed without external support.  We have recently formed a relationship with the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) in the south of Ireland in relation to language planning through content in subject areas. We intend to organise further workshops and planning days with PDST on this issue.  In addition St Mary\u2019s University College, a local third level institution, have developed a Masters course in Irish-medium immersion education for teachers in post-primary IM.

We will then monitor, evaluate and review the impact of the plan on pupils\u2019 learning and language development.

We believe that the Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) will be an important element in our overall development plan for effective language learning through the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nAs part of our school development plan, and as a result of the lack of experience, expertise and understanding of Irish-medium immersion education at post-primary level at a regional level, we would like to access such experience and expertise of language learning in immersion and bilingual contexts at a European level.  We believe that the first step in this plan is for 4 teachers to attend the Playing CLIL training course from 26th October to 1st November 2014 in Gran Canaria.  We intend that these teachers will enhance their understanding of how CLIL works, network with and learn from other teachers working in bilingual contexts and develop resources and activities to be used in Col\u00e1iste Feirste.\r\n\r\nImpact\r\nThe competences and experiences acquired by these teachers will be integrated into our overall school development plan for developing pupils\u2019 language and literacy skills in Irish through teaching the subject content in the full curriculum.

The IFA has almost 1,000 adult teams, 900 boys\u2019 teams, 300 school teams and 50 women\u2019s teams.\r\n\r\nThe application sought funding for a total of 61 participants drawn from four categories of VET staff:\r\n\r\n1.\tCommunity and grassroots coaches employed by local football clubs, local councils and schools within the region to deliver vocationally relevant training to young players;\r\n2.\tCoaches involved in Women\u2019s football;\r\n3.\tCoaches involved in futsal development in Northern Ireland;\r\n4.\tClub coaches involved in study towards the UEFA \u2018Pro\u2019 or \u2018A\u2019 Licence within the Irish FA coaching department.\r\n\r\nThe Irish FA has firmly embedded European mobility at the centre of its coach education programmes and views dissemination of the outcomes, processes and competences derived from this involvement as critical to sustaining the improvement in standards throughout Northern Ireland.\r\nThe specific objectives are summarised below:\r\n\r\n1.\tTo provide participants with access to a European centre of excellence and to allow them to acquire the skills involved in the theory, practice and delivery of the most advanced coaching technologies available in the world.\r\n2.\tTo reduce unemployment rates and enhance employability of participants through the acquisition of additional skills and qualifications as a direct result of undertaking European mobility.\r\n3.\tTo improve career progression for mobility participants as a direct result of the innovative skills and competences acquired during the mobility.\r\n4.\tTo monitor employment rates among mobility participants and compare the data with statistics obtained from coaching personnel, who have not participated in European mobility, for a period of 3 years after completion of the project mobility.\r\n5.\tTo improve the skills and knowledge base of coaches in Women\u2019s and Girls\u2019 football and increase participation to levels comparable with European countries.\r\n6.\tTo gain an understanding of the infrastructure required to organize and deliver a major UEFA European Women\u2019s competition.\r\n7.\tTo use Portuguese coaching competences and practices to enhance the participation of young people in futsal in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe relevance of this project to improving the employability of participants is validated by employer surveys which conclusively indicate that candidates with European coaching experience are much more likely to be short-listed for interview or offered employment, indicating that these skills are in demand in the UK labour market. One of the key aspirations of this project was to use the mobility work placements to bring together ideas and innovation, to identify and develop elite players and improve talent development within Northern Ireland through a clear and identifiable route through the schools, community and grassroots coaching frameworks.\r\n\r\nWork programmes for women\u2019s football coaches will place a strong emphasis on studying how young talented players are identified at the earliest opportunity and how that talent is supported and sustained through the community and grassroots infrastructure in the European partner country. These studies will be crucial to the employability of the participant coaches but will also be pivotal in increasing participation rates in women\u2019s football in Northern Ireland. The mobility outcomes will have a significant impact on the restructuring of the Irish FA regional talent identification programmes in women\u2019s football. As such, mobility will have a major impact in these sectors on a local, regional and national basis.", "http://www.irishfa.com", "IRISH FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION LTD", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012901_coordinator"], ["6LW", "Enhancing NI football skills via EU co-operation", "Linfield Football Club Limited", 32467.0, "The mobility will be effectively planned, organised, monitored and evaluated by the mobility management team to ensure that the key learning outcomes as detailed in the application have been achieved.

In addition all feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobilities undertaken. \r\n\r\nThe programme will be targeted at benefiting participants who are disadvantaged in the labour market which by virtue of the competitiveness of professional football the learners inevitably are.

Mobility will focus on the following key themes:1) To educate coaches in the activities of football clubs and other sporting organisations within Portugal and Spain.2) To encourage research in coaching methods in men\u2019s and women\u2019s football which incorporates a European perspective addressing issues of player development, gender equality, coach CPD and aspects of community development. 3) To share best practice on sport and to create concrete development support models in Northern Ireland that foster better implementation of European best practice at all levels of the game.The specific objectives relate to the professional development of the participants, increased employability and improved job security. These include but are not restricted to the following:1. To allow VET coaches to acquire the skills involved in the theory and delivery of the most advanced European coaching processes.2. To enhance the employability of participants through the acquisition of additional skills and qualifications.3. To enhance security of tenure and improve career progression for participants.4. To monitor employment rates among participants and compare the data with coaching personnel who have not participated in European mobility.5. To improve the skills of coaches in the female game and increase participation in women\u2019s football in Northern Ireland and to enhance employment prospects of coaches employed in women\u2019s football.The receiving partners in Portugal and Spain, have all been selected on the basis of them being internationally recognised Centres of Excellence in their own particular area of expertise.

The innovative coaching skills and competences derived from the mobility experience will become apparent on the professional and personal levels where they will see that planned methodical research must replace chance development in their teaching as they strive to help build world class coaching programmes and elite player development pathways.

In each of these cities, the Consortium has the support of a set of intermediaries and host companies that consolidate the quality of the project partners, with which they are collaborating for years.At a cultural and social level, apprenticeships offer young people of Cuenca the opportunity to live an enriching experience that will take place in a cultural context characterized by diversity, with new forms of work and resolving conflicts, which contribute to having a broader vision and social skills increasingly valued by companies.In short, \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d is the result of the commitment of the Consortium and its partners in continuing the promotion of training and employment for local young people.

Spain \u2013 12 places \u2013 Elite Performance coaches).\r\n\r\nThe VET Learners will be gifted Club NI players who have demonstrated potential to develop to the required level to become professional footballers. All of the VET Learners are currently undertaking a schools-based vocational education programme which involves a foundation apprenticeship framework which includes 1st4Sport Level 1 coaching award, Irish FA coaching Level 1 certificate, refereeing, laws of the game and first aid modules. \r\n\r\nOn graduation from the foundation apprenticeship programme in Club NI our aspiring young professional players are required to seek a full-time Apprenticeship Contract, usually in England or Scotland. The impact of moving away from home at a young age is significant as they struggle to meet the demands of being away from home. A staggering 90% of young players who are offered professional contracts with clubs in England dropout and return home within 2 years, as a result of being ill-prepared for the demands of playing at this level. Mobility will address this issue by improving skill sets and making them better equipped to deal with being away from home and adapting to a different working environment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of VET Staff, mobility will directly address the skills gap that has developed between coaching professionals in the UK and mainland Europe. The relative ignorance of European innovations in player development pathways has had a negative impact on the success of coaching delivery at community and grassroots level. \r\n\r\nVET Staff will study the innovations at acknowledged (UEFA) Centres of Excellence in Spain or Portugal, which are applauded as having a world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Advances in coaching delivery and tactical analysis will be used to improve the teaching skills of the mobility participants. \r\n\r\nMobility learning outcomes for VET learners will prioritise technical and tactical competences including football skills, soft skills and life skills. \r\n\r\nMobility outcomes will result in players achieving a greater degree of maturity, confidence and independence which will dramatically reduce the dropout rate among those elite Club NI players who are offered professional contracts with clubs in England and Scotland. The immersion of young (15-16 year old) VET Learners from Northern Ireland in the Spanish football programme for a two week period will provide them with the skills and competences to progress to a full-time professional playing career and enhance their prospects of achieving full international status.\r\n\r\nFor VET staff, the specific objectives relate to their professional development through increased employability, reduced risk of subsequent unemployment, and improved job security.\r\n\r\nThis mobility project will lead to a new way of strategic thinking for the participating mobility coaches on their return to Northern Ireland, irrespective of whether they operate at the elite performance, community or grassroots level of the game. It is this area between schools, the grassroots/community coaching framework and the professional clubs where the real benefits of European innovation will be applied by the returning mobility participants to maximum effect. This project will add real value by increasing, on a national basis,  knowledge, skills and competences among VET professionals as a direct result of their participation in European mobility.  \r\n\r\nThis project will enhance talent development in Northern Ireland in men\u2019s and women\u2019s football, and allow the large numbers of young people, male and female, to achieve their maximum potential as a player, irrespective of the level that they participate.

The removal of border control in the Schengen area is its most visible expression. Although important steps have been made, the vision of \u201cborderless EU\u201d is far from accomplished. The deterring economic situation in the EU gave new impulse to nationalistic and Eurosceptic movements in EU member states and candidate countries. Soon after the crisis started, media and politicians, by default, mostly found the culprit over the border or among members of minority groups.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic shift in attitude towards \u201cothers\u201d can\u2019t be explained if borders are perceived as lines on maps separating nation states. Borders are \u2013 first and foremost \u2013 a complex and dynamic mental phenomenon, (re)produced through creation of binary distinctions between the \u201cI\u201d/\u201cWe\u201d and the \u201eOther(s)\u201c/\u201cThem\u201d. People constantly draw (mental) borders between themselves and others in accordance with their individual experience, perception, memory, belief, by taking into account the collective ones they identify with \u2013 and thus practice inclusion or exclusion.\r\n\r\nBE-SMaRT is on the ball regarding the fact that understanding mental borders needs a transdisciplinary approach of different aspects of borders and thus to comprehend their impact on (young) peoples\u2019 life-experiences and constructions of identities within ever more globalized societies. Therefore bottom-up reflective educational approaches in the professional development of teachers and teacher students will be developed to challenge memories and \u201ctraditional\u201d conceptions of \u201cEurope\u201d's borders. The major innovative issue of BE-SMaRT is not just to bring together the concept of \u201cborders\u201d with individual/collective memory but to do this within teacher education and thus to act in an pedagocical context. The project\u2019s target groups (teacher, teacher students, education providers,\u2026) show this particular educational potential. In this way, BE-SMaRT is complementary to other initiatives dealing with borders, border perceptions and/or memories, which are not targeting \u201eeducational multipliers\u201c.\r\n\r\nThe project approach is multidisciplinary but anchored in Teacher Education and includes teacher students and teachers in service (as focus groups), curricula and textbooks (as political references and basis media for schools), the collection of border related life-stories/memories (as working material for teachers and teacher students) will be included in and form the basis of analysis.\r\n\r\nBE-SMaRT is designed in two progressive steps:\r\n\r\na) Analysis of studies and publications on existing and empirical knowledge of border perception through memory: Quantitative and qualitative research methods will be employed for the collection of data and for the establishment of a scientific basis in order to have relevant information and sound didactic foundation for the development of the module. The project research will focus on the representations of \u201cborders\u201d in different fields that ultimately will lead to an evaluation of existing, and the development of new approaches regarding the understanding of, and in turn, education on \u201cborders\u201d which may challenge more traditional, mainly spatial conceptions.\r\n\r\nb) Based on these diverse studies, an under-graduate and/or post-graduate module for initial teacher education degree programmes will be developed. The module aims at opening teacher education from its traditionally national orientation to a European dimension. It will become integrated into the existing university programmes and also may be used as a course for Erasmus incoming teacher education students. Blended learning components will enable communication between teacher students of the partner universities.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the module will be based on critical reflection of individuals and groups in relation to their current situation. Within BE-SMaRT, this involves questioning existing assumptions, values, and perspectives which underlie young people\u2019s actions, decisions and judgements \u2013 in the present case referring to border and memory \u2013 in order to liberate them from their habitual ways of thinking and acting. This transformation of perspectives is only possible through the critical reconsideration of one\u2019s own perspectives and orientations to perceiving, knowing, feeling, and acting \u2013 this means: what has been learned before \u2013 the frame of reference \u2013 has to be unlearned to make room for new knowledge, skills, and attitudes: it has to be re-constructed. \r\n\r\nThis approach seems most appropriate at a time when young people know the EU\u2019s political borders and perceive borderfree life within Europe as set. BE-SMaRT is about opportunities for young, dynamic EU citizens (= teachers of tomorrow) to experience meaningful dialogue about othering, to encourage them to see mutual understanding as basis from which to shape and build a more socially just, inclusive and successfully functioning European society.", "http://www.smucb.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA200-001602_5"], ["6FE", "STEM Teacher Training Innovation for Gender balance", "St Mary's University College", 276714.0, "Despite nearly 30 years of efforts to engage girls in physical sciences and engineering, the gender gap continues in the scientific vocations.

The 2 years\u2019 project we propose to develop an innovative methodology able to empower high quality and accessible ECEC services. It also fosters the assessment of transversal skills, in a Life Skills perspective, in the 0-5 children school system.  We\u2019d like to build a model of sustainable and transferable intervention on metacognitive approaches in early age learning processes. The key objective is to innovate curricula by strengthening the system of pre-school teaching/learning with the implementation of a training plan addressed to the school staff. The other key objective is the creation of meta-cognitive intervention model (MEET APP and Guidelines) aimed to strength skills for lifelong learning in early childhood. The project would like to create an effective and operational tool to implement educational policies at local, national and European level. The multiplier event and dissemination activities will be strategic in order to communicate and inform the effective impact that the project could arise. During the transnational meeting, partner will exchange point of views and will define the content of the intellectual outputs.  MEET Guidelines (01 output) will be a tool for training and it will contain Context Rationale, Target group analysis, Model contents and methodologies, shared integration/interaction approach in the Disability for ability rationale, Model teaching and learning processes and Training Modules addressed to professionals. MEET APP (02 output) is a free download APP, with an easy and comfortable approach to be used by each self. The tool will be addressed to the LIM (digital whiteboard), already existing at schools, and to the MOBILE devices at home, in order to reach also families and parents (on Smartphones and tablets- Play Store and ITunes compatible) interested in using the methodology, materials and plays.  MEET is based on the concept of Disabilities for Ability where experiences and good practices enhance skills and competences in contexts of disability and special educational needs, for an inclusive and interactive integration. It strengths the pedagogical contexts of teaching/learning; and it enhances skills for lifelong learning minimizing the potential risk factor for dysfunctional in the school experience with a focus on SEN (Special Educational Needs) and disabilities. This proposal wants to develop an innovative model adopting a holistic approach for teaching in early age (0-5). It has a children approach focused on life skills, promoting their expression and fostering their own approaches to learning and working. This approach helps children to be prepared for the next learning and schools stages, and it can be a preventive approach for their future growth. MEET provides children with the best start for the world of tomorrow, as ECEC policy recommends, thinking about competences beyond schools. The project, through a pilot action, at the end and after the project end (ensured by the protocol signed), involves 3 schools/early childhood centres, 60 teachers/professionals in ECEC, 90 families and 90 children. The project is based on the recent EU reflections about ECEC systems, whose relevance and priority is emphasized by the EU documents and national local policies, but also reflects the suggestions of National Ministries regarding the construction of stronger ECEC school curricula in partner Countries. The most recent and significant European contribution is the final speech of the EU Council on Education, Youth, Culture and Sport (Brussels,19-20/05/2011) and the discourse of the EU Presidency during the Conference on Excellence and Equity in ECEC (Budapest, 21-22/02/2011), underlined the need of a school to offer a strong starter education and to boost skills for job and well being. Additionally, constitutional charters of the partner Countries as well as the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, express the importance of education and the role of the school as a place where it must raise social equality, equal opportunities, removal of economic and social obstacles promoting the equality of citizens and the ability to become an active participant in personal growth as well as of the own country.The consortium, involving 4 partners in 4 EU countries, is representative of a wide spectrum of Countries and of skills thanks to the involvement of important and articulated professional profiles.

It aims to equip young people with skills and attitudes necessary to build up their entrepreneurial mindset and gives a kick to their own entrepreneurial projects. Young people with fewer opportunities are a target group of this project. Being especially prone to the high risk of unemployment and often having limited access to the learning programmes they need to be put more in focus and get the appropriate learning tools to boost their creativity, self-initiative, self-confidence and system thinking, as well as gain basic employability skills and knowledge. The \u201cBuild your future\u201d programme is designed to empower young people with fewer opportunities to take an active life position and be better prepared for the employment, self-employment or for further education. At the same time, it seeks to foster local entrepreneurship in the urban and rural communities in Europe through cooperation of strategic partners from multiple sectors. \r\n\r\nThe programme has two strands: 1) practice-oriented entrepreneurship course for young people with fewer opportunities, 2) strategies for fostering entrepreneurship at the local level. The programme will start with the research of the local context and young people and employers\u2019 needs and market possibilities where municipalities, local businesses and young people will be involved. The first strand will be developed in a consortium of partners (scientists, youth workers, local experts, NGOs and young people) and will foresee blended learning activities for young people, both at local and transnational level, as well as training of trainers for youth coaches and youth workers interested to deliver the course in the YEPP Local Sites. The second strand will involve municipalities and local actors in the youth and youth policy field to develop strategies for fostering local youth entrepreneurship in their communities. Part of the outputs of the programme will be the Entrepreneurship Labs \u2013 spaces to promote exchange and learning between municipalities, entrepreneurs, youth coaches and young people. Apart from this, there will be a set of local strategies for promoting entrepreneurship, as well as the overall evaluation report outlining experiences and lessons learnt from trainers and young people who participated in the course.

The majority of young people with severe mental health disorders have experienced significant educational interruptions due to their illness. The onset of most psychiatric difficulties occurs between the ages of 12 and 24 (Kessler et al. 2005; Patel et al. 2007). This is a time when many young people are completing their education, making early career choices and establishing relationships (Patel et al. 2007). \r\n\r\nAs teachers working with students who have severe mental health difficulties, we see firsthand the lack of educational supports available for our students. Many have been out of school for up to two years and feel they are unable to reintegrate. Linn Dara School in Dublin, Belfast Hospital School and Lycee Pierre Daguet, France, all face the same challenges while trying to address the educational needs of our students. \r\n\r\nLinn Dara School will coordinate and manage the project. Linn Dara School provides education to young people admitted to the Linn Dara Inpatient Unit and the Linn Dara Adolescent Day Programme in Dublin. Teachers work as members of the multidisciplinary teams. In late 2015, there will be 32 inpatient beds across three units and 18 day patient spaces in two further units which will be over 40% of national provision. \r\n\r\nBelfast Hospital School established a pilot project at the Westcourt Centre for young people with school based anxiety and mental health difficulties (TOPS Project). There have 26 young people on their roll. The purpose is to reintegrate young people back to school or further education. They work continuously with Specialist CAMHS teams of each enrolled student.\r\n\r\nLyc\u00e9e Pierre Daguet in France has 105 students. Teachers work as part of a multidisciplinary team with mental health professionals. Students have severe mental health disorders and are aged between 15 and 22 years. The goal of the school is to maintain academic identity throughout the treatment of the mental illness. Helping them finding back a place in society and regaining confidence is their priority. \r\n\r\nAll of our students require and deserve a specialised education programme to allow them to return to education while addressing their educational and medical needs. This does not exist for our students currently but it does exist internationally. Australia and New Zealand have specifically designed educational programmes for students who have severe mental health difficulties. While visiting and observing these already established programmes within the field of mental health education, each partner will work collaboratively to develop an individual educational programme suitable to meet the needs of our students which cannot be met in a mainstream setting. \r\n\r\nWe will involve members of multidisciplinary teams, medical staff and other education staff in researching, exploring and examining the programmes already in place internationally. We will collaborate with this group as well as our students, parents, local schools and policy makers in shaping and devising our programmes.\r\n\r\nThis results of this project will be disseminated through an international conference entitled 'The Educational Needs of Young People with Severe Mental Health Difficulties' where we will bring together key international stake holders in the field of education to discuss the issues surrounding the education of young people with severe mental health difficulties as well as the education programmes which have been developed by each of the partner.

The nature of the project from the outset is to provide our pupils with something different that is based on the STEAM subjects' curriculum but goes further than the traditional school curriculum. The Drones/robotics Club is a new venture for the Romanian school and for the boys of the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. Both schools will be relying on this ERASMUS plus partnership for guidance, expertise and coaching of the pupils enthusiasm in this area. Crucially this extra- curricular activity fosters the very problem-solving skills that are required in industry, both locally and globally. The Club is a very practical way of remedying the need to prepare our students earlier and better for employment in the STEAM/ MINT based industries of Engineering and ICT. This is not only relevant to St Dominic\u2019s, the all-girls school, who are committed to promoting such university courses and jobs among girls. It is the common desire to all four schools to make students  better understand environmental issues like damage and subsequently use modern drones technology to monitor the scientific observations and arrive at solutions. Phase Two of the project focuses on the exchange of drones creations and creative ideas. It goes without saying that the modern era is a global era, where one\u2019s success lies in the ability to adapt to, understand and empathize with another culture.

Furthermore, the Northern Ireland schools are coming from two very different religious, political and gender based  divisions. Ultimately, all the participants hope that it will be possible to shape European citizens that will in turn use their skills to better serve their future place of employment, society and country. The final summit-style conference in Munich in year three will allow  students to put their newly-acquired international diplomacy skills to the test, when the findings about environmental damages will be presented and the attempts at solutions will be discussed by  a panel of young scientifically fit Europeans from Romania, Northern Ireland (Great Britain) and Germany.\r\nA project of this scale cannot happen without the genuine commitment of the staff involved.
