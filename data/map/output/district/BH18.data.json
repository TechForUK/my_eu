We are keen to spread an ethos of internationalism and cultural understanding amongst our staff, students and community. We believe that the development of language skills and the unique cultural experience that a project with Erasmus + would provide are crucial to the improvement of the internationalism of our school and give us Added European Value. \r\nWe are also very keen to develop the authenticity of learning languages from a young age by working collaboratively with teachers of KS2 French at our feeder schools. This continuity will deepen students appreciation of languages and nurture them on a path towards a more culturally and linguistically diverse future.\r\nObjectives\r\nWe are very passionate about improving the profile of languages and Europe in our area and in making our approach to language learning more innovative and inspiring. At a time when language skills are in demand amongst employers, and the new curriculums at all key stages are changing to encourage more authentic language learning this is the perfect time for such a project. \r\nNumber and profile of applicants\r\nIt is very exciting to be able to work corroboratively with our feeder schools on this project as we can really start to make a difference by impacting students at a younger age. If they are being exposed to authentic and meaningful language and culture from KS2 it gives us a greater chance of nurturing them into ambitious and diverse students who want to widen their perspectives. \r\nWithin the MFL faculty the language skills learnt will be crucial to the effective delivery of the subjects and a rejuvenation of the department.\r\nIt is also very exciting to have a Science and English teacher on board who are desperate to embrace CLIL teaching and impact their own classroom through greater knowledge and awareness of the cultural and linguistic diversity of our closest neighbours.\r\nActivities \r\nThe mobilities will enable teachers to develop their language and pedagogy skills by attending courses in the target language. They will also immerse themselves in the culture, taking photos and videos which can be used back in the UK. They will search out resources as well as discuss educational and cultural issues with the host family or friends they make. They will take on board what it is to be a language learner and reflect on their own roles in equipping students with the skills they need to be successful members of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn terms of results we anticipate the skills learnt by the staff on the mobilities being transferred to the students directly through teaching and indirectly through training of the other members of the departments. \r\nNon MFL teachers will embrace CLIL teaching and feedback to others in their departments, who may then do their own mobilities in the future.\r\nOn a wider scale, the experience of going to another country and learning the language in such an intense way can be shared with students and teachers alike with a view to opening their eyes to the possibilities out there. Skills and pedagogy  as well as practical information can be disseminated to staff via training, and motivational talks can be given to students via assemblies. The impact will be widespread and further publicized via the website and newsletter. The middle schools envisage 'before and after' assemblies.\r\nA special 'language day' where teachers all teach a part of their lesson in another language will bring the whole experience to the forefront of the school and encourage an atmosphere of collaboration and respect. Middle Schools will be encouraged to attend and get ideas to do similar projects in their own schools. This kind of innovation in languages will really help increase the reputation of languages and our role in Europe.\r\nIn the longer term we hope to start a TEFL course at Sixth Form and either language or culture lessons can take place as preparation for students opting for this qualification. \r\nThe longer term benefits of such a project would be a more internationally minded staff and student body at the school who are keen to get involved with other international projects / exchanges etc. Languages will have more of an appeal and therefore numbers of language students could rise. \r\nWe are very keen as a school to view these mobilities as part of a longer-term plan whereby subsequent training and bi-component courses takes place. Teachers could perhaps return to the country and gain more of an insight into the education system and practices which again can be disseminated amongst Corfe Hills School.", "http://www.corfehills.net", "Corfe Hills School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013160_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH18"}
