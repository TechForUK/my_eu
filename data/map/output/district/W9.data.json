Possible requirements for participating in the project are e.g. intermediate-level educational qualification including one year at a vocational school or general qualification for university entrance including a 6-week social work placement.The project is run based on the institute's training responsibility. This means that priority is given to the curriculum as well as competence orientation during training.

The stay abroad allows the participants to learn about the basic European conception of diversity and the resulting challenges of various cooperation levels, such as solidarity.The project implementation process is divided into 3 phases:The mobility project begins with the preparation phase, which includes learning more about the respective placement country, attending a project-related language course in small groups and elaborating the project topic together in one large group.The second phase of the project takes place abroad. During this phase the participants are actively involved in the educational work of the partner institution.

We feel that our lack of knowledge in this area is contributing to the frustrations of students, educators and parents alike. We are giving great value to this project because we believe that our approach in teaching and communicating with students with Autism, is beneficial for all students with disabilities especially those students who present challenging behaviour secondary to Attention Deficit and Severe Learning Disabilities. We also believe that by training a core of the staff working in this area, we will be reaching all the other teaching staff in Gozo whom we collaborate with in this field. We also give great value to observation sessions that the staff will be having in schools which fall within the National Autistic Society and have rated been rated by Ofsted as \u2018Outstanding\u2019.Currently, the Maltese government is very keen to give more opportunities to allow persons with disabilities to develop their full potential .
