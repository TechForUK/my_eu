Mandarin and French are taught as a continuation of the languages taught in primary schools thanks to the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 policy for languages. Spanish has been added recently to respond to pupils and parents' interests.\r\nIn order to continue to provide quality learning and teaching, the school will send two of their languages teachers on training courses so they can enhance their methodological expertise of the learning and teaching of French and Spanish respectively. Both participants are qualified language teachers that are developing their knowledge in the teaching of a second foreign language. By going on these courses, they will acquire new techniques to improve their professional practice.\r\nThe courses will be focused on communication and culture. They will provide teachers with the opportunity to improve their language competency with daily classes. Cultural outings will also be organised to broaden their cultural awareness of contemporary French and Spanish societies. \r\nMoreover, teachers will gain new ideas for resources and authentic materials like songs, media and ICT. They will also share good practice with other participants and become part of a European network of schools, which will promote international cooperation in their school when they return.\r\nOn their return, participants will make use of the resources they have gained to provide innovative and efficient learning and teaching in their classroom, which will contribute to reinforce the Scottish Curriculum for Excellence. They will also share resources and ideas with colleagues in the school and in network meetings. International cooperation projects will be created using eTwinning to give pupils the opportunity to exchange with their peers in other European countries. The project will contribute to improve the uptake in languages in the senior phase with more languages on offer in the school following this project.\r\nAttending these courses will benefit the participating teachers who will acquire and develop new language and teaching skills. It will also benefit their pupils who will experience innovative and engaging learning and teaching in Modern Foreign Languages.", null, "OLDMACHAR ACADEMY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047293_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB22"}
