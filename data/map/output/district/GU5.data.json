Two French language teachers will attend the course and will participate in all teaching sessions and cultural and educational visits.  There will be good opportunities to network and exchange teaching ideas with the other European teachers attending the course and the French teachers at the school.  At the end of the week, the teachers will produce some teaching materials for presentation.  After the course, the teachers will continue to exchange ideas with the other teachers through a blog.   As a result of the attendance of the week\u2019s course, the school and its pupils will benefit from a more innovative language curriculum through the introduction of the creative teaching methods learnt on the course and there will be opportunities to develop European projects through the links made on the course.", "http://www.stcatherines.info", "St Catherine's School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012747_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU5"}
