This is visible in the age structure of the population and is reflected by the fact that the population aged 65 years and over is increasing in every European country. The growth in the elderly population may be explained by increased longevity, but at the same time, we also see an increase in debilitating conditions. However, it is also clear that the elderly are afflicted by challenging health conditions as a direct consequence of being elderly which impact their quality of life (QOL), e.g. living alone, depression, recovery from illness, immobility. This is what we would like to address. Living longer should be a privilege but there has been a collective failure to address social implications and QOL issues, where social care and the way it is funded are already in crisis. Our aim in this project is to couple the need for new societal approaches in addressing this changing demographic with improving the economy of green microenvironment sites, where health tourism and creating new jobs in this sector would in turn fund and provide benefits with respect to the well-being of the elderly. The ultimate outcome, through this pan-European academic and industrial project, will be: a) to derive cross-disciplinary and inter-sectorial knowledge of how to improve physical and mental well-being in the elderly, b) to characterise the environmental geology of Nemi and to correlate the identified features with improvements in health, well-being and recovery, c) to train a new generation of specialists in the sector of recreation and health for the tourism industry, d) the training of specialists in social and therapeutic horticulture (STH) as a way to improve physical and mental health, e) to create a model for health tourism, and f) to produce a business plan with an economic impact analysis.", 94210.0, 2119728.0, "CHARMED", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207458_919847024"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1LE", "Youth Opportunities", "Sutton Coldfield YMCA", 15363.0, "Sutton Coldfield YMCA has a sucessful history of international youth work.

Young people with economic, social, educational and geographical difficulties may converge towards a downward spiral that could prevent them from having real possibilities of access to the European labor market. Youth organizations who work daily with young people with fewer opportunities are a real possibility for them, the gateway to a future inclusion. The partnership created for this project strongly believes in this challenge, aware that non-formal education methods represent an essential tool in the fight against social exclusion, and promoting youth participation and initiative. We therefore believe that we must act internationally to workers and youth organizations can provide resources, tools, methodologies, knowledge and skills, particularly digital, to promote new educational pathways in order to combat social exclusion.Our association intends to organize a seminar on the duration of six days, from 17 to 22 October 2016 in which include a total of 26 youth workers in order to acquire or upgrade skills and digital literacy in developing their activities with young people with fewer opportunities, especially those at risk of social exclusion.Specific project objectives include:- Display tools and job search strategies and the promotion of personal branding online European youth workers who perform their activities with young people with fewer opportunities.- Identify the benefits of Web 3.0 to promote youth employment and entrepreneurship, so that our professional profile more interesting, communications applications know how to contact the companies, design and brand management staff , communication, marketing, etc.- Know the basic guidelines for effective participation in these networks in order to raise awareness of career guidance for unemployed youth (complete your profile, give it a more professional appearance, set restrictions, build brand image, etc.).- Know the main resources of existing jobs in Europe and how to facilitate access to them from any European country.- Provide resources for self-employment for young people with fewer opportunities.- Improving the image of European policies related to employment, international mobility and youth through case studies and specific documentation.The methodology will be based primarily in the transmission of theoretical knowledge through audiovisual support such as PowerPoint presentations, prezi and videos, combined with practical work about the contents and tools used. We will discuss a number of online tools and do tests on them. All information is shared and stored in a google drive that teach how to use efficiently. The sessions will be open and participatory at all times, with specific dynamics and ice breaker.In particular we will work in teams with tools that facilitate us the practical application of knowledge through roll-play and group dynamics.We hope the results of the project can generate a direct impact on participants and partner organizations as well as, indirectly, in young users of the organizations and other youth associations and workers who receive information and materials produced during the activity. Digital skills acquired will improve the training routes for young people with fewer opportunities, increasing the participation and youth initiative and reducing social exclusion.The creation of a future network of partners guarantee us deeper into the issue of social exclusion working together to carry out new and innovative initiatives and replicate similar initiatives in local, national and international levels.", "http://www.suttoncoldfieldymca.org.uk/downloads.pl", null, "erasmus_2016-2-ES02-KA105-008412_15"], ["1LE", "Youth Now", "Sutton Coldfield YMCA", 15532.0, "The role of the volunteer should mainly be to offer his/her special skills connected to and co-ordinated with the program and projects of Sutton ColdfieldYMCA  and the local community.
