Glottalization ceases or modifies phonation by compressing the vocal folds. In German, an abrupt glottalized onset to phonation is frequent in front of word-initial vowels. In English this is less frequent and more likely to occur at phrase boundaries. The interplay between external-sandhi and glottalization is not clear: glottalizations are supposed to take place in absence of external sandhi, but articulatory gestures related to both phenomena can co-occur.\nI will build on my previous work on glottalizations, which showed the extent to which word boundary glottalization is transferred in language learning and actively used in perception. External sandhi, which is more common in English, can be \u201cblocked\u201d by glottalization: so English-accented German will be compared to English. Acoustic analysis will be accompanied by articulatory analysis in order to detect a possible co-occurrence of both phenomena. Perception experiments with manipulated speech will be carried out with native English and German listeners, to test the influence of glottalization and of external sandhi on word recognition and on the perception of phrase boundaries.\nThis is the first extensive investigation of the interplay between external sandhi and glottalization in relationship with prosodic boundaries by means of articulatory, acoustic and perceptual analysis.", 168179.0, 168179.0, "TRASANGLOTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.qmu.ac.uk", null, "fp7_187763_986460416"], ["6UU", "Innovative Social and Employment Policies for Inclusive and Resilient Labour Markets in Europe", "Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh", "The INSPIRES project aims to contribute to resilient and inclusive labour markets in Europe.

In order to do so, it analyzes in-depth the evolution of labour markets policies, employment policies and social policies.

This report gives an analysis and assessment of labour market resilience in 29 European countries. Objective data and regression analyses assessed national differences in responses to the financial crisis both between and within countries for the different vulnerable groups.\n\nThe report sheds light onto cross-country differences in the labour market resilience of the total population and offers insight into the different vulnerable groups in Europe. Many factors contribute to labour market resilience. These factors change over time and vary across the different vulnerable groups. Another discovery from the research is that youth and migrants were the most vulnerable groups across Europe in the aftermath of the recent crisis, both in terms of the highest increases in unemployment rates and the risk of poverty and social exclusion.\n\nNine country reports have been finalised, the final 2 are due in month\u00a020. The most important dissemination activity in the first reporting period has been the creation of the INSPIRES website and the creation of a dissemination plan.

In addition, the trainees and vocational students gain an insight into the professional life of another European country, which increases their future career opportunities.\r\nVocational mobility in Europe and intercultural experience in the service sector in connection with the training and practice of social skills due to the teambuilding of higher-performing and weaker students offers young people the opportunity to gain experience abroad. It also lays the basis for a lifelong willingness to learn in an international context. At the same time, the chance of obtaining a school degree as well as the successful participation in professional and social life should increase for all pupils participating in the project. The project strategy is thus closely linked to the fields of action agreed as part of the qualification initiative for Germany \"Advancement through Education\". The stay abroad should strengthen the responsibility for one's own learning processes and encourage professional development as well as personal development. Moreover, improvement of linguistic and communicative ability, but also of \"soft skills\" such as empathy, teamwork, leadership and dedication, will benefit the participants in their further professional career and private life.\r\nThe selection of students who are interested in the project takes place via the successful participation in a mandatory working group \"Professional English\". By means of a coordinated, individualized learning plan focusing on vocational training as well as concentration on the development of individual strengths and differentiated performance feedbacks the educational success of pupils of different talents is promoted by a teaching, which does justice to the heterogeneity of the student body. During this process, the participants get to know each other and with the help of the teacher, the tandems of higher- and lower-performing students are formed.\r\nThe project is aimed at vocational students (catering, hospitality, hairdressing, nutrition, education and health). It is designed to enhance the competences of trainees and vocational students by practising a European foreign language in a professional context and by experiencing interculturality whilst being introduced to vocational training in both countries. \r\nDue to the support offered through the tandems, lower performing apprentices or students who might not have thought about a practical experience abroad are motivated to participate in this project and learn to expand their professional and foreign language skills as well as their self-confidence. \r\nAt the same time, teachers participating in this mobility project will be trained as multipliers to bring newly acquired professional knowledge and acquired foreign language skills into our school life. This serves the intercultural exchange in the education system or the internationalization of the vocational training at the Alice-Salomon Vocational College in accordance with the European Development Plan. A long-term goal is the implementation of a professional bilingual teaching (CLIL) in all vocational subjects at the Alice-Salomon Vocational College as well as the establishment of a long-term partnership or the establishment of an exchange program with Edinburgh College for further professionalization.\r\nThis project has an impact -beyond the Alice-Salomon Vocational College- on the surrounding cities of the region. This was demonstrated by the positive response of chambers, guilds and employers in the field of hospitality and health care to whom this project was introduced. With the help of this project they hope to increase the attractiveness of the professions in the service and health care sector and gain access to qualified trainees with pronounced social and professional competences.

The partnership will engage in the intensive dissemination of those materials which will tackle skills gaps and mismatches be addressing work-based learning, embedded in real-life practical situations that will support the workplace learning of early-career and experienced professional archaeologists. It will embed international experience and transnational mobility throughout.\r\n\r\nContext / Project Background\r\nIt is difficult for archaeologists to move around Europe to work, as there are not consistent ways to record and demonstrate skills\r\nProfessional archaeology as a sector was heavily affected across Europe by the global economic changes from 2008 onwards, owing to its relationship with the construction industry\r\nThe sector now anticipates growth in many European countries, with concern about potential shortages of skilled workers\r\nThe project proposes a novel and innovative way for practitioners and aspirant practitioners to access VET that they and employers value, in order to enhance their potential to play active roles in the labour market \r\nThe project partners are from Spain, UK, Italy, Austria (German Language), Netherlands and Poland. According to labour market intelligence these countries/language groups have some of the largest European archaeological workforces and so could support increased transnationality \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe project will create freely accessible training materials to teach archaeologists technical skills to a common standard, delivered as digital materials, specifically short videos, in a modular format so each skill would be addressed in a self-contained learning experience that could either be separated out and learned individually or combined into a longer, structured learning VET experience\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nThe materials will be created by researchers, technicians and managers from six partner countries (UK, Spain, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, Poland) who are sectoral experts in both archaeological practice and in VET. Approximately 60 people will contribute to the creation of materials for the project, and several hundred more practitioners will be involved in testing the materials\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nPartners will collectively identify priority area for skills development (taking into account data gathered in previous labour market intelligence projects undertaken for the sector by some of the partners and funded in part by the European Commission through the Lifelong Learning Programme) matching these against the requirements of a shared validation tool, the Archaeological Skills Passport \r\nFrom these priority areas the partners will create sixteen focussed training videos with voice overs available in six partner languages, thus creating a total of 96 separate VET training tools (16 videos in 6 languages) allowing their use across multiple countries. These videos will then be freely available as stand-alone training materials, and will also be able to form part of more substantial, structured learning activities\r\nThe materials will be available in a portable digital format allowing access in the workplace on a mobile device such as a smartphone or laptop. The modular nature of this resource means it will be quick and easy to access training for a single skill while working on an archaeological site\r\nThe videos will then be integrated into the Heritage Education Portal, an e-learning platform developed by some of the partners under a predecessor Erasmus+ project (ANHER), and through that and by use of YouTube they will be made available and accessible\r\n\r\nResults and Impact Envisaged\r\nAudiences for this training are early career practitioners and those looking to refresh their specific, technical skills that are common to archaeological practice in most countries, encouraging up-skilling of workforces across Europe. Some materials will be country-specific, so beneficiaries will learn quickly and efficiently the required skills and techniques to begin working in a different country, encouraging a transnational workforce that can meet skill shortages across Europe\r\nThe materials can also be included in formal training and CPD programmes. Because they will be licensed under an open Creative Commons license, universities could integrate them into their teaching. Employers and professional associations could use the training materials as validated CPD for their professional grades \r\n\r\nPotential Long Term Benefits\r\nThis project proposes the development and delivery of materials that could help train up a workforce quicker than a 3-4 year degree in archaeology, in order to meet anticipated increased demand\r\nBeneficiaries will be able to use the Archaeological Skills Passport to have their skills validated and thus demonstrated to employers", "http://www.archaeologyscotland.org.uk/", "Archaeology Scotland", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA202-047943_coordinator"], ["6UU", "Development of innovative e-learning and teaching through strategic partnerships in Global Health Education", "QUEEN MARGARET UNIVERSITY, EDINBURGH", 270142.0, "The 2013 Communication on Opening Up Education identified the expansion of online delivery as a priority for education within the EU. Provision of online higher education within Europe is under-developed and this is particularly so within postgraduate global health education. \r\n\r\nThe development of high quality online education has been slow within European universities. This may be due to lack of expertise among teaching faculty, concerns about the effectiveness of technology or reluctance to invest the time required to produce learning materials. The project aims to address potential barriers through:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Promoting and developing the pedagogical and technological skills amongst HE staff to enable them to develop innovative eLearning materials\r\n\u2022 Facilitating digital literacy skills amongst students in order to enable them to reach optimal capacity as innovative learners\r\n\u2022 Establishing a framework for the future accreditation of eLearning and a handbook and guidelines for ELearning and dissertation supervision in global health education. .\r\n\r\nThe three partner organisations (in Scotland, Norway and the Netherlands) have all been involved in the delivery of postgraduate teaching in global health through engagement with the TropEd network. The partners wish to make blended and distance learning options available in order to meet the growing demand for higher education from partner countries within and outside of Europe. As many students face economic or geographical challenges such as high fees, high living costs, visa restrictions and the difficulty of being away from home for a full year blended learning and eLearning offer an obvious solution to many of these challenges.\r\n\r\nKey activities and outputs of the project will include:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Staff training in developing eMaterials, mainly through the use of long-term training assignments.\r\n\u2022 Sharing of practice between the 3 partner institutions and in the TropEd network.\r\n\u2022 Development of guidance on supervision of global health dissertations from a distance.\r\n\u2022 Development of 9 eLearning modules, clustered into 3 coherent pathways. These will give students access to a blended learning experience that combines the expertise of the three different partners and allows students to engage in virtual mobility across the 3 partner institutions. Learning materials will subsequently be made available as an open learning resource.\r\n\u2022 Delivery of the first 6 modules and evaluation thereof. 24 students (8 per institution) will be recruited for each cohort, the first in 2016-17 (pilot phase) and the second in 2017-18. Students will be registered at each partner organisation and will come to Europe to study the first semester in classroom. Students will then return to their home countries and undertake the remaining modules online. Completion of a dissertation, supervised remotely, will enable successful students to qualify for the award of European Master of Science in International Health\r\n\u2022 Agreement of accreditation guidelines for eLearning within the TropEd network. \r\n\u2022 The experience of the full three-year project will be used to develop a Handbook for eLearning that can be used by all academics working in a similar field. Two journal articles will also be produced.\r\n\r\nThe main result will be to establish a foundation on which future eLearning developments can build, both within the partner institutions and across European networks, especially TropEd. The agreement of an accreditation framework for eLearning within TropEd will open up the possibility for further virtual mobility and partnership working.  The project will contribute to the expansion of online higher education provision within the EU, enabling European universities to maintain a competitive edge in the ever-growing field currently dominated by the US.\r\n\r\nThe project will increase in digital literacy amongst teachers and learners of global health education. The three participating organisations will benefit from acquiring pedagogical and technological skills to develop innovative eLearning and teaching materials and this knowledge will be shared through the Handbook on eLearning. Creation of a critical mass of digitally literate practitioners will lead to the development of further modules and continued collaboration to develop more coherent pathways.\r\n\r\nAs a high proportion of students interested in global health education come from economically or geographically disadvantaged backgrounds, particular attention will be paid to their support needs. \r\nIt is hoped that through this project more potential students, currently working as managers or policy-makers in governmental and non-governmental organisations in Europe and beyond, will be able to access higher education that is directly relevant to their roles.", "http://www.qmu.ac.uk", "QUEEN MARGARET UNIVERSITY, EDINBURGH", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA203-013461_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH21"}
