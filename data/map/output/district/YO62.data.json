It concerns pupils aged 6-11. The project focuses on the problem of social exclusion (based on lack of basic skills). In order to reach this goal of inclusion we will practice new strategies and methods of teaching cooperatively and inclusively at schools and during leisure time activities.This application refers to the particular needs of students according to the needs analysis which took place at the all partner schools. As the group of this project we discussed and defined 4 problems which prevent school success. They include lack of social inclusion, lack of basic skills, lack of parental support and finally lack of socio-economical needs. The needs analysis had been done at five schools by teachers' observation, sharing ideas and applying basic survey which evaluated these four obstacles. As a result, in the UK the problem of lack of social inclusion and parental support does not exist, but they need to develop the level of basic skills and help students who lack socio-economical needs. Other schools have problems, more or less, with this fourth issue. At Romanian and Italian schools, \u201clack of social inclusion and basic skills \u201d of the students  seem to be the most important problems in term sof preventing students from  adapting academic success. In Turkish and Slovenian schools \u201clack of basic skills, lack of parental support and lack of socio-economic needs\u201d became the key reasons for failure. Besides,  each school has different good practices in their school curriculum (see related sections). They will be observed and followed by the teachers and transferred after evaluation. The strategies and methods which we agreed upon to apply embody plenty of ideas which stand for a real alternative to solve these four problems. Before creating this project we had a pre-work period about the new strategies and defined 5 new ones to use in our project. Every partner will apply one of these methods in its school environment, observe and evaluate the outcomes. During the meetings these outcomes will be discussed by all the partners and will be transferred to one another. At the end of 2 year time, 5 strategies will have been applied and evaluated. According to the observation and results of success the partners will continue to use these strategies and methods at their schools. OBJECTIVES-to promote the inclusion of excluded students, the ones with lack of basic skills, the risk of dropping out, with special needs by helping to promote their integration into the mainstream education and society. -to apply new strategies for overcoming social exclusion, lack of basic skills and school drop out-to conduct new methods in the field of social and emotional child development as part of students with special educational needs' practical curriculum. -to give teachers different methods of education and share the good practicesNUMBER AND PROFILE OF THE PARTICIPANTSStudents/teenagers: there will be teams of 30 students at each partner organisation so 180 in total will take part actively in the project activities.
