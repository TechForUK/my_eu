The strategy aims to create a sustainable, attractive and competitive region and give young people international competence, experience and shared responsibility. The region (approx. 500.000 inhabitants) faces challenges concerning climate and energy, sustainable development, access to a skilled and competent labour force, innovation and development in the economic sector. As school owner HCC has committed to use the schools as local resource centres for economic and local development (Regional Development programme 2013). HCC is continuously working to adapt education and training to fit the needs of the region, and to prevent early school leaving (dropouts) (Action Plan for Internationalisation in Education 2014). These objectives are to a large extent in correspondence with the EU\u2019s 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. HCC is using participation in Erasmus+ Mobility as a strategic tool to reach these objectives, in close cooperation with priority partners: Vocational education and training, private sector, local authorities and civil society. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives for the project are to strengthen the region with professional knowledge, skills and competences adapted to the needs in different sectors, develop prosperous local communities, and improve learning outcomes for pupils, increase recruitment, prevent early school leaving and raise awareness in VET schools for internationalisation \u201cat home\u201d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants: 230 VET learners/staff, 56 accompanying persons and 138 adult education staff (professionals).\r\n\r\nHCC is the coordinator for the project and has extensive experience in project cooperation and management in different EU projects e.g. the Life Long Learning and Interreg programmes, and is well qualified to carry out this project. Coordination and quality management are based on strong and long term cooperation with sending, intermediate and receiving organisations in Hordaland and Europe. This involves communication and planning activities, project development, coordination and management, and dissemination of results. HCC encourages participants to focus on further development of the cooperation achieved in the mobilities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project VET learners will have the opportunity to experience daily work practices in European companies within different subjects e.g.: Building and construction, health care, social work, technology and industrial production, restaurant/hotel/food and maritime subjects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent groups of staff will exchange experiences, and meet European colleagues through placements, work experiences, internships and meetings. For staff and subjects like:\r\n\r\n-VET teachers: Technological subjects and design & craft.\r\n\r\n-Regional and local cross-sectorial partner groups with focus on entrepreneurship and VET: Sustainable local development, innovation and need for new competences in companies, maintenance of sports complexes, transport & communication, aquaculture, local handcraft, tourism, public health and health care services in the municipalities.  \r\n\r\n-Other professionals: Sustainable energy in buildings, healthcare, local food traditions and design & crafts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the project, HCC will use the following methodology:\r\n\r\n-Writing an application on behalf of participating organisations with a focus on European, regional and local needs and priorities\r\n\r\n-Coordination and management of the mobilities\r\n\r\n-Good relations with regional partners in Europe\r\n\r\n-Assisting VET schools and municipalities with project development, and to strengthen relations with their partners in Europe\r\n\r\n-Stimulating cross-sectorial and interdisciplinary European cooperation and interaction\r\n\r\n-Strong anchorage of the mobilities in the sending organisations\r\n\r\n-Arranging meetings preparing the participants for the mobilities\r\n\r\n-Focusing on reciprocal mobilities, experiences and best practices \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\n-International competence, and new knowledge and skills to be implemented in the participating organisations and regions\r\n\r\n-Increased VET recruitment and more motivated, international focused and self-empowered pupils (prevent drop-outs)\r\n\r\n-Strengthen cooperation and cross-sectorial approach to economic and sustainable local development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project has long term effects which contribute to reach the objectives for the participating partners. The mobilities will increase motivation and ability for future project cooperation on local, regional, national and European level. The schools are expected to use their experiences as a tool to incorporate internationalisation \u201cat home\u201d. As a follow up, the reciprocal focus in the mobilities will stimulate European partnerships to actively use the Erasmus+ programme for further cooperation also in strategic partnerships, school partnerships and teacher exchanges.", "http://www.cavc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO01-KA102-000217_30"], ["8YJ", "FORMACI\u00d3N PR\u00c1CTICA PARA CONSEGUIR UNA CUALIFICACI\u00d3N PROFESIONAL Y MEJORAR LAS HABILIDADES CULTURALES Y SOCIALES EN OTRO PA\u00cdS EUROPEO (III)", "Cardiff and Vale College", 24682.0, "This new Erasmus + KA1 KA102 promoted by CIPFP La Costera from X\u00e0tiva is presented with the objective of improving the results of previous announcements.\r\nWe know that our two previous Leonardo projects have been successful , but this new Erasmus + project will let us tackle other needs that we didn't deal with in PAP, such as the personal mobility itself.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, this centre will request:\r\n\r\n1.

Furthermore, the school and the teachers have built along the years a wide network of almost 600 companies. Indeed, we have a trustworthy and long established relationship with those companies which have provided our school with many work placements for our students. Teachers in charge of the work placements are very reliable, communicative and very quick at solving problems. Moreover, they are used to work with companies and monitor students. Our teachers have the social skills needed in order to handle excellent work placements.\r\nBecause of our desire to improve in a European level, in 2012 a team work was created to carry out projects and in 2014 the Erasmus charter for Higher Education besides the first Erasmus project were obtained. As a consequence of the great success, the following year we got it again but for 24 months. In 2017 our target is to achieve it once again in order to ask for the Erasmus+ Vocational Education And Training Mobility Charter.\r\nThis projects contains two activities:\r\n1. Vocational training for one month at workplace in a European Country: the students are around 17 and 22 years old and study Vocational Education Training on commerce, administration, electromechanics, body work repairs, electronics and electricity. 40 students will be sent between 2018 and 2019. \r\n2.

Quality mobility stays give pupils and apprentices the opportunity to acquire further professional knowledge, improve language skills, and create positive attitudes. Further, the mobility stays contribute to the development of transversal skills that will be important in a in a long-term competence development perspective.

Educational provision should be in line with regional needs and restructuring to green workplaces. This year, HCC has especially targeted tertiary VET schools for participation in the project. These projects will address themes such as developing quality tertiary VET, competence requirements for Ocean Space Technology, recent approval and start-up of a study programme about local food culture at Hjeltnes, and the development of a new study programme for alternative energy in collaboration with NCE Maritime Cleantech. These staff mobilities also provide opportunities to create a European network for potential future mobilities of tertiary VET students.\r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 47 mobility projects, which count 177 pupils and 17 apprentices from 13 different secondary VET schools and 7 training offices, and 64 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 15 mobility projects, which count 134 staff from various VET institutions, companies, municipalities, industry organisations and other regional development actors. The disciplines represented in this application include health care/social work, restaurant/hotel business, industrial technology, hairdressing, electricity/electronics, landscaping, and office administration.
