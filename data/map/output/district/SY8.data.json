To be successful manufacturers must be pro-active and creative in thinking about the opportunities that the sustainable economy will present to develop new products and markets and optimize their value networks according to the new sustainability criteria.\nThe overall goal of SustainValue is to develop industrial models, solutions and performance standards for new sustainable and more performing production and service networks. The project will develop governance and business models, a new methodology to support sustainable life cycle decisions and sustainability assurance performance standards for complex business processes in integrated production and service networks. SustainValue results aim\n1) to enhance governance and business models that enable active integration of dynamic and complex production systems towards cooperative and sustainable value adding business networks, 2)\tto simplify the adoption of sustainable approaches, business models and solutions providing sustainability and performance KPIs together with guidelines of implementation,\n3)\tto deliver a new methodology that supports sustainable, competitive and customer oriented life cycle decisions on products and services in complex production systems, 4) to support compliance verification processes for continuous improvement by developing sustainability assurance performance standards for complex business processes in integrated production and service networks.", 69215.0, 3388033.0, 5, 11, "SUSTAINVALUE", null, "http://www.riversimple.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/149446.jpg", "fp7_98467_975286404"], [1349049600000, 1514678400000, "Demonstration of Small 4-Wheel fuel cell passenger vehicle Applications in Regional and Municipal transport", "Riversimple Llp", "This project will establish a demonstration fleet of small passenger vehicles that builds on and expands existing hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. Three European regions will be participating in this effort: the UK (the Midlands and Plymouth), the Brussels area and Wallonia, and the Weser-Ems region in NorthWest Germany. Each of these regions will deploy a new hydrogen refuelling site to close the gaps in a continuous \u2018hydrogen highways\u2019 that leads from Scotland via the Midlands to London, connecting to Brussels and on to Cologne and Hamburg/Scandinavia/Berlin via Bremen.\nThe vehicles employed are low-cost, high fuel-efficiency, hybridised, light-weight passenger cars specifically designed for city and regional transport. These vehicles provide a complementary pathway to commercialisation to the large Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of hydrogen fuel cell options, by allowing near-term rollout on a commercial basis to a wide range of users \u2013 in parallel with the planned rollouts for large OEM vehicles from 2015. Their deployment regions will gain the infrastructure, public exposure and technological understanding to act as seed locations for future large scale OEM vehicle rollout.\nIn view of the lower vehicle costs, this project will deploy an unprecedented number of road vehicles for a demonstration project, with three OEM\u2019s contributing 20, 10 and 20 vehicles respectively to the project. These will be put in the hands of users in a variety of real-life operating environments. An extensive data monitoring exercise will run throughout the demonstration phase, allowing the reliability of the vehicles tested by different users to be evaluated and leading to recommendations for the improvement of future, fully commercial vehicle designs.\nThe three European regions will deploy several hydrogen refuelling stations, adding a total of 3 new stations to existing supply sites, contributing to some of the first regional hydrogen refuelling clusters in Europe. Each region will as a consequence either own a high-standard filling station with = high capacity (200 kg/day) and high performance (70 MPa) refuelling technology (Wallonia, Weser-Ems), or build on existing smaller stations of lower capacity and pressure (UK, Midlands and Plymouth).\nThe project will be a near-commercial stepping stone and will include a reach-out activity timed to coincide with OEM\u2019s commercialisation plans in the post-2015 period, to attract further vehicles to the newly developed infrastructures - by offering cost effective and readily available focal points for additional hydrogen fleets developing around these regions.
