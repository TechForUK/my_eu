Products such as garlic, ginger, spring onions and shrimps are cellular tissues containing gas-filled pores that tend to collapse when subjected to dehydration. This collapse is more noticeable with prolonged exposure to elevated drying temperatures, such as those used in convective drying. For this reason, hot air drying results in substantial degradation in quality attributes such as colour, nutrients and flavour, sever shrinkage also reduces bulk density and dehydration capacity. Also, chemical changes causing loss of flavour and nutrients occur during convective drying so the properties of dehydrated products are poor. A number of drying techniques have been developed over the years, among them atmospheric forced-air dehydration, a very common method. The major disadvantage of the hot air convective drying of food is the low energy efficiency and lengthy drying time during the falling rate period.\n\nMILD-DRY will build on the positive results of laboratory trails using microwave-assisted vacuum drying (MAVD) for the successful dehydration of selected foods, whereby the drying time for carrots for example was reduced to 2 h compared with 4.5-8.5 h in convectional hot air drying. Moreover, dried carrots showed higher rehydration potential, higher beta-carotene and vitamin C contents, lower density, and softer texture than those prepared by air drying. Further research effort will be performed in order to optimise the approach through the intermittent as opposed to continuous application of MW in order to achieve higher energy savings and product quality enhancement.

It is critical that effective decontamination steps are in place to ensure consumer protection and confidence in fresh produce. There is thus a requirement to ensure microbiological safety during production of minimally processed fresh foods in order to reduce contaminants and control cross contamination events to maintain microbiological quality and safety. There is a clear need to provide fresh cut fruit and vegetables packers with an affordable, safe and effective method of offering microbiological safety assurance, while at the same time increasing shelf life and retention of nutritional quality.\n\nThis project aims to develop a novel continuous in-pack decontamination system for fresh produce, by building on the results of past research that has been carried out by the Dublin Institute of Technology, whereby plasma technology has been effectively used for the in-pack decontamination of food products at laboratory scale. Plasma is widely used for industrial materials processing, and has recently shown promise as a decontamination tool, by injuring and inactivating pathogenic bacteria on inert food contact surfaces. A prototype in-pack decontamination system will be designed and built during the project, and its effectiveness for decontaminating fresh bagged lettuce, fruits and vegetables will be validated in industry.  The system allows for short half-life radicals, such as singlet oxygen, to be generated within a sealed bag leading to microorganism inactivation, after which the confined gas returns to its original composition.

Mycotoxins enter the food chain via infected crops that are either directly consumed by humans or indirectly ingested as a consequence of crops as an animal feed ingredient. These toxins have been linked to human oesophageal cancer, equine leukoencephalomalacia, and toxic feed syndrome in poultry, and pulmonary edema in pigs. In recent years, research on cumulative risks, exposure, and long-term effects has raised awareness for the control of such health risks. Due to the potential danger of such carcinogens to humans and livestock, strict regulatory controls determine the sale and use of mycotoxin-containing foods. Resulting, grain and other foodstuff buyers increasingly demand more rigorous and timely food safety testing. Failure to achieve a satisfactory performance may lead to unacceptable consignments being accepted or satisfactory batches being unnecessarily rejected. However, quantitative and rapid analysis of these toxins is difficult with analytical results prone to vary between laboratories, sometimes by orders of magnitude.\nThe MYCOSPEC project will develop an innovative tool based on infrared spectroscopic fingerprinting techniques for the rapid on-site diagnosis of fungal diseases at the surface of foods or in liquid foodstuffs such as e.g., homogenized foodstuff or beverages. The envisaged approach will enable the development of a compact yet highly sensitive tool, which will ensure that larger volumes of the cereals and foodstuffs can be probed, sensitively detected, and quantified.

Dried food offers many advantages for the mass production of commercially prepared goods, not least cheaper transportation costs, longer storage life and ease of use. However modern drying methods, such as Accelerated Freeze-Drying, prove costly, time consuming, labour and energy intensive, limitations which can prove more crippling for SMEs. There is a need to provide EU dried food SMEs with a technology which will help to remain competitive in the EU and global dried food sectors. Preliminary research conducted to date suggests that the application of high power ultrasound (HPU) for the dehydration of porous materials may be very effective in processes in which heat-sensitive materials such as foodstuff have to be treated. HPU is a powerful technology that is safe and environmentally friendly, efficient and economical. High-intensity ultrasonic vibrations are capable of affecting mass transfer processes with the result of increasing the drying rate of materials, thereby permitting the use of lower temperatures or shorter treatment times.  This process thus shows promise for assisting the dehydration of fruits, vegetables and other foods, preserving the quality attributes of the food products and during this project a HPU based pre-treatment method will be developed. A prototype will be built and tested prior to conventional drying processes to improve the added value of the dried product and enable faster, more cost effective and energy efficient drying of food, which will empower and equip SMEs from the European dried food industry to compete against the growing threat of global competition and large multinationals.
