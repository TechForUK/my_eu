In addition, when students find a job, there find some lacks in their training.\r\nWe want our School Training Programme to offer an answer to our students\u2019 actual training needs. That\u2019s the reason why our mobility project aims at the teaching of key competences and soft skills that will play a key role in our students\u00b4 search for a place in the labour world.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019d like our programmes to have enough flexibility to add and adapt its skills and contents to the demands of our society and that, through the mobility of our Hospitality and Catering teachers there will be a common aim for updating and training.\r\n\r\nHaving these objectives in mind, we\u2019ve taken advantage of the contact we\u2019ve got with a specialised vocational training school in Redbridge, London, as a result of a Comenius Regio partnership about the fostering of enterpreuning skills that the Provincial Directorate of MECD in Melilla coordinates with Redbridge Educational District.\r\nThrough this partnership, Hospitality and Catering teachers from both countries have met and visited each other. As a consequence of these meetings, both teams of professionals have drawn the conclusion that students from these cities are alike (families in risk of social exclusion, long term unemployed, demotivated students facing similar situations year after year and a vast majority of students with an immigrant background). Nevertheless, Redbridge School has higher employability  rates among students, and above all, updated teaching resources.\r\nAfter discussing possible solutions to this problem, we believe that a mobility project for our students and teachers may be the best solution. Through this project we\u2019ll design formative agreements  for participating teachers and training agreements for students\u2019 practices that will give an answer to our teaching and learning gaps and will help us teachers improve our programmes and practices making them more attractive and updated and students giving them more qualifications and making them more interesting for potentional businesses, so that they can change their prospectives for their own future.", "http://www.redbridge-college.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-015139_1"], ["6NA", "London Calling", "British Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association", 14803.0, "Momentum World CIC (Momentum) is the co-ordinating organisation for this project.
