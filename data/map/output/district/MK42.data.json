More than 75 years of visual and audio memories are in serious danger to be lost due to the natural instability cellulose acetate (CA) and Cellulose nitrate (CN) materials.\nThese physical media have helped to preserve the cultural material that is a real witness of socio-cultural European evolution in the recent era. It encompasses the possibility to understand the development of new arts such as cinema, photography or graphic arts and also the preservation of the socio-cultural memories of citizens located in major and local museums worldwide.\nConservators consider two approaches when planning treatments to extend the useful lifetime of cultural materials: preventive or passive and active or interventive. But in case of cellulose derivates and other components of the movie or photos, once initiated, degradation cannot be prevented, reversed or stopped, but only inhibited or slowed. Inhibitive conservation of cellulose derivates can either involve the removal or reduction of factors causing degradation including light, oxygen, acids, fungus and relative humidity among others, as well as cost-sensitive processes such as freeze. \nNEMOSINE improves the traditional storage solutions, such as freeze storage (below 5\u00baC), by developing an innovative package with the main goal of energy saving and extent conservation time. NEMOSINE will develop: i) High O2 barrier and Active packaging using non-odour additives, ii) Active acid adsorbers based on functionalized Metal Organic Framework (MOFs) integrated in innovative structures, iii) Gas detection sensors to monitoring AA, O2 & NO, iv) Multi-scale modelling to correlate degradation & sensors signals, v)Packaging with modular design to fulfil the technical & economical requirements of the different CH made by cellulose derivates.", 407760.0, 6356416.0, "NEMOSINE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_212830_974542220"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8NW", "\u201cPersonalized education for the 21st century skills at Ergli Secondary School\u201d", "Camestone Lower School", 12187.0, "The development vision of Ergli High School is, \"Personalised education - opportunity and achievement for all.\" Personalised education is and education that is modern and competitive because it develops the skills of the 21st century - the used of modern technology, communication and collaboration, initiative and creativity, based on the needs of each and every student and providing them with opportunities and achievements.

We have chosen particular courses that are relevant to our needs. These involve;\r\n-intensive language learning with native speaker teachers, \r\n-language teaching methodology,\r\n-professional discussion of aspects of language teaching such as improving literacy through language teaching, \r\n-ideas for supporting colleagues in partner schools, \r\n-use of ICT and new technologies to support language learning, and \r\n-supporting pupils with special educational needs and low basic skills. \r\n\r\nWe would like to involve two members of staff in these training courses. We intend that both members of staff will go to Spain and France during the length of this project. This will then mean that they are in a position to be able to establish a high-quality language provision within the MFL Department and disseminate skills and knowledge to other members of staff within the school. They will share the ideas, knowledge and resources gained with members of staff in other departments to share ideas relevant to them, and to develop more cross curricular work and cooperation across departments. \r\n\r\nParticipants will experience an improvement in professional development and teaching strategies and methods, in language competence, confidence in their abilities and in their future career prospects. They will have a greater inter-cultural understanding post-course, and we will be able to experience and observe best practice in other countries. They will improve their communication skills, both verbal and social, and their wellbeing and lifestyle as teachers will be improved due to an increase in motivation and confidence. They will be more confident to use language spontaneously in the classroom and will be in a position to be more flexible within their teaching role as they will be able to teach both languages to a high standard.\r\n\r\nAttainment will be improved; we will be able to hold more cultural and international events in school to inspire pupils, with better resources and a more positive and engaging learning environment. Pupil engagement will be improved due to better teaching strategies, use of the target language and a greater awareness of other cultures. Students' horizons will be broadened by real links with students abroad and they will therefore have more self belief in the possibility to travel in the future. \r\n\r\nThere will be an impact on the attainment of pupils with special educational needs as the courses will in part focus on how to best support these pupils through language learning. \r\n\r\nThere will also be a positive impact on our local community.

The units will be offered in an international learning environment, enriching students with both subject specific knowledge as well as a meaningful international experience.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project will be the following:\r\n- The partners in the project aim to work towards a the mobility of students and workers between the partner Colleges (for school based training) and industry (for work based training). During the exchanges, students and workers in training should be able to complete a part of their curriculum in floristry abroad. In this project we focus on floristry in regards to mobility of students and labour to raise standards of education in floristry and improve quality of the branch throughout Europe;\r\n- These international learning units will be taught at schools, in work-based situations, and through the development of digital classrooms and MOOCs.\r\n- Through the development of units based on the core subjects from the existing curricula, the partners will be able to offer students and industry more flexible learning paths to the European labour market through mobility projects at international partner schools; \r\n- By using ECVET principles in this project, the participating partners are better prepared to exchange their students with other institutes in the future (experience with ECVET).\r\n- The exchange of students on international learning modules gives the partners involved in the project the opportunity to develop a common assessment and certification system. This will allow for international learning units to be transparent and assessed along a common transparent standard throughout the partner colleges and organisations.\r\n- The partners will commit to guard the transparency and quality of these common international units, assessments and certification systems by signing agreements that partners will abide by and review every 2 years. \r\n\r\nDuring the project, the partners develop the following outputs:\r\n1) Understand the competences of responsibility, Complexity of tasks and procedures, Independence, Scope, Ambiguity, Change and Range;\r\n2) Training program for an outcome based learning; \r\n3) Overview of National Qualifications linked to EQF;\r\n4) Transparency of curricula of the partner countries,\r\n5) Transparency of assessments;\r\n6) Systematic use of ECVET principles amongst the partners;\r\n7) Guidelines and procedures for recognition of the units (learning outcomes) for quality assurance;\r\n8) Common reference unit of learning outcomes (with standards) for mobility;\r\n9) Learning units and assessment level 3, 4, 5, 6, and crossovers at level 4;\r\n10) Policy recommendations/guidelines;\r\n11) ECVET and EQAVET agreement;\r\n12) Certification system for assessors including assessment methodology;\r\n13) Digital classrooms and massive open online courses.\r\n\r\nTeaching/training activities:\r\n- Training program for an outcome based learning;\r\n- A carrousel of 20 students (financed by a KA1 project) will be sent to pilot the implementation of the draft international learning units;\r\n- Nationally certified judges in floristry will pilot the implementation of the draft certification system;\r\n- A carrousel of 20 students (financed by a KA1 project) will be sent to pilot the implementation of the international learning units and their assessments;\r\n- Around 30 florists will pilot the implementation of the MOOCs.\r\n\r\nDuring the project period, the project will involve:\r\n- 50 vocational florist students \r\n- Teachers and staff members from partner colleges\r\n- 30 florists in training\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: \r\nThe partners will meet every 3 months to work on project activities and outputs.

The vocational courses are the starting points to increase the standard and quality of floristry in Europe. The international learning units will allow students, professionals in training and adults to educate themselves to a minimum level throughout Europe by strengthening the vocational courses. Furthermore, these international learning units will be done in colleges, work-based and in MOOCs. This allows students mobility throughout partner colleges to be assessed in the same way in all partner schools through a transparent assessment system and through a quality certification system. The same applies to adults in training.
