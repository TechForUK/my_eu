Pupils would greatly benefit from Erasmus\u2019 aim to provide opportunities for individuals to improve their skills, thereby gaining cultural awareness and enhancing their employability. We also believe that it would be beneficial to our school to work with other organisations to ensure that our pupils receive the best possible learning experience.At present, Spanish is taught across Key Stage 2 by a Spanish teacher employed by the Primary Languages Network. While this has been a largely positive experience, it would be useful to have greater level of skill amongst the regular teaching staff, none of whom have previous experience of speaking Spanish.We hope to use the project as a means of increasing the skills, understanding and confidence of teaching staff, The project would include mobilities for the Spanish co-ordinator alongside a Teaching Assistant responsible for supporting pupils with English as an Additional Language. We believe that an experience abroad would be the most beneficial as the immersion course would provide intensive language training, improving skills, understanding and competencies regarding the language and the culture of Spain. The intensive language training will to enable them to teach Spanish, thus reducing our reliance upon an external specialist teacher and creating a more sustainable model of teaching Spanish within our school. Another aim of our project is to raise attainment and the profile of languages across the school. Spanish as a subject is currently being co-ordinated by a recently qualified teacher, supported by the Assistant Head and the Primary Language Network. Improving the co-ordinator\u2019s skills and competency would develop the capacity to successfully manage the subject, raising attainment and boosting the profile of the subject throughout the school. One of our school aims outlined in our mission statement is to be a community that fosters positive relationships with Global Communities \u2013 supporting a variety of charities, links with schools, exchange visits and learning Spanish. St Anne\u2019s recently held a Spanish Week. During this week of Spanish themed activities, we forged a link with a school in Malaga through our Spanish teacher. Children across Key Stage 2 wrote letters to children in Spain as well as engaging in activities to learn more about Spanish culture through cooking, ICT based research, dancing and art. Through the process of eTwinning and international links, we hope to expand on this, by engaging in regular correspondence and undertaking projects which are engaging and relevant to the children. We hope to expand the impact beyond the children and teaching staff by engaging governors and parents.  During our next Spanish Week, we hope to host a workshop where children can present their work to parents and pass on the skills they have gained in their Spanish lessons.As a part of the Primary Languages Network, St Anne\u2019s will be able to share the impact of the project with schools from across St Helens, Warrington, Knowsley and Wigan. Resources can be shared using the Network\u2019s online sharing centre and resources and ideas of best practice can be exchanged at the regular meetings.", "http://www.stannessutton.co.uk", "St Anne's Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023272_coordinator"], ["4AT", "Improving the profile and development of the Spanish language and culture throughout our school", "Sutton Manor Community Primary School", 25923.0, "Sutton Manor was a strong mining area but, following the closure of the mine, that identity has gone.  Although the community is close, many of our pupils have little knowledge of life experiences outside the immediate area and many families struggle financially.   \r\n\r\nMany of our staff and pupils have very little understanding of other languages and there is a feeling that learning another language is not important. Our school is in an area of social deprivation where attitudes towards other cultures can sometimes be negative. We believe that at this time when  the UK is set to leave the EU, it is essential that we offer our pupils opportunities to develop an understanding of the world beyond their own local area and to create positive attitudes while they are still receptive. We wish to take this further and, through this project, we want to have an effect on our whole community, encouraging open attitudes towards others. We want our pupils to see Europe in a positive light and embrace future opportunities available to them.\r\n\r\nWe achieved the International Schools Award 3 years ago and are currently renewing this award.  Where possible, we try to bring Spain into other areas of the curriculum and have managed to learn Spanish songs and rhymes for class and assembly as well as links in Geography and maths.  \r\n\r\nOur project objectives reflect our whole school ethos and are in line with our school development plan. They have been established through discussion with the headteacher, governors and SLT and also through seeking support and guidance from colleagues who are members of the Janet Lloyd Primary Languages Network, some of whom have run similar project successfully. \r\n\r\nWe envisage a project involving the majority of our staff, which will have profound long-term benefits throughout the school and local community.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the languages coordinator, all of our staff are at a beginner or near beginner\u2019s level of Spanish. As part of this project all of our staff will participate in immersion courses in Spain. It is therefore imperative that as many staff and TAs as possible begin to learn more Spanish and gain confidence.  \r\n\r\nChanges resulting from the project will include:\r\nOur staff will be excited and more knowledgeable of Spanish so that they are not fearful of \u2018having a go\u2019.  This will then inspire our children. The more staff are exposed to language learning and activities, the more they will be able to pass these on to the children.\r\n\r\nOur language teaching, will move away from our current provision which involves one teacher delivering short, infrequent sessions of languages to Key Stage 2 to an embedded, sustainable model whereby all staff are trained to the extent that they are able to take an active role in language teaching and take responsibility for pupils learning within their own class just as they do with other curriculum subjects. \r\n\r\nOur pupils will an excellent experience of language learning which will encourage them to continue through secondary school and into their adult lives, making them into positive global citizens.\r\n\r\nAs this is a whole school project we already have an outline  plan for how to manage it; Our participants will be well supported and prepared for their involvement in the project.\r\n\r\nOur MFL coordinator will take a leading role in managing the project with the support of the headteacher and SMT. She has already begun preparatory activities such as the assessment of the abilities and knowledge of the current staff and will do a further assessment to find out what staff wish to learn and where they feel their weaknesses lie.\r\n\r\nShe will have contact with other schools who have taken part in similar projects to get their advice and has already begun to liaise directly with the course provider to discuss practical aspects.\r\n\r\nWe intend that this project will have a huge and lasting effect on our pupils and community in terms of attitude towards other people and cultures, counteract negative stereotypes and encourage enthusiasm and respect for other languages and cultures which will continue into their later lives and impact on their future educational and career choices.\r\n\r\nDissemination is a vitally important aspect of our project as we intend to make changes within our school and community and positively impact on other schools for many years to come.\r\n\r\nWe will have a clear dissemination plan. All participants will be actively involved in dissemination activities. We will also involve pupils and there will be activities planned before during and after the project. The establishment of our school as a hub of local support will mean that dissemination will continue in the long term.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation process will be overseen by our head and implemented by our MFL coordinator. Ultimately, we believe that if our children enjoy Spanish and enjoy their learning and progress, then the project will have been a success.", "http://www.suttonmanor.st-helens.sch.uk/", "Sutton Manor Community Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046827_coordinator"], ["5QX", "Let's learn French Together", "Thatto Heath Community Primary School", 4320.0, "Thatto Heath Primary school is in the borough of St Helens in the North West of England. The school is surrounded by social housing developments and is situated in an area of severe economic deprivation. We aim to run a one-year Key Action 1 project of staff training, involving 18 mobilities to allow staff to attend intensive immersion courses in France. \r\n\r\nOur development needs were identified through observations, book scrutiny and staff audits.\r\n\r\nWe have selected PQ France Ltd to be our course provider as they offer opportunities to create a bespoke training experience for our staff, which will meet our needs and enrich our curriculum. Two members of staff will take part in a course in October 2018. They will use their new skills and knowledge of the region of France to plan a bespoke course with PQ France for 16 staff to attend in April 2019.\r\n\r\nOur organisation\u2019s main areas for improvement in terms of quality development and internationalisation, are to:\r\n- increase staff language competencies and their confidence to teach French\r\n- develop staff understanding of primary language methodology\r\n- deepen staff and pupils\u2019 intercultural understanding \r\n- enhance our European dimension.\r\n\r\nOur project aims to enable participants to work on their personal French skills during intensive language lessons:\r\n- take part in and experience cultural activities linked to the primary curriculum \r\n- learn about the methodology of second language (L2) teaching in Key Stage 1 and 2\r\n- gather and develop cross curricular resources \r\n- spend a day in a French primary school\r\n\r\nAt the end of the project we envisage that the long-term impact will be significant for all participants and colleagues in school. All teaching staff will have new skills and will be motivated to teach outstanding French lessons.\r\n\r\nParticipants\u2019 speaking and listening skills will be enhanced which will be evident in their teaching and therefore motivate pupils; they will have gained invaluable experience to cater for all learning styles and make language learning fun. Time spent in a French primary school will also impact on their teaching practice and provide them with a range of authentic teaching resources, cross curricular resources and creative teaching ideas.\r\n\r\nOur pupils will benefit from improved learning opportunities and an opportunity to learn about French life for children of their age, providing a real purpose for their learning.\r\n\r\nLonger term, there will be a change in whole-school practice. Participants will be more involved with lessons and take a lead in activities; their skills and confidence will be shared with teacher colleagues who will in turn be inspired and motivated and pupils will leave Thatto Heath with a love of language learning and a desire to take this further in the high school education.", "http://www.thattoheath.st-helens.sch.uk", "Thatto Heath Community Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047294_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["3DA", "RBN", "St Helens Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA9"}
