The link between metabolic and inflammatory disease is getting stronger, raising hopes for novel therapeutic targets to be exploited clinically. Clinical evidence generated by the Academic partners of the Athero-B-Cell Consortium demonstrates that CVD is associated with pro- and anti-atherogenic B cell responses. We aim to use existing proteomic, transcriptomic and miRNA data generated from large-scale clinical studies in previous EU-funded collaborative efforts to decipher the pathways that favor pro- and anti-atherogenic B cell functions in order to unravel a new set of therapeutic targets and refine potential vaccine strategies for CVD. The selection and validation of targets will be made possible by substantial technological advance achieved by the participating SMEs that are world leaders in the field of bioinformatics, genetic modification including humanised mouse models, and 3rd generation antisense drugs with locked nucleic-acid (LNA) design that are in Phase II human trials.  Academia-led innovation includes high-resolution methodologies such as CyTOF and ImageStream to interrogate available samples from clinical trials and the ability to validate the targets of interest in accredited models of CVD. The validation in vivo and in vitro of such targets will feed into the SME pipeline accelerating the process of drug discovery. The recent clinical success of 3rd generation antisense drugs underscores the advantage of the Athero-B-Cell approach: the seamless transition from validation tools to clinical applications.

Internships abroad require financial support in order to give as many students as possible this opportunity.The students work in a broad spectrum of companies, from planning agencies, design companies, and forestry schools, to gardens for vegetables and flowers.  They thereby not only test the knowledge they amassed while at school, but they also learn the first steps in beginning a career, which may not be widespread in Austria, such as specialized perennial nurseries, planning agencies, that also execute plans, nursery facilities, etc.  By working abroad in a country with a foreign language, the students can deepen their understanding of the English language.  This should also awaken an interest to think outside the national border, when the students choose a future place of work or study.  In the first phase of the project, a total of 20 students will be placed in 6 European countries:  8 in Great Britain, two in Ireland, two in Italy, two in Sweden, one in Portugal and 6 in Germany.  12 students specialize in the market gardening program, while the other 8 focus on garden and landscape design.

We provide the students with the appropriate information and insurance.  All the participants can contact us, the advisors, at any time via email or cellphone.  The interns are required to keep a journal for the duration of their internship.  This is necessary for the positive completion of the internship.The internships can be considered a success if the students integrate their work abroad into their plans for the future as a matter of course.In the long-term, we are working on building an informal network of companies and institutions, which will share our commitment to the internship education of the students and offer young people the chance to broaden their horizons.", "http://www.belderbos.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016488_1"], ["5AA", "Deine Chance - Lerne in Europa", "Holy Trinity CE Primary School", 132251.0, "Background and project objectives (aims):\r\nGlobalisation and internationalisation increasingly shape our education, our economy and our society.

The workgroup is part of Elly-Heuss-Knapp's Europe-strategy who is the official coordinator of this application. This regional cooperation is based on the belief that the necessity for a stronger collaboration within Europe is needed, in order to be able to take part in shaping a continuously more globalized world, politically, occupationally, and culturally. Understanding and benefiting Europe as an opportunity: for these purpose our cooperation wants to contribute to. Appreciation for European integration does not develop by itself though nor by talking about it. \r\n\r\nThus the main goals for this project are:\r\no an active citizenship, European consciousness, and democracy\r\no intercultural and cross-generational education and lifelong learning\r\no Institutions and methods of improvement in quality (incl. school improvement)\r\n\r\nOccupational mobility abroad provides unique possibilities, for apprentices, students as well as teachers, to develop their expertise just as competence for methods and social interactions. Consequently, participants further develop personal and organisational skills, which sustainably contributes to a more globalized and modern apprenticeship in the interest of extensive quality development of all participating institutions from home and abroad. Students therefore enhance their national and international employment outlook and make an advance in their professional and personal self-manifestation. This applies similarly for teachers.\r\n\r\nThis application addresses several participant groups: students, teachers, trainers and school staff. Specific attention is put upon the expansion of the group of participants in order to enable not only students and teachers but also staff of the enticing companies and the school as a whole to profit from the school\u2019s international expansion. Thus, the school\u2019s Europe-strategy reaches beyond the school\u2019s boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the teaching staff follows a certain standard, which can be adjusted as agreed upon with partner organisations on-site.\r\nIt applies for a 5-day stay (+2 days of travel) at the cooperating school and includes visiting class, communication about subject/topics of their own field, sustainable development, social aspects of everyday surroundings in school, etc. as well as getting in touch with partners of occupational education concerning sojourn of students or teachers in the host country in the future, e.g. visitation of companies etc.\r\n\r\nThe learner\u2019s mobility applies: Partnering companies enable an insight on and participation in diverse and relevant procedures. An example is the business \u201cHofzuckerb\u00e4ckerei Heiner\u201d in Vienna, which allows apprentices in a four-week internship to get in touch with the production of Austrian confection of pastry, dessert, and Viennese coffee specialties. Similar insights on regional and national special features (e.g. the Finnish educational system) will be offered to other participants as well.\r\n\r\nOverall the application applies to 62 participants (31students, 31teacher and school staff). Students are apprentices in the dual system, students of the vocational school, and students in of social pedagogy. In the selection process vital characteristics are personal attitude, expertise, and school performance.\r\nThe teaching staff is composed of teachers, who represent a broad spectrum of occupational (e.g. production technology, consultation and sale, etc.) and non-occupational (English, German, etc.) subjects.

The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.\r\nParticipants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 96 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. \r\nMedien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.\r\nResults: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened. Language skills and self-confidence are encouraged. They will change their view on Europe and the European Community. The commitment of the school to praticipate in the program Erasmus+ will be seen positively.\r\nThe educational staff: Learn impulses and appropriate tools for school development, strengthening of the European idea and internationalisation of the vocational colleges, expand intercultural competence and train intercultural sensitivity, international networkling and networking of partners with own school projects (e.g. Fair Trade , UNICEF , worldwide missionary projects SMMP , school against racism), promotion of young professionals.\r\nLong-term benefits: The students gain an edge in the career, it is a gain of experiences, self-confidence is strengthened and advanced language skills shape the future career. Young professionals are encouraged. The students  consolidate their decisions.\r\nPositive image and - so far - unique feature of the three vocational colleges of Walburgisschule Menden SMMP.

It comprises VET-PLONG - Erasmus PRO- long-term mobility of VET learners\", \"VET-SHORT - Short term mobility of VET learners\" und \"staff mobility\". The overall aim of the project is to promote the professional intercultural competence of the participating students and to extend the development of teaching material at BSBJ, both at the level of course content and didactic methodology.     \r\na) Seven students from the College of Education and Social Care will complete a six-month, long-term mobility placement (VET-PLONG - Erasmus PRO- long-term mobility of VET learners) in social pedagogic settings run by our project partners in Denmark, Austria, Spain, and the United Kingdom where they will be engaged in their individual developmental process to become trained, professional pedagogic staff .   \r\nb) 20 students of the Higher Vocational School for Social Assistants will take part in a two-week, short- term mobility programme (VET-SHORT - Short term mobility of VET learners) run by our project partner the Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel TREGEY-Rive de Garonne in Bordeaux in which they will the opportunity to come to terms with issues associated with their vocational field: social care and social pedagogy.\r\nc). 32 members of staff from the BSBJ will participate in further professional training (observing vocational practices, job-shadowing, engaging in professional discussions and exchanges of experience) spending 4 days in social pedagogic institutions and settings of our project partners in Denmark, Croatia, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom.\r\nAll phases of the project (preparation, implementation, evaluation and further development) will be guided and supported by the Erasmus + Team at BSBJ.  Information material and documentation to ensure the smooth-running of the respective mobility programmes have been prepared which offer both participants and our project partners an orientation and a structural framework for their work.  A compulsory one-year course (three hours per week) prepares students for their long-term mobility placements.  Four members of staff will be responsible for preparing students taking part in the short-term mobility programme as part of their normal lessons.  Teaching staff receive informational material about the educational systems of their destination countries to support their own research trips.\r\nThe implementation of all mobility projects is based on intensive co-operation between the BSBJ and our project partners outside Germany.  Professional guidance is jointly organized. A great emphasis is placed on specialized discussions and exchanges at a professional level about the development of the curriculum and course material. The results of the project will be followed up though workshop days, conferences, discussions and exchanges in lessons themselves. \r\nWe expect students and members of staff participating in the project to develop their competences, particularly in the area of intercultural learning, to develop their reflective skills, and to enhance their constructive approaches to solving conflicts.  The ability to change perspectives and to empathise with others from different cultural backgrounds is a fundamental competence for early years educators and social assistants.  Students, no less than teachers, will extend their repertoire of conceptual and methodological skills through the experience of the mobility programmes and extend their development on more personal levels too.  Such developmental processes cannot be achieved by the internal resources of the school (through lessons, lesson planning, tests, conferences etc) alone.  Changing perspectives and questioning of one\u2019s own handling strategies requires personal experience and reflection upon that experience.  Gaining new personal experience supports sustained learning to a strikingly large extent. \r\nParticipants\u2019 visits to social pedagogic settings and institutions also guarantees the strengthening of communicative skills in foreign languages through the intensive exchanges on professional topics of mutual interest.  \r\nWe expect the consolidation of international networks to have a very positive effect on the quality of teaching and the practice of social care and education in Frankfurt and further afield in Europe through our project partners in Europe.\r\nWe are convinced that the project, \u201cPedagogical Variety in Europe\u201d will have a sustained positive influence on the whole school community of BSBJ and that of our partners.

The reason for this is that the number of children aged 0-6 in day-care centers with a migrant or refugee background is steadily increasing and we hope that the professionalism in dealing with multinational children's groups like it has been normal for a long  time in German kindergartens in Europe, our students will be taught a variety of methods of inclusion, language support and everyday pedagogical design, which are becoming increasingly important for their professional practice.\r\nThis internationalization of parts of the training also serves to sharpen our school profile and secure the location.\r\nGoals of the project are:\r\n-Advancement of professionalism in the field of early childhood education, educational activities in multinational children's groups, inclusion, language development concepts and German as a foreign language.\r\n-Improving multilingualism and intercultural competence.\r\n- Building social capital and a Europe-friendly attitude.\r\n-Increasing mobility, flexibility and autonomous living arrangements as well as living and working abroad.\r\n- Building international cooperation and professional exchange\r\n-Continuing development of pedagogical concepts and promoting comparability and recognition of education and qualifications.\r\nWe are sending eleven students with different cultural backgrounds who have completed the academic part of the educator training and then complete the probationary year in whole or in part in institutions for child and youth welfare / education in other European countries. Our students complete the recognition year in kindergartens in Turkey, Poland, Great Britain and Spain. They are usually working as second force in children's groups of 0-6 years with about 15-20 children of different nationalities and needs and are visited once by a teacher for teaching and training purposes. At the same time, the visit also serves the job-shadowing, the professional exchange and mutual further education as well as getting to know the facilities and the typical culture of the country.\r\nThe methodology of our project procedure begins with information, selection and consultation of the participants. Following:\r\n-Acquisition of new cooperation partners in Italy and France\r\n-Contact care and new training agreements with the cooperation partners\r\n-Learning agreements with the participants\r\n-Preparatory lessons, language course, German as a foreign language\r\n-Assistance in applying for visas, organizing housing and arrival and departure\r\n-Scheduling and conducting visits, teaching and counseling, as well as professional exchange\r\n-Contact and final talks via videoconference and\r\n-evaluation of the project\r\nDissemination of the project results in the school board, at the open day, at the cooperation partners of the school (local organisations), in special pedagogical committees, on the homepage, in the magazine of the Diakonie Ruhr and the local press.\r\nWe expect that our above mentioned goals will be fulfilled and our participants will be strengthened in their European identity and this in their educational work here, for example with refugee children or in a professional activity in other European countries.
