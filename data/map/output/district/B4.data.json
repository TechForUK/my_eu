They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition.

The ongoing exponential growth in network traffic, however, is pushing current technology, whose data rates had increased over several decades, towards its limits. It is widely accepted that the nonlinear transmission effects in optical fibre are now a major limiting factor in modern fibre-optic communication systems. Nonlinear properties of the optical fibre medium limit the conventional techniques to increase capacity by simply increasing signal power. Most of the transmission technologies utilized today have been originally developed for linear (wired or wireless) communication channels. Over the past several decades, significant improvements in data rates were obtained by improvements and modifications within the overall linear transmission paradigm. However, there is much evidence that this trend is going to end within the next decade due to fibre nonlinearity.

In addition, SHIFT is a \u201cpriority topic\u201d as it is an innovative approach to increase efficiency of public expenditure and investment in education, including new funding models such as public-private partnerships.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, SHIFT has the objective of alleviating the financial burden of access to and participation in HE of students while increasing the efficiency of public spending in HE by developing an innovative model of virtuous Public Private Partnership based on a financial instrument and model (mix of endowment fund and investment fund) that will generate increased financial resources to be distributed as grants, matching grants and soft loans for HE students. SHIFT is a new funding model that pools financial resources from both the public and private sectors, serving the dual purpose of\r\n1. increasing efficiency of public expenditure: SHIFT enhances sustainability of public resources by generating additional funding opportunities for scholarships of university students. The public funds allocated into the SHIFT model (the endowment fund) will be invested (through the investment fund) and only the profits generated will be disbursed (through grants and soft loans) to students, hence keeping intact the capital (here the sustainability of the public funds)\r\n2. mobilising private resources: SHIFT establishes a virtuous mechanism of public and private partnership. Not only SHIFT pools funds from public and private sectors, but also will consolidate public and private attitudes towards facilitating access to finance for HE students. \r\n\r\nSHIFT brings together 7 partners from 5 countries representing HE system, students association and NGOs, private sector. Such diversity adds value to the partnership that has the complementary skills, experience and expertise to carry out the following activities:\r\n1. Map Financing Dynamics of HE\r\n2. Develop the SHIFT Innovative Financial Model\r\n3. Test and Validate through Stress Testing the innovative financial model\r\n4. Develop the SHIFT Implementation Package for its adoption in HEIs\r\n\r\nThe methodology is technical (i.e. financial engineering) and operational (i.e. governance structure) and is based on the sequenced approach of\r\nMapping -->Development --> Validation/Stress Testing --> Implementation\r\n\r\nSHIFT main results are:\r\na) innovative financial model, developed, tested and validated through financial stress testing: partners will develop and validate the model and will outline the structure of the financial instrument (size; investment horizon; asset class; risk profile; etc) and the governance mechanism (composition of the governance structure; representation of public, private and social sectors; division of responsibilities between financial management and operations; etc)\r\nb) the implementation package to apply and deploy the innovative model: SHIFT will produce an implementation package detailing the technical, operational and administrative aspects of how to implement the SHIFT model and formalize the involvement of public and private participants (i.e. Memorandum of Understanding, Terms of Reference for fund managers, etc)\r\n\r\nSHIFT will produce tangible impact at systemic level for the HE system across EU: the innovative financial model will bring about threefold impact:\r\n1. increased financial resources to enhance HE access and participation\r\n2. improved sustainability of public resources for HE\r\n3. innovative PPP mechanism\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, SHIFT \u201csupport HEIs to implement necessary reforms in line with the 2011 EU Modernisation Agenda and its priority areas\u201d.

Through FEFE, learners will develop key entrepreneurial skills: the ability to make better financial decisions, be better able to understand and access alternative sources of finance and be more willing to trade across international boundaries.  Developing these skills will encourage more learners to become entrepreneurs and will enable them to grow their own enterprises more effectively.  FEFE is fully in line with the horizontal and sectoral priorities of the Erasmus + Programme:1.

The EU is focusing on entrepreneurship as a key driver of economic growth and job creation and to achieve this investing in entrepreneurial education and support is regarded as a key priority for immediate intervention (Entrepreneurship Action Plan 2020, p. 5).  The EC report \u2018Rethinking Education:  Investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\u2019 argues that there should be much effort concentrated on developing young people\u2019s transversal skills \u2018\u2026particularly entrepreneurial skills\u2026[because they]\u2026not only contribute to new business creation but also to the employability of young people\u2019 (p.3).  Financial literacy is widely accepted to be a vital part of entrepreneurship education.   The EU Commission Working Group on Entrepreneurship Education (2014) identified financial literacy as one of three exemplar learning outcomes for entrepreneurship education programmes (pg. 44).    OBJECTIVESFEFE will develop financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills of students completing VET and HE programmes.  Specifically, FEFE will address each of the financial abilities which have been recently identified by the world-leading international accountancy body, the ACCA, as key to the financial education of entrepreneurs: 1. Ability to distinguish between personal and business finances;2. To be a competent buyer of financial services; 3. To anticipate the business\u2019 future financial needs under alternative scenarios; 4. To understand the decision-making process of finance providers; 5. To relate the business\u2019s financial needs to a country\u2019s regulatory and fiscal framework; 6. To exercise financial management.

Rising life expectancy and increasing numbers of older people in the population in Europe means a growing number of individuals are affected by visual and hearing impairments. Thus, raising general awareness of problems and potential solutions is essential to maximising individual quality of life and minimising social isolation. A key challenge related to the quality of life of older people with impairments is the training and skills of the professionals working in care services addressed for this specific target group. Many of the organisations participating in SENSNET are members of any of the European networks ENVITER and HIPEN that are supporting the project and that represent organisations of professionals and experts in sensory impairments in 21 EU countries. Through surveys, events, workshops and their daily work both European networks and the partners in SENSNET have collected information about the concrete learning needs of the professionals working with ageing people with sensory impairments.The main SENSNET activities are, among others:- Design of the Methodological guide for the learning programme- Development of the training materials for professionals working with ageing people with hearing and/or visual impairments will be created in such area as, lighting and ergonomics and accessibility in society and in the daily life (access to culture and access to information and communication media)- Creation of online learning platform for professionals working with ageing people with hearing and visual impairments.- Training courses for professionals.- Organisation of two multiplier events in Hungary and Poland.The project will apply innovative approaches of the learning methodology, such as:- Demand-driven training. Based on the bottom-up approach to identify the training needs of the target groups, the partners will extract information that will be used for developing tailored training modules using a problem-solving approach.- Collaborative tutorship. Once students have finished the learning and mentorship phase they will become mentors of other students through a direct contact using the social community. - Co-creation and open innovation. The project will create a learning social community to foster the collaboration between learners, teachers and mentors.The most important results of the project are: 1) Creation of the European Academy that provides training for professionals working with ageing people with visual and/or hearing impairments, 2) Creation of a European learning community of professionals working with ageing people with visual and/or hearing impairments, 3) Increased the knowledge base of the partners to have a more accurate awareness of professionals\u2019 learning needs and priorities, 4) Improved skills of professionals involved in the trainings, 5) Creation a comprehensive training strategy for professionals working with ageing people with hearing and visual impairments, etc.The project involves seven partners from six different European countries: Spain, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Bulgaria and United Kingdom.

The expected impact on the target groups is to improve their occupational qualification and professional skills in sensory impairments area, especially related to hearing and visual problems. All of them will be a part of European learning community of professionals working with ageing people with visual and/or hearing impairments. The final beneficiaries are ageing people over 60 with visual and/or hearing impairments.

These objectives are more specifically defined in the so called Modernisation Agenda (EC 2011). More specifically it sets a goal to improve the quality and relevance of higher education. In this process external evaluation and self-assessment are seen in a key role!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there are plenty of methods for both self- and cross-evaluation, there is a lack of models for a comprehensive approach, taking account the needs to increase international collaboration and improve international comparability in HEIs.  There have been many European projects on QA, but they do not cover still existing problems with accreditation such as required resources, complexity, delays between the evaluation rounds, poor feedback, poor quality loop and distance from continuous education development. There is a need for more flexible evaluation models and processes with peers to reduce the inertia of heavy accreditations/evaluations in HEIs. Contemporary processes are too laborious and increasingly demanding, binary evaluation lacks feedback on how to improve, and moreover, more and more reporting is demanded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQAEMarketPlace4HEI -project proposes a flexible and collaborative method, processes and tools for degree program / higher education evaluation, as a complement for weighty/ponderous accreditations. The innovativeness of the project lies in the collaborative model of quality assurance that can complement accreditations and existing QA systems. The project promotes and strengthens the European cooperation in quality assurance while designing and piloting new kind of continuous, accessible, cooperation based model, tools and a virtual platform (the Market Place) supporting so called cross-sparring between institutions. Cross-sparring is to be understood as a process to make feedback more collaborative, concrete and objective, thanks to critical, but discreet brainstorming sessions, where strategies can be discussed, repeatedly contributing to the quality assurance with a critical external view. As in sport, a sparring partner helps to keep eyes on the objectives, learn from experience and stimulate reflectivity. This approach is beneficial both for the institution evaluated, which will get a more objective view on its strengths and potential improvements, and for the sparring partner which may identify best practices that can be useful for his own institution. The Market Place serves as a tool for finding the best possible sparring partners as well as a forum for networking, sharing experiences, information and best practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project consortium consists of eight European higher education institutions: Reykjavik University, Iceland; Turku University of Applied Sciences, Finland ; Aarhus University, Denmark; Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Finland; Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden; Telecom Bretagne, France; Aston University, United Kingdom and Queens University Belfast, United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project implementation is based on the circular model of quality assurance. The first phase of the project focuses on the self-evaluation and how to ensure the results from different self-evaluation methods provide the right kind of information to enable the best possible pairs for the cross-sparring. Pilot HEIs are supported in this by kick-off workshops. During the second phase, this information is entered to a virtual platform built in this project, the Market Place, where the actual pairing is conducted. Later also the results from the cross-sparrings are entered to the Market Place. Thus the most common development themes can be identified to arrange special theme workshops open for all interested. The Market Place also serves as a database for QA methods, best practices etc. The third phase is about the defining, piloting and refining the cross-sparring method. The continuity of the quality enhancement process after the cross-sparring is supported by collaborative workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project derives from the experiences and actual needs distinguished in the participating institutions to develop the quality assurance process. As a result the degree programs, which are selected for piloting the self-evaluation and cross-sparring processes, are able to exploit the project results directly during the project in their quality assurance and development processes.

There are many good practices among Tredu\u2019s exchanges on different study fields and visible moderate expansion on mobility statistics. The whole concept of Tredu\u2019s international exchanges is wide as Tredu is a very large VET provider in Finland. There are many sectoral work cultures and models. And various work-based development needs on the different study fields, many student profiles and staff work situations. There are also some exchange options for newly graduated students. Student exchange flows are from 2 weeks up to 16 weeks and staff exchanges from one work week up to two, including travel days. Also work-life partners are participating in international mobility actions.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to realize international exchanges in all Tredu\u2019s study fields. Staff exchanges are an important and goal oriented way to develop sectoral and work-based training and an option to personal professional development according to the work tasks. Tredu has started staff development actions with staff learning pathways, one option being international and cultural pathway. This is among the strategic priorities in 2017 and all staff members should place their skills on international aspects during early development discussions and learning marks according to the assigned tasks on development work. One very important way to realize this (competent and skillful learner) is through participation in international exchanges. Other ways to develop international aspects in Tampere region are e.g. work-life exchanges, development projects and active participation in receiving international students to Tredu.\r\n\r\nLong student exchanges (16 weeks) have been a tradition among hotel and restaurant services and they are now extending to other study fields like business and administration. Tredu also provides vocational studies and certificates on these sectors in English language. The most part of student exchanges are from 4 to 10 weeks. The length and scope is decided together with sectoral needs, \u201ctraditions\u201d and receiving partner profiles. Some student exchanges are only 2 weeks and these are mainly aimed for students with special needs. In 2017, the aim is to realize also some exchanges with VALMA (preparatory training) students. These exchanges are accompanied with teachers and professional advisors from Tredu. Also adult VET learners are encouraged to participate on international mobility and there are options for exchanges from 2 weeks onwards. Usually, international exchange period is work-related on-the-job learning periods in local companies abroad. But also work-life visits and study periods in hosting VET schools are expanding the scope of the international experience. According to the experiences, international exchange periods are lifting up the personal independence, responsibility and self-esteem. A well planned period provides a wide conception of European work-life, VET practices and sectoral needs for the participant. It is also possible to learn and experience skills which are not available in Finland. \r\n\r\nTredu has a structured international mobility process that guidelines all the steps in the realization including Tredu\u2019s language and cultural preparation, decision making process and relevant documents, insurance cover etc. Mainly the process is done with online digital documentation in Wilma study register system. Every student mobility is recognized as a part of the learning process according to the ECVET principles. Also informal learning during mobility is recognized in Tredu according to the agreed common principles.\r\n\r\nReceiving partners are mainly organizations with whom Tredu has valid Memorandum of Understanding. These MoUs cover most of the study fields in Tredu. Tredu\u2019s Action Plan for International Affairs was finalized in spring 2016 and the new work model started in the autumn 2016. Since then the process in the real action plan on different study fields have been systematically practiced. International activities and especially mobility among students, staff and company partners have been increasing in recent years.

Project also supports the strategies and goals of the learning organization, including staff development and training activities and worklife partners' participation on mobility actions from Tampere region and abroad.This project is helping the process of Tredu's development work and gives direct impact e.g. on optimal use and planning of the renewed VET-learning premises. There is ongoing large scale renovation and rebuilding process of Tredu's campuses. Many of them have been transferred to locate next to/in the same building with local companies.

Tackling early school leaving is first and foremost an investment in the future. Young people who leave school early are at increased risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. They are often in more precarious and less well-paid jobs than those with training. Generally, children from low education and socially disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely than others to leave the school system early.\r\nWith our project we want to get support  to develop conducive and supportive learning environments that focus on the needs of individual pupils, especially the disadvantaged ones. We want to promote a relevant and engaging learning environment for them.\r\nThe main goal of our project entitled \"Gates and Keys\"  is to create a meaningful and motivating learning atmosphere where they will have the sense of belonging. The pupils should  realize how important it is to possess a school education and a professional education so that they can take care for their future concerns and to become active and responsible citizens who can contribute to Europe. Besides the project will be framed on different levels to reach as many pupils as possible and to motivate them to gain interesting and positive experiences which keeps up their motivation for learning. \r\nWe are aware that extra-curricular activities can not only help students to catch up and to revive their interest in learning, but also help them to re-build a positive relationship with the school and its staff, as well as providing fulfilling activities which can boost self-esteem and reduce frustration.\r\nAs early-school leaving is closely related to social exclusion, we blended the discovery of reasons of social exclusion, such as prejudices and cultural barriers with the factors of early school leaving.  Students will discover themselves through discovering the \"other\". That's why we want to carry out our studies in the form of a transnational project which will offer chances to compare and discover.\r\nFor years, we have been confined to see through the key holes,  which caused us to misconceive the big picture. It is high time we found the right keys and opened the doors.  In order to take our place in the big picture and touch it to better understand , we, 8 partners from different countries or backgrounds,  Turkey, 2 Italian Schools, United Kingdom, Germany, Hungary,Poland and Denmark came together and had the idea of this transnational project which will give us the clues to be able to find the keys in the maze.\r\nMobilities of both students and teachers across Europe constitute an integral part of our approach, along with the use of information and communication technologies. Our students will participate in activities in multinational teams and acquire active, hands-on experiences by engaging with exploring, evaluating, mapping, meeting volunteer teams, music, dance and art.\r\nIn a united Europe students and teachers will greatly benefit from working together with partners from other European countries, thus they can learn to understand and accept other cultures and their traditions. Furthermore, they raise their cultural awareness, broaden their horizon and learn a lot about working on projects in teams, connecting them to school.\r\nWith this project we mainly address to pupils in the age of 14-17 who attend secondary school. At every participating school there will  be a class or group of pupils who will work on the topics with various subject teachers. Besides an own website, where we would like publish our project work for all people, we will also produce  a school magazine to attract people who cannot read about our project in the internet. Through the activities the joy about learning will be supported in a long term way. \r\nThe students involved in the project can use languages, ICT, theatre, cinema, music, photo, arts, culture, local dances,  traditions and local customs, as vehicles for research and to communicate the results of their work.\r\nOur students will be familiar with abstract concepts and will be able to encounter with real problems rather than ready made problems. In this way, they will have the opportunity of learning to deal with uncertainity and making decisons.\r\n Finally, the results of our interaction will reach our schools through products such as  Booklet: religions-similarities and difference and Booklet:How can we reduce racial prejudice and racism?  , a website, exhibitions, ideas for lesson plans, a celebration \"Europe Day\", workshops and presentations.\r\nAt the end of the project a document will be prepared which will identify the proposals to reduce  school drop-out: this document will be sent to the Department of Education and Community policies of the European Parliament.\r\nThe project will be developed through different stages which the schools involved will run simultaneously, with a joint work event at a distance.", "http://ask@bmetc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA219-021928_5"], [2016, "\u201cEquality and human rights\u201d", "Birmingham Metropolitan College", 121944.0, 6, 6, "Schools have a critical role to play in our lives and in the life of the community. As a reflection of wider society, schools are key to socializing younger generations, preparing learners to become active and engaged members of society. In an interconnected and globalized 21st century, young people are being exposed to a diverse and changing world around them, a world in which poverty, inequality and other injustices are still very much a part of the lives of millions.Human rights can give schools around the world a shared language of equality, non-discrimination, inclusion, respect, dignity and participation that is crucial to the goal of achieving a more peaceful and just global society.Our goal is to develop activities, working methods that will build the attitude of openness and tolerance to wide-range differences  to counteract prejudices, xenophobia. Human rights education is a critical means of instilling the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values that can foster a culture of human rights.The project objectives are to sensitize young people on their human rights and the rights of others, increase active participation of young people in society, enhance civic commitment of young people towards human rights protection and promote positive attitudes to the EU vales of human rights and fundamental freedoms thereby fostering a culture where human rights are understood, respected and promoted.Each one of us must educate ourselves about our rights and take responsibility for respecting others\u2019 rights. This is the reason why the partner schools  became interested in how human rights are taught to people.The Partner schools will use the framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child to help students to understand and appreciate common human values. And our project will be guided by the general objectives of the Human Right Convention.A very important another  aspect of the project is preparing a pedagogical base including reflections and proposals of active methods invaluable to improve the Lisbon Key Competences such as: learning to learn, interpersonal, intercultural and social competences, civic competence, cultural expression and communication in the mother tongue. The main target group of this action is students that are the owners of future. That is why all our activities are student oriented and can be only accomplished with their participation. The aim of the these activities is to enable the students gain knowledge and abilities that they can use in future.Our partners represent contrasting social and economic backgrounds, and a diverse collection of communities from across Europe. By working together to deliver our aims about human rights we will be successful in showing our students, parents, staff and others, how people from different parts of Europe can work together in order to improve relations and create a more cohesive European citizenship.  This two year project (2016-2018) outlines key areas of the basic rights and freedoms of all men, women and children.

The project methodolgy is based on the concept of interdisciplinary teaching as a means to enhance the quality of education. We aim at approaching key issues from the perspective of different subjects, cultures and languages, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of civic issues in a European context.

By international \r\nskills we mean courage and initiative of using foreign languages, being aware of cultural differences and ability to solve problematic\r\nsituations caused by them and ability to function in multicultural and global context both in Finland and abroad.  \r\nAlready before implementing Erasmus+ program we have combined our several smaller mobility projects into one common project \r\nfor the whole college's mobility purposes. By doing so we have been able to develop a joint, equal and fair mobility process for both students and staff members and create a cost-efficient mobility operation which meets the needs of all qualifications and  departments of our college. \r\nThe main purpose of the student mobility is to offer to a certain percentenge of our students (the number is defined in our \r\nInternational Plan, which is written yearly under the main strategy of the college) a good quality on-the-job-learning experience in \r\nEurope and to provide the labour market with workforce with good international skills. Student mobility is also seen as a way to \r\nincrease the international skills of those who are staying at home - the whole group can plan the mobilitiy of their classmate \r\ntogether and follow their classmates abroad in social media. We strive to mutual cooperation with our partner colleges, both sending and receiving students.  \r\nThe aim of the staff mobility is to support the student mobility and increase its quality, but also to bring international aspect to the \r\npedagogical developement of the college. The better our staff knows the process of the student mobility and has also experienced it \r\nthemselves by going abroad together with the students, the better they can support their students when they are applying for \r\ngrants and going abroad. From the point of view of developing our organisation and deepening the state of internationalisation \r\nof it, it is essential that the teachers have personal relations with our European partners. Good relations with foreign colleagues also helps in forming strategic partnerships. The number of the grants applied for the staff members is well planned already at the application stage in order to meet the needs and long-term internationalisation plans of each qualification and/or department. Cooperation with working life plays significant role in Esedu's strategy and therefore a part of grants for the staff members are addressed to working life partners. By doing so we want to guarantee that also our international operations serve the working life  and deepen partnerships with companies and other emloyers. Offering our working life partners an opportunity to develop their international skills together with our staff members is also a part of our regional development task. \r\nStaff has an important role also when supporting students when they go abroad. For many of our students the on-the-job-learning\r\nperiod abroad is the first time they go outside the home country, and even for those students who have travelled abroad, the first independent one. We have to take this into consideration when planning and implementing student mobilities.  \r\nOur main value is responsibility and therefore it is very important to develop the student mobility process so that the experience is \r\npositive for the student even in demanding conditions abroad. \r\nWe offer grants for mobilities for all students of our college, both young and adult, and we are mainly sending abroad 2nd and 3rd year students. Our students come mainly from South Savo region, from little towns and villages, and during their basic \r\neducation they haven't necessarily had much contacts with people from different cultural background. They need a chance to \r\nactivate their language skills and gain experience that strengthens their communication skills and multicultural awareness.

With wide partner network we are able to guarantee suitable work placements abroad for every participating student. \r\n\r\nThe participant students are selected so, that all study fields of the college will be represented. We will especially focus on those qualifications that have been earlier underrepresented in student mobilities and offer students of those qualifications possibilities to participate. This promotes equality of all students to acquire international skills and increases the level of internationalization in the whole organization. We pay attention to equal possibilities of students also by encouraging students with special needs to apply for the mobility grants. Almost all student mobilities are practical training in companies or in the business-like study environments at partner colleges.

Workshops on contemporary art media, entrepreneurship in art, and human rights are included too. Four transnational meetings are programmed for the implementation of the artworks, the conduction of students' groups leading to the internalisation of the human values, and the organisation of showcase events in community centres.\r\nMethodology focuses on promotion of creativity, personal initiative, teamwork and cooperation.

Work experience also allows students to take part in innovative initiatives that promote the necessary creativity, the ability to use modern ICT tools, both for their personal growth and their own expertise.

At present, the School is dedicated to the teaching and practice of different studies: Baccalaureate of Arts in Secondary Education but also some artistic vocational studies such as \"Procedures of Gold work and Silver\", \"Artistic Serigraphy\", \"Artistic Ceramics\", \"Artistic Binding\", \"Artistic Gold work and Silver\", \"Cabinet-making Artistic\", \"Moulds and Sculptural Reproductions\", and \"Sculptural Skills\". At the School there is a team of 40 teachers  and about 300 pupils of very heterogeneous sociocultural and economic level as well as different ages, origin and formation.\r\n\r\n2. OBJECTIVES:\r\na) Improve the level of aptitudes and competences of teachers. Encourage education quality and improve the teaching and learning of foreign languages.\r\nb) Introduce a European dimension in the everyday School activities.\r\nc) Encourage the creation of international networks with the aim of future student short and long mobilities.\r\nd) Use the artistic expression as a means for communication, able to go beyond borders. Consider art as an expression tool for the communication of feelings and emotions.\r\ne) Exchange teaching and learning strategies and methodologies with teachers from other countries, spreading results and encouraging collaborative working. \r\nf) Improve the living atmosphere at the School by means of interdisciplinary tasks among departments.\r\ng) Encourage the use of New Technologies in the classroom.\r\n\r\n3. ACTIVITIES:\r\n- 4 training courses for the methodological and linguistic updating of teachers to take place in Italy, Portugal and Ireland.\r\n- 2 job-shadowing stays (one for each academic year of the project). First, in Soares dos Reis School of Art in Porto at the beginning of December in 2018. The second one in Birmingham Metropolitan College in December 2019.\r\nMobilities won't be overlapped. Training courses will be taken in summer holidays to avoid the absence of teachers during schooldays and the difficulties this could cause. Similarly, job-shadowing will coincide with the beginning or the end of a long weekend in December.\r\n\r\n4. METHODOLOGY:\r\nThe first of the two years of the project will focus more on teacher training by means of the four courses and the stay of job-shadowing in Porto. A second stay will take place at the beginning of the second year in Birmingham. In this second year of the project, the knowledge teachers have already acquired throughout the courses and job-shadowing will be transferred as best as possible to Bachillerato students. This second year will be dedicated to the fulfilment of final products.\r\nDuring all the project, a methodology based on \"learning by doing\" will be used. A collaborative working environment will be encouraged. Teachers will bear in mind an active participation in teamwork and the learning process, helping students to develop creativity and critical thinking.\r\n\r\n5. PRODUCTS:\r\nResults will be tangible and intangible. They will be relevant for the improvement of the linguistic and teaching competence, methodological competence, the School management and inclusion. Examples of results will be: audiovisual and multimedia projects, boarding, photography, videomaking, web pages, digital school material, etc.\r\n\r\n6. IMPACT and EUROPEAN VALUE.\r\nThe project will demonstrate clear evidences of being a highly qualified work because it must improve the teaching and learning process; it must be included in students' curriculum and our \"Plan Anual de Centro\"; it must be relevant for the School aims, the rest of educational community and society. The project can be used by other schools in a future so that other students can also take advantage of it. This is why it is so important its widespread among the local press or any other means of communication.\r\nTeachers and students must feel proud of the resulting product.

This project involves 15 students (aged 14/15) and 3 teachers from a specialist performing arts academy in England visiting a specialist dance school in Denmark and the students and staff from the school in Denmark visiting the Academy in turn. The aims of the project are to share good practice in teaching and learning for the staff whilst at the same time allowing students to learn about new cultures and approaches to the discipline of dance. Students will overcome language barriers through the common practical language of dance.  There will be a range of tasks and team activities involved in the project and communication is therefore the key to success.  Students and staff will be involved in the planning and 'getting to know you' activities using E-Twinspace, Skype and social media prior to the start of the project. They will be involved in a preliminary program in order to get to know their Danish counterparts and learn as much as possible before meeting in person and sharing in dance lessons, whilst also delivering peer learning lessons to each other, teaching their own skills and expertise. Teaching staff will undertake a study of how dance is taught at the partner school and share good practice back at their own schools as well as to the wider local, national and international community.  This study will also include the wider application of methodology of teaching and learning in schools.  Whilst on the exchange visit students will participate in lessons, teach each other and younger students dance and experience cultural activities.  The two mobility flows will culminate in a final dance performance involving the community and be filmed for the partner school involving both sets of students.\r\nThe project will result in a greater shared knowledge of different approaches to teaching and learning in dance but also in a wider school context.  For the students the project will widen their vision of both dance education but also develop a cultural awareness of Denmark and in reverse a UK perspective.  Both sets of students will develop in their application of language and develop communication skills.  The project will foster an interest in further international study or career development for both students and staff.  It is also aimed to develop a cultural awareness within the local community through the performance element of the activities.  The findings and video documentation of the project will also provide a catalyst for discussion and further educational developments to a wider national and international audience through online sharing.\r\nProgress will be documented, at all stages, using a dedicated website featuring contributions from both teachers and students involved. This will allow the wider audience for the project to communicate and ask questions at regular intervals through online blog comment opportunities.  The project will also be promoted through social media featuring a dedicated Facebook and Twitter feed to highlight key achievements and signpost a wider audience to the website and more detail on the ingredients of the collaboration. \r\nThe impact will be both direct in terms of the students who experience the opportunity and indirect with those students who experience the performance or learn from their peers about the experience.

Long term this will hopefully improve the teaching and learning in the subject as a whole.
