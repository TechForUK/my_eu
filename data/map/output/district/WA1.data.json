Nozzle sections made from austenitic steel can be susceptible to rapid crack growth due to thermal fatigue and stress corrosion. Early detection of cracks is therefore essential to ensure the continued safe operation of the facility in question.  In order to reduce the time and cost of such inspections there is an urgent need to develop a system capable of performing a full inspection of nozzles without the need to change probes. The aim of NozzleInspect project is to design an autonomous robot system that able to: reduce the inspection times, Improve defect delectability and sizing, Reduce human intervention which will reduce workforce radiation uptake and Reduce requirement for robotic manipulation and consequently reduce size and cost of robotic deployment system.  The goal of NozzleInspect project is to improve the reliability of the inspection of the welded nozzle sections in nuclear and other safety critical facilities. The robot will carry out a new and novel flexible phased array probe to allow a full inspection of nozzle weld areas and an advanced navigation system that follow the weld in nozzle. The presence of defects in these parts could lead to catastrophic component failure.", 232503.0, 1258389.0, "NOZZLEINSPECT", "Nozzle welds checks by robot", "An EU-funded initiative has built an autonomous robot to carry out safety inspections in nuclear reactors.", "Welded steel nozzle sections in nuclear facilities are regularly inspected as they are susceptible to cracking as a result of heat and corrosion. The nozzles form a critical part of the nuclear reactor and therefore detection of cracks is necessary to ensure safe operation of the facility. However, the nozzles are located in an area subject to high levels of ionising radiation and inspection personnel have a very limited amount of time to enter the reactor and set up and calibrate the inspection equipment.\n\nThe 'Autonomous robot for an automatic inspection of nozzle welds in nuclear environment' (http://www.nozzleinspect.eu/ (NOZZLEINSPECT)) project designed a robot for carrying out this vital work. The overall goal was to automate the procedures for calibration and inspection by developing an integrated system that could be carried to the inspection area and easily installed.\n\nProject partners produced a working prototype of the inspection system to help them overcome any technical issues related to the hardware, thereby enabling them to develop the necessary software control and inspection algorithms. The prototype needed to be large, but light enough to be portable and mounted on wheels. In addition, it had to be stable so that it would not topple over when manoeuvring, and rigid enough to resist clamping and other forces.\n\nResearchers developed a new flexible phased-array probe that enabled a full inspection of nozzle weld areas without the need to frequently change ultrasonic probes. In addition, an advanced navigation system was built that used its 3D steering capability to follow the weld around the nozzle, allowing it to be inspected in a single operation. An ultrasonic technique was also developed for inspecting the nozzle weld, as were analytical tools for interpreting large amounts of 3D data.\n\nThe robot will dramatically reduce inspection time and human intervention, thereby saving time and money, increasing reliability and further protecting personnel from radiation uptake. The NOZZLEINSPECT consortium will market the system to potential end users such as operators of nuclear facilities and inspection service companies. The system will therefore help support the nuclear industry and the wider European economy.", "http://www.nozzleinspect.eu", "http://www.phoenixisl.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58297.jpg", "fp7_93485_998136888"], ["4RF", "DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL INSPECTION TECHNIQUES FOR TRAIN AXLES", "Phoenix Inspection Systems Limited", "The structural integrity of wheel sets used in rolling stock is of great importance to the rail industry and its customers. A number of rail accidents have been directly related to the failure of train axles, leading to increased demands for their inspection and maintenance. Visual inspection and Magnetic Particle Inspection are the current standard practices used for manual non-destructive testing of axles. However, these processes require removal of the wheelset from the wagon/locomotive bogie and full disassembly in order to facilitate access.  Inspection is also carried out by some wagon providers using ultrasonic testing (UT) but its application is also limited to disassembled wheelsets.\n\nAn axle on a wheelset can be connected to a number of ancillary components including breaks and bearings. The disassembly (and reassembly) of axles from the wheelsets/wagon bogey is therefore very time consuming and expensive. There is evidence that even partial disassembly and reassembly could introduce future axle reliability problems. To minimise disruption to their train services but ensure continued safety, train operators require frequent and regular inspection methods that allow quick inspection at the depot with the minimum of wheelset and bogie disassembly.\n\nThe AxleInspect project aims to develop new inspection techniques based on phased array ultrasonic and electromagnetic techniques suitable for the inspection of both solid and hollow axles. For solid axles, inspection techniques are to be developed that inspect from the end face of the axles using new and novel phased array ultrasonic inspection technology. For hollow axles, probes based on UT and electromagnetic inspection techniques are to be developed, enabling detection of surface breaking cracks that cannot be found by ultrasonic inspection. These new techniques will allow inspection of axles whilst they are still attached to their supporting bogey, allowing minimal wheelset disassembly from the train.", 240403.0, 1127834.0, "AxleInspect", "Enhancing train axle safety", "New high-tech inspection methods for train axles, which can be employed without removing the axles from wagons, promise to facilitate rail maintenance and enhance safety.", "European trains are becoming faster than ever as rail technology improves \u2014 a trend that is expected to continue over the next 10 years. However, the increased demand on existing rail infrastructure requires increased safety checks and standards, particularly with respect to the structural integrity of wheel sets and axles. Against this backdrop, the EU-funded project 'Development of novel inspection techniques for train axles' (http://www.axleinspect.eu (AXLEINSPECT)) worked on new inspection techniques to improve the safety and security of rail cars.\n\nIn particular, the project team worked on new techniques for solid axles based on phased array inspection technology. It also developed inspection techniques for hollow axles involving probes that exploit ultrasonic and electromagnetic technology. Importantly, the techniques enable axle inspection while the axles are attached to the supporting bogie, saving precious time and resources.\n\nTo achieve its aims, the project team developed sophisticated probes for inspecting inner and outer surface breaking cracks, as well as automated scanners to deploy the probes. It also conceived a scanning jig to conduct the inspection and developed a bespoke data analysis software. The project then designed an innovated phased array probe based on ultrasonic modelling to enhance crack detection capabilities.\n\nOverall, the powerful inspection technology is intended for verifying the structural integrity of train axles in order to improve safety levels. It promises to give Europe a more competitive edge in the field of train inspection, encouraging train use and cost efficiency.

Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.

The above mentioned project includes two different activities matching the two different sections. At a very early stage all students are informed about the possibility of internships abroad. Their interest is also aroused by separate informative meetings held by former interns reporting about their experiences in foreign countries. They get information about current partners of the Berufskolleg Hilden and about organisational and financial aspects. At the same time the existing contacts are carried on to emerge the current data according to supervisors and contact persons. The individual facts are directly given to the participants in order to start a personal contact and relationship to the tutors at an early stage. According to  the section/activity varies the duration of their stay.  In the biotech section the students stay abroad for at least three months and in the IT section the student stay for two months. When beeing abroad a continual contact between the  participants, the tutors  and coordinators  in Hilden is secured. In addition to that a personal visit of the teachers in charge is effected. In the end the Training Agreement and the Europass will be worked out and signed mutually. All students write an internship report which is proof read and evaluated by their teachers. These reports offer an insight into the increase of language, professional skills and experiences, as well as into social and intercultural competences of the students. Furthermore the reports as well as presentations are used for evaluation. Posters and presentations function as a tool for spreading the results. Moreover organisations and other interested parties are informed by these activities in order to establish the Berufskolleg Hilden as School of Europe (Europaschule) focussing on the major target of internationality.", "http://www.warrington.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002067_8"], ["4LS", "Green Learning Environments \u2013 Taking advantage of the stimulants in green environments for non-formal learning with children with mental disabilities and learning disorders", "Green Lane Community Special School", 271607.0, "This project taps into the stimulants provided by green environments for facilitating non-formal learning. We will collect and peer review good practices that use parks, nature and woods as green learning environments, and more specific for the target group of children between 8 and 14 years with mental and/or mixed impairments and/or learning disorders. Research suggests this target group takes even more advantage of the green environment for non-formal learning and basic and transversal skill development. The aims of the project are (1) to increase the awareness on the stimulants in nature to facilitate non-formal learning, (2) to collect and review existing practices for non-formal learning in Green Learning Environments with the target group, and (3) developing, testing and disseminating a toolbox.Our multinational, interdisciplinary project team comprises four green partners experienced in education in green areas, and six specialised schools for children with special needs, from Slovenia, the UK and Belgium. Through exchanging and peer reviewing existing practices within the participating organisations and other organisations within and beyond the project countries, we will build a database of and report on good practices for Green Learning Environments (Output O1). Based on this review, we will develop 12 educational materials, methods and tools to be included in the Green Learning Environments Toolbox (Output O2). Three country teams will develop the Toolbox, each team including a green partner and the specialised schools. The materials will be tested in one of the other schools involved in the project, and reviewed by the project team. The joint work on the Good Practices Database & Report and the Green Learning Environments Toolbox will lead to joint capacity building with the project partners. Finally, we will compile a Policy Brief (Output O3), stating the advantages of Green Learning Environments for children in general and our target group more specific. The Policy Brief will also include a brief summary of the project and will introduce the materials and outputs developed.The project will involve 125 children with special needs from 6 schools, and 175 staff members from these schools. We will communicate widely and give a lot of attention towards disseminating the results and tools provided by the project through social media, newsletters, articles in local and specialised press, conferences, mailing lists, ... (expected audience: at least 2000). The project will be closed by a Concluding Seminar, which will be held concurrently in the three countries involved (expected attendance: 55 national participants and 15 international participants each) (Multiplier Events E1, E2 & E3). To stimulate interaction between the 3 concurring seminars, we will set up video-conferencing; online streaming (and recording) the conferences makes it possible to expand the audience to people attending online during, or after the conferences. The Policy Brief will be sent out to relevant local, regional, national and European administrations, authorities, expert networks, umbrella organisations, politicians and policy-makers (over 125 addressees expected). In total we will reach over 2600 people.Apart from the results during the project, we aim at leaving a legacy trough the Green Learning Environments Toolbox, which will be widely promoted and will be freely available online, also after the end of the project, and trough the Policy Brief. We are assured that the project will lead to an increased awareness on the advantages of green areas for formal and non-formal learning. We are assured the Toolbox will stimulate schools and organisations to go outdoors for learning, leading to increased learning outcomes, and eventually to a better inclusion of the target group in society.", "http://green-lane.eschools.co.uk/website", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE02-KA201-017373_9"], ["1UH", "Music Exchange and Cultural Learning Alliance", "Warrington Borough Council", 267149.0, "The  MECLA Project  (Music Exchange and Cultural Learning Alliance) will enable trilateral partnership  between England, the Czech Republic and Denmark and the dissemination of key skills involving the delivery of Music education to children and young people from the age of 7 - 11 years.  There is a need for Accent MEH to address progression and legacy programmes and a need for the Czech Republic and Danish partners to build links with local primary schools, through the establishment of a tuition programme modelled on the English National Curriculum and English Whole Class Vocal and Instrumental Tuition Strategy. Through the participation by key colleagues in a reciprocal visit to Warrington and Nachod in 2016, and the strength of the current partnership between Charanga and Denmark, it has been identified that each partner has a great deal to learn from the practices of the other, and that the development of these practices will have the impact to be realised locally, regionally,nationally and internationally.\r\nThe project will involve primary age children and we will track progress over 3 years. Accent  MEH will study the way in which children in Nachod learn Music Theory and Musicianship and transpose this into a new Music IT Programme which will be commissioned by Charanga (a nationally recognised  English company in the field of digital Music education) for use in Warrington, Halton  and Nachod  and Danish classrooms.\r\nCzech colleagues from our partner organisation (Arts School Police nad Metuji) will learn the fundamental pedagogy linked to the successful delivery of Music tuition to whole classes of children, and link with 1 regional primary schools in order to devise a teaching programme, which will track musically gifted and talented children and generally raise standards in the delivery of Music education.\r\nIt is hoped that outcomes will lead to children being able to articulate their thoughts about Music both verbally and through writing / appraising, which will lead to increased standards in the use of English in both countries. English children aren\u2019t exposed to the Czech language or culture and we hope to address this by incorporating folk songs and nationalist compositions into the project. In addition, we would want to promote British Values in both countries and encourage mutual respect and citizenship.\r\nBoth partner countries wish to promote new materials in a modern, dynamic setting, which will be tailored to the needs of pupils, and will allow colleagues to link and share good practice. This will mean investment (practically and philosophically)in a different way of delivering Music education on a daily basis and a pledge to make sustainable changes in both countries which will be disseminated to a wider community.\r\nWe aim to address the need for strategic training of dedicated staff over the course of the project and to all for reflection and monitoring in order to realise the best outcomes. This will happen through annual conferences and interim contact via digital forums.", "http://www.accentmusiceducationhub.co.uk", "Warrington Borough Council", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036782_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA1"}
