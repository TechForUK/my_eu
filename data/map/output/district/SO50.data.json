The project complies with HPS\u2018s long-term policy regarding foreign internships (strengthening extant collaborations and further broadening of the host organization network) and with the ideas HPS holds concerning high quality professional internships. \r\nThe project follows previous successful projects, but it also responds to the current needs of the students/instructors at HPS. The feedback is performed through internal questionnaires, multi-level discussion (student/graduate-instructor-school management), in regular instruction, staff meetings and student assemblies. The school uses the EURES platform and organizes special seminars focused on foreign internships and/or employment opportunities on foreign labour markets. The school thus maintains its competitiveness with universities and thereby its attractiveness for future applicants. Another expected effect is broadening of the graduates\u2019 career opportunities, which is expedited by their acquisition of comprehensible European documents (Europass-Mobility, Europass-Diploma Supplement, Europass-CV) and the adoption of ECVET, which is a guarantee of quality for the potential employers. Simultaneously, general awareness about the school is spread through successful graduates, which helps its search for new professional partners. A secondary effect of the steady offer of foreign internships is high motivation for current students.\r\nSelected participants represent all departments at the HPS, i.e. Conservation and Restoration of Furniture and Non-polychromed Woodcarving, C&R of Painting and Decorative Techniques, C&R of Ceramics and Fashion and Textile Design. This concerns the second/third year students (6), graduates (14), teaching staff (6) and school management (1). Graduates are unfortunately rarely the target group of grant programmes, although it is them who attest to the qualities of their school the most. The education, however, would lose its purpose should the graduates fail to find work in their field. The support should thus be readily available in the most vulnerable stage of their career development, which is why their number is relatively high compared to the day students. \r\n\r\nThe content of the professional internships for C&R students/graduates corresponds with clearly defined units of learning outcomes for each separate department; i.e. the participant will examine, document, propose a restoration treatment and restore the assigned object. The student/graduate of the Department of Fashion and Textile Design will design an article of clothing based on the assigned criteria, justifying his/her choices, and realize it. Staff and management members will fulfil the obligatory Work Programme (job shadowing, exchange of expertise, practical work internship). All participants will also improve their language skills (some of them in two languages \u2013 in case they reach the B2 level in the main communication language, c.f.

Little attention has so far been paid to the roles and competences of people who carry out assessment, yet this can present barriers to recognition when crediting learning abroad.

The stakeholders will have the opportunity to report on the status quo regarding assessment and assessor requirements in their countries, it will also be possible for them to express their views concerning the current conditions and requirements, highlighting any issues and identifying the potential for improvement and change. \r\n\r\nThe project outcomes are to include a comparative analysis of current requirements, as well as an online catalogue of the different member states' requirements with specific case studies highlighted to give examples of good practice. It is envisioned that the project results will lead to an enhanced understanding of assessor training and requirements in order to support increased mutual trust between VET systems. Ultimately, this should improve the standards of assessment in VET and the ability of competent bodies to validate and recognise assessment carried out outside the \u2018home\u2019 system and support the increased implementation of ECVET and mobility of VET learners in the EU.", "http://www.vtct.org.uk", "ECCTIS LIMITED", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013777_5"]]}}}}
