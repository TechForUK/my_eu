The objectives of this project are to determine how food nutrition labelling can affect dietary choices, consumer habits and food-related health issues by developing and applying an interpretation framework incorporating both the label and other factors/influences. Based on this, guidelines will be developed on use of nutrition labelling for EU policy and the food industry, especially SMEs, which will include recommendations for assessing the impact of ongoing and future legislative and voluntary food labelling schemes. These objectives will be achieved by a work programme covering an analysis of current penetration of and exposure to nutrition labels in the EU, determinants of attention to and reading of nutrition labels, determinants of consumer liking of nutrition labels, understanding how consumers infer healthiness of food products from label information in combination with other sources, in-store use of labels, and effects of label use on dietary intake. The project will draw heavily on the involvement of stakeholders from the whole food sector to ensure results with high practical relevance.", 35832.0, 3212063.0, "FLABEL", "Nutrition labelling for improved food choices", "EU funding has supported a group of researchers in their quest to better understand how food labelling impacts European consumers and their dietary choices.", "Nutrition labels can potentially steer consumers into make healthier food choices. However, current insights into how consumers use nutrition labels in actual shopping situations are limited, making the science-based formulation of new labelling policies and the evaluation of existing ones a difficult task.\n\nThe 'Food labeling to advance better education for life' (FLABEL) project explored the interplay of environmental factors, personal factors and characteristics of the food label itself to explain the role of nutrition label information in making food choices and the resulting impact on dietary intake.\u00a0Project efforts showed that the availability of nutrition information on food products is very high in Europe. Findings note that the majority (85%) of food packages have some nutrition information on the back of the pack and nearly half (48%) have nutrition information on the front.\u00a0It was also found that consumers can understand the information presented and have no problems using it to rank products according to good health promotion.\n\nNotably, study results highlight that lack of motivation and attention are significant bottlenecks, preventing nutrition labelling from positively influencing consumer choices. Researchers found that too little attention is given to nutrition labels for the information to be meaningfully processed. Findings showed that consumers need to be motivated (e.g. have a health goal) to pay greater attention to nutrition labels and engage with the supplied information.\n\nAccording to FLABEL, to increase consumers' attention to and use of nutrition labels, the best way is to provide information on key nutrients and energy on the front of the pack in a consistent manner. Using a health logo to complement this information could also increase attention and use.\n\nInsights gained from FLABEL research results can help EU policy and the food industry develop guidelines regarding the use of nutrition labelling. Policy implications that have been discussed with different stakeholders include considering nutrition labelling in a broader context, standardising guidelines on its use as well as regarding the information as a major incentive for product reformulation and innovation.", "http://www.flabel.org", null, "/docs/results/images/2011-02/55835.jpg", "fp7_88399_999558326"], ["7TF", "TRADECOM: Trader communication, collaboration and compliance system", "Speakerbus Technology Limited", "In the proposed project, TRADECOM: Trader communication, collaboration and compliance system, the project partners will develop and validate innovative hardware and software solutions to meet the communication, collaboration and compliance needs of financial services, energy and commodity trading and brokerage markets.\n\nThe TRADECOM project partners will design and develop a new desktop communication endpoint (known as a trader turret) that will provide traders and brokers with high-quality, instant, private and secure group communications using intuitive user interfaces. The partners will also develop and implement necessary backend communication and media services to enable scalable, resilient and compliant call routing and recording via the internet and cloud services. The project will introduce new middleware that will link trader turrets to corporate computer systems, enabling turret functions to be accessed from enterprise applications (e.g. click-to-dial) and application data to be accessed from the turret (e.g. contacts and call groups). This will provide traders with more efficient ways to manage communications and workflow between the turret and other desktop systems. The TRADECOM turret will be designed to interoperate with Speakerbus\u2019 emerging virtual turret (vTurret) services, which will replicate the TRADECOM trader communication services on desk and mobile devices. This will enable traders to work away from their main TRADECOM turret and still access specialist voice and data communication services. An important focus of the project will be to pilot and demonstrate the integrated TRADECOM systems in real operational environments and to assess the impact for traders and trading organisations.
