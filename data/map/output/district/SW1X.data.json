We have started our work with successive European research projects in the last years by starting with the development of a drive-by-wire platform, but the combustion engine is still a drawback. eFuture wants to prepare the next generation of electric vehicle based on our first prototype by creating a platform which minimises its energy needs but can still optimise dynamically its decision between safety and energy efficiency. Our key issues will be the optimisation of this energy usage and its influence on the vehicle/driver.We have already seen that optimising each component separately is not enough, an overall concept is mandatory to look at the interactions between the components. The strategies to control the actuators will be integrated for safety issues, comfort driving and energy efficiency and the management of the transitions between these controllers. Second ADAS functions will be re-worked to manage these different aspects and a decision unit will base on the proposed time horizon to pre-compensate the transition between modes for energy optimisation. Beside the technical developments, a major aim of the project is to look at the driver who will be confronted with dynamical properties as this energy management will have a high impact on driving.At the end eFuture will be ready with a static (right configuration of components) and a dynamic (software based synchronization of command and execution layer) optimisations. Transitions between different vehicle behaviours (safety, performance, efficiency) will be designed and a strategy set for the priorities in terms of energy needs during requests collision will be developed. In addition the acceptance of the driver to this dynamical behaviour will be investigated.", 568973.0, 5885410.0, "eFuture", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95487_985803920"], ["8PG", "Prevalence, 1-year incidence and symptom severity of mental disorders in the elderly: Relationship to impairment, functioning (ICF) and service utilisation", "Royal College of Psychiatrists", "Reliable data on the prevalence and incidence of the spectrum of mental disorders in older people are currently lacking for the EU. Despite the availability of some national and a few cross-national cross-sectional studies with quite variable results, the size and burden of mental disorders in the elderly remains unclear. This has been attributed to a number of methodological factors (e.g. lack of appropriate diagnostic instruments). In addition patterns of incidence and of the natural course and prognosis of mental and physical disorders in people above 65 years are lacking nationally and cross-nationally in the EU, with only a few notable exceptions. Furthermore, there are no cross-national studies investigating the interaction of mental disorders and the utilisation of treatment under specific consideration of the severity and the impairment of activities and participation, in terms of ICF-categories, of older people in different European countries. Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to (1) develop, respectively to adapt existing instruments and (2) to collect data on the prevalence, the incidence and on the natural course and prognosis of mental disorders, and to do this in sufficiently powered representative samples of older people living in the community across different European countries. This includes assessing health service needs, investigating to what extent existing services are used by older people and which specific barriers to utilisation may exist. Thereby, the implementation of the study will enable the further development and improvement of harmonised instruments for the assessment of impairments of activities and participation in older adults, to adapt already existing instruments, and to facilitate results that are comparable across cultures.

The first involved a comprehensive effort to adapt an assessment instrument for the elderly. The new instrument, CIDI65+, was not as long, broken down into shorter sub-sets of questions, and was combined with section-specific sensitisation questions. The instrument was then pilot tested with 55 subjects, aged 60 to 79 years, to determine its reliability.

In the fourth stage, a sample of 2\u00a0368 participants tested during the third stage were reassessed to examine the 1-year incidence rate. \n\nResults from the third stage found that nearly half of the sample suffered from a mental disorder in their lifetime, nearly one third had experienced psychological symptoms within the last year and nearly one quarter were currently experiencing a mental disorder. Prevalence rates were higher than those found in other epidemiological studies. At the same time, mental health services were underutilised, pointing to the need for strategies to educate communities about available interventions. \n\nThe 1-year follow-up study with 2\u00a0368 subjects found that new incidences of mental disorders also occur in old age.
