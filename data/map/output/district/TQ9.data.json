This is a problem since as societies become more complex, increasing scope and unpredictability of potential crises and faster dynamics of major incidents put increasingly stringent demands on CM. European CM capabilities already constitute a mature System of Systems; hence wholesale redesign would often be too costly and might critically destabilise existing CM capabilities. Therefore DRIVER\\ focuses on augmenting rather than replacing existing capabilities. DRIVER\\ has three main objectives: 1) Develop a pan-European Test-bed for crisis management capability development; 2) Develop a well-balanced comprehensive portfolio of crisis management solutions, and 3) Facilitate a shared understanding of crisis management across Europe.\n\nThe DRIVER\\ Test-bed will provide the technological infrastructure, the necessary supporting methodology and adequate support tools. The Portfolio of Solutions (PoS) is a database driven web site that documents all the available DRIVER\\ solutions. The PoS includes information on the experiences with a solution (i.e. results and outcomes of trials), the needs it addresses, the type of practitioner organisations that have used it, the regulatory conditions that apply, societal impact consideration, a glossary, and the design of the trials. Initially, the PoS will contain information about the solutions that are already available within the consortium; the PoS will be extended with third-party solutions when required by the trials, and ultimately opened up for any external organisation to share data and experiences on solutions.\n\nA series of trials will be conducted during which solutions will be operationalised and tested. All results of the trials will be stored and made available in the PoS. Several I4CM events will be organized as well as a final conference. In addition to this, a firm link is established and will be maintained with DG HOME\u2019s \u201cCommunity of Users on Secure, Safe and Resilient Societies\u201d and other European stakeholder groups and relevant initiatives, for instance on standardization.\n\nTo maximise impact beyond the scope of the project and of the DRIVER\\ consortium it is necessary to develop the sustainability of the European Test-bed, the exploitation of the DRIVER Portfolio of Solutions and to promote a European CM community, which shares a common CM understanding and is increasingly willing to share capabilities and collaborate in CM innovation. Together this will boost Europe\u2019s ability to continue adapting to new threats and emerging needs, laying the basis for a continuously resilient EU and providing a mechanism to drive innovation in European CM by bridging the gap from practitioners need and R&D to the market.", 306092.0, 36008950.0, "DRIVER+", null, null, null, null, "http://www.disasterwaste.org", null, "fp7_188608_952266849"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5SG", "Mobilit\u00e4t w\u00e4hrend der Lehre", "S.E.L.S.A.C.S. ltd", 95633.0, "This project shall contribute that the beneficiaries acquire additional practice knowledge in the context of their dual vocational training or after the final examination which is for the further career path of importance.

Participants gain confidence in using technology through practical sessions which equip them with ideas and materials that they can use upon their return to their own country. They will take part in seminars, workshops, lectures, open discussions and a study visit  (training and enterprise organization) and places of cultural interest.\r\n\r\n\u2022 One teacher of vocational subjects will attend English language training course for vocational teachers - a blended approach. This course is for those teachers who are working in vocational or technical secondary education. The training will focus on improving participants\u2019 confidence in English as well as furnishing them with the skills necessary for better vocational teaching. Foreign language competences are essential for the formation of a working team on international projects in the center.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ten trainee students, who completed their training at the center not later than 2 years before the date of the start of the mobility and who have not found work employment in the given field yet will be able to take a 14-day practical training in the UK.

This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners.

In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. The project proposal will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES and FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities. The project intends to have a significant impact on public and private key actors of the partners\u2019 countries and the respective national, regional, local.  The project contributes to enhance partners\u2019 national VET systems through:\r\n\r\n- the promotion of internationalisation and mobility strategies, linked with the quality assurance systems for placements, monitoring contents and recognition of skills acquired  abroad;\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the quality in VET also significantly contributing to the further development of the competence of staff organising mobility as well as teachers, trainers and tutors involved. The EU added value of the project is, furthermore, the support provided to the implementation of common EU tools and methods for mobility quality assurance. for the implementation of an effective ECVET system for comparability and portability of VET qualifications in full compliance with EQF principles.

Furthermore, European reality consists of multiplicity of local economies, initiatives and small enterprises. We believe the future - which deeply concerns young people - will reinforce the local, especially its capacity of sustainable development and fruitful collaboration.

Perhaps part of the problem is the lack of understanding of what really motivates students. According to sociological studies, the current school environment has a poor setting for the professional work and it often seems to work against the teachers' best efforts to grow professionally and improve student learning.\r\nTeachers' attitude is crucial to the success of in-depth curricular innovation.\r\nA \"radical rethinking\" of professional development encouraging teachers' growth has to be done. Teachers must have the opportunities to try out new practices by taking new roles and creating a culture of inquiry. The staff development also means \"providing occasions for teachers to reflect crtically on their practice and to fashion new knowledge and beliefs about content, pedagogy and learnes\".\r\nMotivation is optimized when the person is engaged in the task for his own reason rather than in response to external pressure, the task must be of appropriate level of challenge and there must be a sufficient choice.\r\nResearch has shown that good teaching practices can do more to offset student indifference than extraordinary efforts to attack motivation directly. Most students react positively to a well-organized lesson taught by an enthusiastic and motivated teacher who has an authentic interest in students and what they are learning. This in order to generate an atmosphere that is open and positive. It is increasingly evident that the educational methods we have been using for the past 70 years are no longer sufficient. Teachers are used to taking part in several training courses specific fo their subject and they are at local, regional or national level. They new something new and with a high impact in their professioal development. for this reason we have decided to apply for individual mobility under Erasmus plus programme. The ais is focused on the transfer, improvement and update of competences and of innovative methods and practices in the field of education.\r\nthe project promotes transnational cooperation in the field of multilingual curricular education and training so as to promote the transfer of specific competencies and the dissemination of up-to-date teaching methodologies targeted to the specific didactic contexts of CLIL (content and language integrated learning) approaches. It also aims at facilitating and increasing teachers'mobility, which holds out the prospect of a stronger European dimension to teaching, and improving the quality of education and training systems through the adoption of innovative solutions which may grant the students up-to date training withe reference to the skills and competencies required by the European labor market.\r\nThe needs of the participans are to improve the professional and linguistc skills and to be trained in the innovative methodologies in teaching with CLIL methodology.

Most students react positively to a well-organized lesson taught by an enthusiastic and motivated teacher who has an authentic interest in students and what they are learning.

New emerging competencies and learning concepts, also taking into account the needs of microenterprises are required by both sectors: the traditional simple and repetitive tasks are evolved to multidisciplinary tasks in order to deliver more complex products and services.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools.

They will be more qualified to get jobs and more suited to keep them or to carry on with their studies.Their circle of friends and professional contacts will be expanded and will help them to open doors in Europe and beyond.

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourism, competent language skills in English, Italian and French as well as a focus on services management and international communication is a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. Part of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks in the college and 24 weeks in the tourism school. In the past two years the interest of both the students and graduates of the two schools in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.With this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. Additionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and a number of young people (including students and  apprentices of the area) have contacted us with the wish to get more information about it. The news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.Currently 35 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.  Besides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. The experience of the last years has shown us that our trainees start their practical training abroad as teenages and finish it as young adults. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.Due to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.lovingthebeach.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016396_6"], ["7LQ", "TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2016", "The Venus Company Ltd.", 195524.0, "\"TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2016\" -  \u201eTyroleans on the Road 2016\u201cThe project objective is to promote the transfer of Tyrolean students in vocational education and Tyrolean apprentices to European companies, offering them possibilities to gain work experience and to improve language skills.

Our objectives are linked to the following three themes : 1. EUROPEAN CITIZENSHIP, AWARENESS AND DEMOCRACY:. To develop amongst our students a feeling of belonging to the European Union ;. To discover another culture, to contribute to social cohesion ;. To discover and learn different working techniques and how other businesses function ;. To create a network of contacts in the host country ;. To give a modern and European dimension to our teaching mission.2. TEACHING AND LEARNING FOREIGN LANGUAGES:. To give a sense of learning a \u2018living\u2019 language and to deepen the students\u2019 linguistic competence in preparation for their future career ;.  To support the school's non-linguistic teaching staff to learn English.3. REGIONAL EXTENT AND COOPERATION :. To create a network of partners linked with our vocational subjects for both our regional sector and that of the collaborating country ;. To cooperate with a sector which exports the label \u201cBistrot Beaujolais\u201d abroad ;. To reinforce cooperation between the world of education and the world of work ;. To create a recruitment pool of qualified young people who have the capacity to respond to the expectations of regional businesses and therefore to develop their employability.Our project is spread across 24 months.

To select the participants, we have established a very precise list of criteria.The job-shadowing will take place during the first months of the school year in order to allow us to disseminate and use the knowledge and skills acquired with our learners and within the school.Our partner organisation selects host families as well as businesses, resolves problems of discipline and adaptation to the country and monitors the work experience of each student. It coordinates a week of vocational English classes. It will host two of our learners.The work experience abroad will be preceded and followed by internal or external activities at the school in liaison with partners in the area.

Taking into accounts these aims, the \u201cCenni-Marconi\u201d Istitute has developed the \u201cEX-CHANGE - Enhance language exchange for professional development of educational staff\" project that aims to promote the mobility of 35 teachers who work in the Institute and mainly or specialized in the teaching of English or in specialist areas such as tourism, marketing, finance, accounting.\r\nEX-CHANGE  goals are:\r\n- Promote a mobility project for members of the Institute teaching staff. The project will offer the chance to meet and talk to other foreign colleagues, exchange ideas and practices, and strengthen key competences such as foreign language skills; digital knowledge applied on tourist marketing (structure course); update of specialized knowledge such as accounting, finance and building sector; and tourism (by job shadowing activities);\r\n-             Improve the methodology to approach to school/work alternation; \r\n- Facilitate the adaptation and modernization of the Institute with the acquisition of new teaching methodologies, kits and tools already implemented in an European context that can be adapted to local school needs and to the main school courses, such as Marketing and Finance and Engineering, Environment and Territory;\r\n- Strengthen, on an European level , the existing and new relations amongst higher education institutes and businesses in order to develop joint activities and collaborations, such as mobility and teaching staff, students and newly graduates training;\r\n- Experience intercultural contexts to improve teaching skills which take into account students\u2019 different needs, with a specific focus on disadvantaged situations experienced by the children of refugees attending the Institute;\r\n- Inform the colleagues not involved in the project of the European existing opportunities, and  launch a new information service that will be called \u201cSportello Europa\u201d.\r\nThe mobility program will allow 35 participants to attend two mobility experiences. Candidates should be:\r\n- foreign language teachers or teachers with a technical expertise in the two main courses of the institute (marketing, finance, accounting, tourist hospitality, building, environment and territory); \r\nThe project activities will last two weeks. There will be an intensive English course, followed by a job-shadowing activity to be delivered in Ireland at Swan Training Institute to develop structured courses in English language and courses in tourism marketing, and in the United Kingdom at The Language in Group for the implementation of job-shadowing activities.\r\n The methodology developed by the partnership follows the main division of the activities into key phases, namely the preparatory phase (with the selection of participants and practical organization of the mobility); the implementation of the mobility and the follow-up phase together with the validation of the results and learning outcomes achieved, and the final launch of the \u201cSportello Europa\u201d service.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the general improvement of linguistic skills, and communicative and management skills, with a greater awareness of cultural diversity which occasions of enrichment will bring a renewed spirit of collaboration with foreign partners.\r\nIn terms of results and impact, an overall improvement of the educational offer and of the services of the institutes is expected, thanks to the use of innovative approaches in teaching activities that combine teamwork and use of new technologies in class. \r\nOn a long-term perspective, a modernized teaching system will have a positive impact on students education and will make them develop essential skills for the challenging job market.

At present the city administration of Bonn trains 180 people for 22 professions.\r\n\r\nThe study visits take place in five European cities. The highly experienced and reliable EU project partners from  Austria, Finland, Italy, Macedonia and the United Kingdom offer specific learning and work related training programs for municipal and vocational training contents. The qualifications, skills and experiences is provided during the study visits by training, lectures, discussions, themed and group-based team elaborations, visits.  Furthermore there are active, supervised and accompanying collaborations in the respective departments of the partner administrations. The participants will acquire new methods within their vocational fields and a foreign system of vocational training and learn how to work with colleagues from foreign cultural backgrounds. As a result of EurOpen, new competences and experiences can be implemented in their own home and partner city administration. By this means the participants\u2019 employability and the attractiveness of training for a job in the public sector will be increased. \r\n\r\nWithin the city administration of Bonn, the study visits in the cities of Graz, Skopje, Totnes, Turku and Vicenza are complemented by intercultural and linguistic trainings.\r\n\r\nThe city of Bonn has been awarded as a \u201cEuropaaktive Kommune\u201d (approximately: city actively promoting the idea of Europe) by the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.", "http://www.languageingroup.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004092_5"], ["5SG", "Praktik- og Sprogophold", "S.E.L.S.A.C.S. ltd", 95488.0, "UCH is located in a sparsely populated area of Denmark , which is characterized by small industrial compagnies and the trade .

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.\r\n\r\nDue to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.lovingthebeach.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034653_8"], ["7LQ", "TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2017", "The Venus Company Ltd.", 316627.0, "\"TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2017\" -  \u201eTyroleans on the Road 2017\u201c\r\n\r\nThe project objective is to promote the transfer of Tyrolean students in vocational education and Tyrolean apprentices to European companies, offering them possibilities to gain work experience and to improve language skills.

The multilateral Comeniusproject Eurobacdiploma, coordinated by the RRB, developed a certificate of excellence named \"European Business Baccalaureate Diploma\" (\"EBBD\") with 8 different elements harmonised throughout Europe. One of these elements is the work placement abroad.\r\n\r\nProject objectives\r\n\r\nThe learners should gain practical work experience in a company abroad, develop professional and intercultural competence and improve their foreign language skills. The acquired knowledge should enhance their employability in international companies as well as their mobility and enable them to European, entrepreneurial thinking. The participants should actively participate in their life, working and learning environment  in a European country and reinforce their European identity.\r\n\r\nBy testing the use of various ECVET elements  developed in the \"EBBD\" project and by using the instruments / certificates Euro Pass mobility, the Euro pass CV and the Euro Language Passport the efficiency and quality, the Europe-wide transparency and recognition of the placement abroad in to the training should be increased. \r\n\r\nThe partners involved should further develop their quality standards in the context of the project objectives, exploit synergies and thereby possibly increase their competitiveness and their project financing options.\r\n\r\nNumber of participants\r\n\r\nThe total number of participants over the 24-month project period is 34 learners. The internships are planned as a 4-week activity in a company in a partner's country. The internship period is firmly anchored in the annual agenda of the commercial college. In 2019 and 2020 17 learners at any one time will complete the internship (three weeks  in school time and  the first week of their Easter holidays). \r\n\r\nDescription of activities and procedures for project implementation \r\n\r\nBefore starting the project the RRB concludes  partners partnership agreements in which, inter alia, learning areas / competences and fields of action and the procedures for evaluation, documentation, validation and recognition are agreed. After the selection of applicants these go through an organizational, educational, cultural, and task-related preparation. The learning agreement is concluded. Concrete learning outcomes / competences are formulated. At the end of the internship, the results are evaluated with an appraisal form (criteria-based interview) by the mentor and the participant. \r\n\r\nAfter returning the internship is reflected by the participants. Using assessment results the Euro pass mobility is issued. The trainees  write their professional thesis and create their Euro Language Passport. The project will be evaluated by the participants and accompanying partners during the project and at its end and disseminated.\r\n\r\nDescription of the expected results and effects and the expected long-term benefits\r\n\r\nThe project enhances the employability, enables them  to study at a European university and encourages them to move to different European countries. This effect is supported by obtaining the instruments recognized throughout Europe such as  Europass CV, Europass Mobility  and Europass Language Passport. The participants act internationally, Europe grows  together for them. Their European identity is strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe RRB is locally and in the region the only vocational college that offers this Europe-wide harmonized additional qualification (work placement in connection with EBBD).

The school practice takes place at the partner institutions mentioned in the application, while the business practice will take place in a preselected company that matches the individual student's needs and wishes for professional work-related learning. Each student prepares, in cooperation with the student's contact teacher / teacher, the ERASMUS + LEARNING AGREEMENT FOR VET MOBILITY. This entails the UCH's partner institution, which is then tasked with matching the content with a local company in that country in collaboration with UCH's project department.\r\nAll students will be offered OLS before and after their mobility stays.\r\nFor EUV students whose stay will be of a long-term nature (1-3 months), business agreements will be concluded that the stay forms part of their internship.\r\nFor some EDU students in the 2nd school period, there may be a 14 day stay in Slovenia at a hotel and restaurant school that UCH has also had mutual exchanges with. The 14th day in Slovenia will alternate between internships at hotels and school classes. UCH's international EUD coordinator seeks this implemented, which means that the Slovenian partner will be included in the project later.\r\nUCH's employee mobility and cooperation plan for the teachers and leaders in this project includes internship and job shadowing for 12 teachers, with 4 in Spain, 4 in England and 4 in Germany. The teachers and leaders will collaborate with the partners mentioned in the application on the organization of a 5 day internship and job shadow course in both technical vocational training institutions and merit education institutions in the three listed countries (the institutions will be: South Devon College, UK, The Institute Technology and Education (ITB), University of Bremen and Valencia Business School - no fee payable). In connection with this 5-day course, the teachers and leaders will screen and discuss the parts of the European Development Plan (EDP) listed in Section D point. 4th subparagraphs a, b and c. This course will qualify the EDP and ensure a European record for the interdisciplinary aforementioned, which is intended to be conducted at UCH, which will support UCH's internationalization and pave the way for a strategic partnership project between the countries.\r\nThe international department initiates the following\r\n1) By screening all Learning Agreements we will measure whether the goals set have been reached \r\n2) By reviewing the Mobility Tools evaluations we will be able to deduce whether the mobility stay has been instructive.\r\n3) By doing before and after the test in OLS, we can also measure whether the students are language based better after the stay.\r\n4) Staff Mobility - will be measured continuously - using process and self-assessment.", "http://wwww.totneseuropeanschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DK01-KA102-046907_1"], ["5SG", "ERDI-HEZIKETA 2018", "S.E.L.S.A.C.S. ltd", 78650.0, "This proposal \u201cErdi Heziketa 2018\u201d is aimed at 22 young students, of Initial Vocational Training of 33 professional training center located in the Basque Country. \r\n\r\nThis new proposal includes the following partners:\r\n\r\n-Confebask as proposal's oordinator.\r\n-Vocational training schools included on the consortium, both public and private, belonging to the Training Network of Centres of the Basque Country, as sending institutions.\r\n- The Department of Education of the Basque Government, Provincial Councils as Institutional and co-financiers partners.\r\n- Intermediary partners and Host organizations in Italy, Portugal and the UK.\r\n\r\nThe objectives and expected results are the achievement of meeting the following needs of the participants covered by this proposal: \r\n- Improvement of practical training, in addition to theoretical training gained during their training period in their centers. Provide participants with practical training through the 3 months-stay in businesses in Italy, Portugal or the UK, thus enabling the Technician qualification through recognition of the stay by the form of Training at Work or FCT. These stays will be developed between March and June 2019. \r\n- Improvement of their language skills: Learning and/or improvement of one or more languages (Italian / Portuguese / English): general knowledge and technical information relating to their professional field.\r\n- Improvement of Professional Skills: Participants acquire skills and abilities terminals set in the training program placement module, which enable them to carry out their profession. Development of a set of capabilities or skills necessary for incorporation into the workforce.\r\n- Improvement of Cultural and Personal Skills: It is, in many cases, the first experience and stay abroad, which implies personal maturity. To live in a multicultural environment, involves the acquisition of a spirit of adaptation to different social-cultural as well as a huge cultural enrichment. \r\n- Promote and encourage VET innovation and internationalization.\r\n\r\nConfebask has been participating for over 15 years in European mobility projects, with a baggage accumulated over 1600 participants so that vocational students are concerned.

Through this website, the training centers send to Confebask their students-candidates. It is performed the selection of participants, and especially, becomes the key to monitoring and mentoring of the stages, once started stays abroad. Also, this tool is essential for economic management of the project itself led by the coordinator.\r\nConfebask as project coordinator, will support in its initial phase (October 2018 - February 2019) including supporting sending partners and their tutors, selecting participants and identifying skills to be developed in host companies.\r\nDuring the stay in the country of destination (March-June 2018) you will be monitored and supported by an intermediary partner/ host organisation,  who will manage the participants\u2019 accommodation and arrvial support, and who will perform direct follow-up work through a methodology defined by Confebask as \u201cLearning to Learn\u201d.

With this application we plan to send apprentices in the dual system (13) (office management clerks, retailers, warehouse workers as well as industrial clerks and wholesalers acquiring the additional certificate \u201eEuropean Merchant\u201c) and students in full-time classes at the BBZ (19) (commercial assistants, nursing staff assistants, assistants to social education workers) for 3- to 5-weeks internships abroad (Belgium [3], Denmark [2], Great Britain [20], Austria [7]). As intended in our strategy for international development, the internships enable our  students to realize general differences in professional training as well as differences in business routines and company culture. Furthermore, the apprentices\u2018 professional and intercultural competences are boosted. In many cases this also applies to their command of English. \r\nLast but not least the apprentices\u2018 flexibility and self confidence concerning the ability to handle situations even in a foreign country cannot be emphasized strongly enough. For the assistants to social education workers the milestones for a workplacement abroad (duration, requirements) have been agreed upon in the BBZ. Enquires to several project partners are under way. We expect that we can arrange internships for 3 trainees in kindergartens etc in England. We are still trying to convince some apprentices from the engineering sector to do an internship. No matter how hard we try, it is still very complicated and time-consuming. Nevertheless, we are quite convinced that we will be successful in sending two engineering apprentices to complete an internship abroad arranged by our partner in Austria. Unfortunately, a renewal of the internship project program for hairdressers is still not in sight. Fortunately, we get a slightly but constantly growing number of applications for long-term internships from students for their first year after graduating. Like in 2017 seven future  commercial clerks want to do a several-months-internship in Ireland (6x6 months, 1x4 months). Additionally, there is 1 office management clerk who applies for Denmark (4 months) and a industrial mechanic for an internship in England (52 weeks). Especially with the underage trainees it obviously is necessary to have them accompanied by a teacher during the first days abroad. \r\nThe teacher serves as a kind of reassurance-back-up in case a difficulty arises. Afterwards the apprentices are supervised by our project partners abroad. Before the internships all particpants, students and staff are well-informed (cultural aspects, dress code, language). When they return, a feedback will be given by them to us. In order to constantly improve the quality of our organisational and administrative work, we also ask our project partners and the apprentices\u2018 companies for a feedback. As far as the staff mobilities are concerned we perceive a growing interest in the mobilities \u2013 also with colleagues not being members of the BBZ Europe-Project-Group. Apart from mobilities with a direct relation to the teachers\u2018 subjects (economics, nursing profession, social education, foreign languages) there are also colleagues who take an interest in congresses that concentrate on digitalisation in education and its consequences e. g. for teaching methods. Due to long-term relationships to partner organizations/schools a skype-based exchange \u2013 comparable to e-twinning - between groups of students has been initialized. So it is possible to exchange experiences in the classroom  in a more realistic way. Whether expansions into fields like the coproduction of goods  is realizable is being looked into. In the caring section an intensified exchange has been initialized between the BBZ and  our project partner in Belgium (German speaking community). Topics that will be dealt with are e.g. the different caring concepts and structure of the students' training. Here staff mobilities help to experience what otherwise can only be talked about theoretically. After having returned, all participants of mobilities will contribute to enhance the readiness for cooperation on a European level. They might do this in conversations with their colleagues and bosses or by giving reports about their experiences abroad on our website or the local media. The Europass-certificates are handed to each participant in a suitable ceremony at the end of each year.", "http://www.languageingroup.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004673_4"], ["5RZ", "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION", "Language in Totnes Ltd", 318396.0, "SMART CAREERS PROMOTION represents the ideal continuation and expansion of the previous edition of WORKSTAR project. The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented. The commitment continues:\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of language training and certification courses in various languages (participation in the MOVE 5.0 projects financed by the ESF Veneto Region);\r\n- in the promotion of CLIL methodology and job shadowing activities abroad (ETwinning)\r\n- in the upgrading and improvement of hosting services\r\n- in the implementation of tools for the management of all phases of mobility\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of cultural exchanges and stays abroad also through the consolidation of European networks", "http://www.languageingroup.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006482_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ9"}
