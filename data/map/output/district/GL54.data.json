A promotion of the project is planned in all VET schools in order to allow everyone to share their results and experiences. To promote the project, public events take place most of the time, leading the largest number of people to know more about the impact of this project.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training.

As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2.

The development is part of the infrastructure program of EU - with focus on transport and communication. In order to meet the demands of this labour market we need to educate the students and give them an education with the conditions and qualifications they need for a road into higher studies and a way into the European employment market. \r\nDue to that we have a need to prevent early withdrawals from school and encourage students to complete their education and deepen their language and literacy skills, expand their mathematical capacities and entrepreneurial learning. Entrepreneurial learning, sustainable development and internationalisation will be a natural part in the education and result in an upgraded education making the students ready to meet the demands and qualifications that a future society requires from its citizens. It is important that our students graduate with a high level of education and are well prepared for further studies and working life.  Coincidently we acknowledge a need to update and develop the educators\u2019 knowledge and didactics, get new co-operations within the schools, with the local commercial industrial life and the municipality of Varberg.  We also need to develop our contacts with organisations and schools outside of Sweden.  Therefore we will participate in different courses that meet our needs in our development plan regarding ICT in school, STEAM, Math and language skills, entrepreneurship, and sustainable development from a global perspective.

This application is part of a long-term and on-going process to reach the goals on a local as well as on a global level. In the long term our efforts will lead to a better education, increased literacy and language skills, better mathematical skills, an understanding of the transnational society, an understanding in how to develop a sustainable future and an increased employability. In the short term will the teachers\u2019 increased knowledge result in better teaching methods,make more studeents choose higher courses in mathematics, give the students opportunities to achieve better result, more students will fulfill their education and be better prepared for further studies. This work will be part of our daily routine both in short and in the long run. All our activities will be impregnated by a formative approach where the learners will be participating in their own learning process. Activities such as: reading and literacy projects, entrepreneurial learning, mathematical projects and sustainable developmen with special focus on Circular Economy. The internationalisation will make us advance quicker with trends that already have been proven useful in other places. Increased mobility means references that we can share and develop in our schools but and in the municipality. Accordingly with the general goals of EU2020 are we emphasising entrepreneurship in all kind of education to increase the quality and the results in our educations. This project will prevent early withdrawal, increase the employability, give improved language skills, European Citizenship,  entrepreneurial learning and sustainable development.  The elementary focus will be that our developing activities are high-quality work for everyone. Not only the participating teacher (mobilities) are able to participate in the activities/development. Everyone will be given an opportunity to implement and develop the new knowledge.

The aim is focused on the transfer, improvement and update of competences and of innovative methods and practices in the field of education.\r\nThe project promotes transnational cooperation in the field of multilingual curricular education and training so as to promote the transfer of specific competencies and the dissemination of up-to-date teaching methodologies targeted to the specific didactic contexts of CLIL (content and language integrated learning) approaches. It also aims at facilitating and increasing teachers'mobility, which holds out the prospect of a stronger European Dimension to teaching, and improving the quality of education and training systems through the adoption of innovative solutions which may grant the students up-to date training withe reference to the skills and competencies required by the European labor market.\r\nThe needs of the participans are to improve the professional and linguistc skills and to be trained in the innovative methodologies in teaching with CLIL methodology. During their mobility the teachers will do job shadowing or teaching assisgments in schools to understand the Educational System of the foreign countries and to improve their knowledge about the different teaching methodologies. \r\nThe relevance of the project for the professional and personal development of teachers is the possibility to tke part in a mobility action, with all the accompanying measures needed to improve the necessary skills to work successfully in the knowledge society.\r\nThe participants will be involved in the dissemination and implementation of the results an in guidance at local level in schools.

The project TIICEE aims at renovating the pedagogy in our school because we have to admit that too many pupils aren't interested in learning any more and we, teachers, find really difficult to motivate them. We need to teach differently and they need to learn differently too. We have listed our priorities: first we think that it is vital to widen their intercultural approach so that they can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Then we think that the pupils must use the ITC tools intelligently and properly. Finally we need to develop the \"working together\", the autonomy, the creativity and the choice-making process in all the teenagers so that they can find a good job. A group of 6 teachers and a member of staff have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The structured courses with school visits (\"job shadowing\") are meant to observe and understand new and innovating teaching practices in countries such as Iceland, Finland or Ireland. Other training sessions are more specialized and concern the science teacher, the sports teacher, drama techniques  and ITC tools. Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality is also planned. The teachers  will implement these new teaching techniques but also take part in new European partnerships and projects.

We have 320 pupils. 12 members of staff of which 8 secondary school teachers, 2 primary teachers and 2 members of the administrative staff have decided to get involved in the project.\r\nRESPECT OF EACH PERSON AND OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nTwo priorities have been identified. First, the staff of our school (teachers, educational staff, administrative staff, the Principal) has noticed that our students  coming from very heteregoneous backgrounds don't necessarily show respect to their classmates, the staff members, the material or the premises. \r\nWe welcome in our boarding schools at any time during the year new students due to social, educational, financial or other motives   Some students also leave us during the year for the same reasons. It is our duty to welcome them in our institution as best we can, to enable them to trust us, to help them like school, the place where they can get the best preparation for their future professional life.  Respect towards each person  must be shown so that our students feel good at school. A renovated, active and personalized policy of welcoming everybody, trying to understand everyone, whether be it when they first arrive or during their stay with us is vital.  The project WOW aims at welcoming everyone in our school in the respect of his/her past taking his/her weaknesses and strenghts into account.  A positive and tolerant atmosphere will enable our students to concentrate on school. Our second priority is to open the school towards the outside world: the town, the charities in our region and the parents. We want to open the doors of our school and work with them for a better understanding of each other. Finally we think that it is vital to widen our intercultural approach so that our students can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Focus on foreign language is then essential.\r\nTRAINING SESSIONS FOR A PERSONALIZED APPROACH AND OPPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nA group of 12 staff members have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The courses dealing with Multiple Intelligences, preventing bullying, Hidden Talent in your classroom or Inclusive teaching were chosen to help us understand how we can better work wih our students.  Partnership with the outside world will be achieved through a training session about the way to discover the city and observation in a finnish school. Other training sessions concern languages (English, German and italian) to show that interculturality is really important to us.  Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality in the European projects is also planned. These training sessions will enable us to achieve our goals of accepting everyone in a respectful atmosphere, reducing the school dropout and widening our cultural horizon. \r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe first training sessions focus on languages (English, Spanish, German and Italian) so that the following courses are attended without linguistic apprehension. Follow the courses about inclusive education, hidden talent in the classroom, anti-bullying or multiple intelligences. The other partners in the project (parents, students, teachers) will be asked their opinion through surveys so we can adjust our project. The whole staff will be informed through meetings. (for the teachers every 6 week and for the rest of the staff twice a year). \r\nIMPACT\r\nFor our students, the impact will be seen through a renewed involvement in school, a better self-esteem and  trust towards other but also with better relational, intercultural and academic skills. The teachers will manage their classes in a different way for a better teaching and learning. For our school the impact will be a new positive and committed image in the large communities of parents, mayor, members of our Foundation and  the academic authorities of Alsace.\r\nBENEFIT\r\nThe benefits can be from a personal point of view for our students, staff members  but are also institutional.

After analysis of the questionnaires and taking into account our teachers\u2019 opinions, we made a diagnosis of our possibilities and stated that changes are needed.Our response is the project entitled \u201dSchool of success \u2013 a creative and innovative teacher\u201d, where we described methods for modernising and a positive change in the quality of our work.The project is related to:- implementation of our school\u2019s European Development Plan,- extensive cooperation with institutions from whole Europe,- improving results of teaching and education.In order to achieve this aim dependably prepared teachers are needed. The conducted survey revealed poor command of English among 90% of our teachers and insufficient ICT skills. We are aware that they are essential in advanced process of teaching. These are the reasons why we want to offer courses for 19 teachers in our project.OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT ARE:- to provide language skills for our teachers in order to enable them to participate in European programmes for training and educating the youth. Good command of English will enable them to participate in implementation of eTwinning projects, mobilities to other countries as parts of \u201dErasmus+\u201d strategic partnerships projects and international exchanges,- to prepare our teachers to teach their school subjects in a bilingual class which we intend to introduce,- to use ICT and effective methods while teaching school subjects in class,- to use the opportunities given by interactive whiteboards, e-learning platform and eTwinning projects in the process of teaching,- to support didactics by using tablets and iPads during lessons,- to show the teachers that learning can be efficient and attractive,- to overcome cultural barriers and fear.DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES; PROFILES AND NUMBER OF TEACHERS:- methodical and language course to prepare for teaching in a CLIL class \u2013 6 teachers (3 scientific subjects teachers, 3 humanities teachers) who will use Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) in their work. Teachers with command of English on B1 level.- course on the use of interactive whiteboards \u2013 3 teachers who need help in this field.- course on the use of ICT during lessons \u2013 3 teachers whose lessons are not attractive for students (on a basis of questionnaire for the students).- course on the use of tablets and iPads during lessons \u2013 2 teachers who are innovative and as a consequence, will train other teachers.- course on the use and operation of e-learning platform \u2013 2 teachers. Their task will be to administer our school e-learning platform and to support teachers while creating teaching materials which will be used by students after school.- course on implementation of eTwinning projects at school \u2013 3 teachers. The participants will be teachers who are willing to implement eTwinning project in the process of teaching.METHODOLOGY OF ACTIVITIES:The project will be based on the following methods:- surveys- brainstorming (defining an objective, splitting duties, range of activities)Courses abroad will consist of:- lectures- workshops- seminars- discussionsSHORT- AND LONG-TERM RESULTS:- increase in language competence of all participants- increase in the number of mobilities connected with \u201dErasmus+\u201d projects and international exchanges- acquisition of skills which are needed to use interactive whiteboards to create our own teaching materials properly- increase in ability to use eTwinning projects in everyday work with students- raising the level of knowledge about other cultures and countries and openness to search for international contacts- acquisition of interpersonal skills - acquisition of skills needed to transfer knowledge efficiently in a bilingual class- increase in external examination results which are obtained by our graduates by 5 per cent starting from the school year 2016/2017.ANTICIPATED IMPACT AND BENEFITS:- raising the prestige of the school- promotion of the school in our town and county - motivating the teachers to change educational reality by using European Union projects- encouraging talented young people to become students of our school.In conclusion, we want to achieve the increase in quality, attractiveness and efficiency of teaching in our junior high school. All these means are supposed to encourage the potential students who are curious about the world to become students of our school. The means will also enable graduates of our school to continue their education in the best senior high schools.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA101-023693_5"], [2017, "J'enseigne \"europ\u00e9en\" en Martinique", "International Study Programmes", 27538.0, 3, 3, "The Lyc\u00e9e polyvalent Nord Atlantique (LPO Nord atlantique) is a high school in Sainte-Marie with 455 students ranging from ages 15-20. Located in a rural region of northern Martinique, Sainte- Marie is a town with roughly 18,000 inhabitants. Due to the disadvantaged nature of the region and high unemployment, few students have the opportunity to travel, whether for work, vacation, or sporting competitions. \r\nCreole is the local language, but various foreign languages are studied in high school, such as: English, Spanish, and Portuguese. \r\nOpening the high school to external locations in Europe and other countries globally is a major objective for the educational community. The opening of a European section would make this objective feasible. The headmaster has already requested this for two years.  The school is already involved with exchanges and partnerships with foreign institutions, however the priority has been given to the students..\r\nThis project aims at offering opportunities of mobility to form the school staff. The project will develop the teachers\u2019 social, professional, language, and intercultural skills. They will make this development possible by observing work situations, discovering new learning methods, and exchanging practices with local teachers and European colleagues. Teachers will also be able to develop, enrich, and reinforce their language skills through total immersion in a foreign country. Regarding the managerial staff, the project focuses on enhancing and developing managerial and linguistic skills. \r\nThe project includes six teachers, including four language teachers (English and Spanish), as well as the Dean of Students on behalf of the administration. \r\nThe main activities revolve around courses aimed at improving teaching practices and communication skills. Participants will also visit institutions of the chosen country to better understand the country\u2019s school system. One key aspect of the trainings will be the sharing of practices and ideas among European staff (teachers, heads of staff, Dean Of Students etc). \r\nFollowing this, it will be expected for teachers to utilize the new working methods acquired during the trainings to spark students\u2019 curiosity and motivation for the subjects. This will revitalize the teaching team by fostering multidisciplinary work teams, as well as awakening teachers\u2019 motivation in their own subject matters and profession more generally. This will require the development of trainings in their schools and the academy. Locally, the school will be able to benefit from increased support and participation of other local institutions and businesses. \r\nIn the long term this mobility should promote the desire to go on trainings for staff as well as  the promotion of an European class within the school among the teachers and the pupils.\r\nThanks to the construction of long-lasting relationships with partner countries and other European teachers, it will be possible to set up new KA1 partnerships for teachers and students.

experience  that was never proposed to them during their previous experience.\r\n \r\nThus, as has been  the case  since 2001, our pupils of Vocational highschool  have had the chance   to benefit from a professional and personal  practice thanks to the  Erasmus + program,  in various countries or English-speaking regions of the European Community: Ireland, England, Wales.\r\n \r\nEach of these experiences has straightened and reinforced our motivation to apply, year after year, for the Erasmus + Program   because we are conscious of the increasing importance of an occupational integration of the pupils within the European community.\r\n \r\nBesides, the personal fulfillment from which they benefit in the aftermath to their experience remains the most visible impact when we meet them later, as  grown-ups, when they come back  to tell us their professionnal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nSo, in a systematic way, our teaching staff seeks , after each experience abroad, to know precisely the opinions and the impressions of our pupils.\r\nThrough the questionnaires which are handed to the pupils as well as to the tutors, we are able to correct, improve and  develop our future mobilities.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn the same way, we are eager to consider the remarks of the assessors of the National Agency, as mentioned in their report at the time when the grants are allocated.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our will to widen the offer of training has led us to open the European Section to a new  section (Administrative Management), in 2013.\r\nIn 2014, fifteen pupils of these two classes had the opportunity to benefit from a mobility in the United Kingdom ( Gloucester) between March and April.\r\nWe plan for this mobility open to Spain and to benefit the students in our trade chain, and open up for them a European section marked \" Spanish\".\r\n \r\nAs in our previous mobilities, an intermediate partner in the host country is recommanded: the latter will, indeed, allow to facilitate the database for possible companies to employ our candidates and host families  in adequacy to the profile of the participants.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the stay abroad will include, according to our wishes, an accommodation in host families and an internship of 4 weeks in a company.\r\n\r\nOur participants arising from varied and mainly modest socio-cultural backgrounds, we noticed that the European mobility through the Erasmus +program, establishes, for these pupils whose school experience  is fragile, a real added value: concrete, recognized and source of appreciation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards the main objectives for our participants, they will be as followed:\r\n- To improve their level of English, their communicational skills as well as their linguistic experiences in a working environment as in everyday life and/or family life.\r\n- To open to other lifestyles and become integrated into a culture which is strange to theirs.\r\n\r\nWe have the ambition to think that this mobility will allow them to exceed the limits of the national systems and to thrive on  ways of lives  which are not familiar to them, that is why we encourage  the largest number to participate in this project and  put into practice their know-how, as well as their manners, abroad.\r\nBy this way , they also can apply for the European Mention as well as EUROPRO and EUROPASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two diplomas soon become assets for our participants but also for their furture employers. \r\n\r\nAlso, these experiences abroad proved in the past that they were an undeniable springboard between highschool and the higher education, so much so as the aquired self-confidence opens to unexplored perspectives .\r\n\r\nFinally, this project will also facilitate the adaptation to the requirements of the working world, what makes of this experience an asset.\r\n\r\nOur objectives aim to be, above all, realistic and operational, always in adequacy with the expectations and skills of our various partners.\r\n\r\nOur\"post-mobility\"work  allows us a systematic improvement, having determined the needs and possible breaches in our previous experiences.\r\n\r\nOur Highschool is recognized today to have led the European projects for more than ten years since we never fail to promote our mobilities and to mention their success.",

Except providing business education in Slovak language, from the school year 2015/2016 the school opened a new field of study - business academy - bilingual study (Slovak-English). That is why it is necessary to get enough applicants for this study program. Our school would like to provide the students high-class education with qualified teachers. This is not possible without taking part in this project. Except providing the legal minimum, that means teaching at least three vocational subjects in English, our teachers are ready and willing to teach also other vocational and general subjects in English language.Aims of the project: The main aim of this project is to ensure the quality of bilingual education at school. Our school wants to become a prestigious school within the \u017dilina region and keep its proficiency by having qualified teachers with enough skills, competences, new ideas and experiences to ensure the  success of this field of study. Promotion, publicity and dissemination of the project achievements belong to the essential targets.Participants\u00b4profiles and their number: 11 teachers of both general and vocational subjects will take part in various courses enabling them to teach such subjects expertly. The selection of the courses has been done effectively and logigaly so as to set up the education in bilingual section with the greatest effort. The course \"Teaching business English\" is important mainly because of ensuring the way how to teach business English; the course \"Collegiality across Clil\" is necessary especially besause it is crucial to set up the cooperation among the English teachers and the teachers of theroretical and practical vocational subjects; the course \"CLIL is necessary because we have to cover the education of other general subjects in English language; the cources \"Teachers of English in vocational schools and Teachers in vocational schools\" are important for teaching English for vocational purposes and finally the course \"School development and quality evaluation \" give the principalship the ability to participate actively on the project. Methodology: particular activities of the project are planned in a logical order, chronologically, in accordance with the realisation of the courses; beginning with the selection of the participants upon pre-set criteria. Intercultural preparation will be ensured by the coordinator with the cooperation with an English lecturer. Organisational preparation will be managed by the coordinator with thecooperation with the partners. Monitoring of the project is its crucial part.Activities: Taking part in mobilities would give the teachers a great opportunity to use new  technologies for teaching English, make use of the software program Moodle, blended learning, create presentations, adopt business phrases, plan their lessons effectively, analyse and classify individual tasks, bring new study materials, exchange their experiences with other teachers. The project will help to set up the cooperation between the teachers of vocational subjects and general subjects in the bilingual section. The teachers as well as the principalship will have the opportunity to participate and observe relevant teaching lessons. The comparison between the Slovak and English educational systems could be  a great challenge for all the teachers to bring new methods, imagination and creativity into the teaching process. For the the teachers of English language it is a way how to become effective English teachers with using new methods, techniques, presentations, new words and phrases and how to motivate students by using various interesting activities. For the teachers of  vocational subjects it is a way how  to learn to teach English for the vocational purposes. For the principalship this project could be an opportuninty to exchange experiences and develop relations with directors from other European countries, practice their communication skills, get a different view how to solve various problematic situations at school. Results, impact and advantages: Undoubtably this project will have an impact not only on the participants themselves but it will have an impact on  all employees and students of the school. Taking into consideration that in the \u017dilina region there are a lot of foreign companies and institutions seeking for employess with language, communication and business skills, thanks to the project the school will have graduates ready for the labour market. The rate of unemployment will be lower. The implementation of this project will ensure our school success not only in the present days but especially in the future. The project will certainly have a positive effect not only on our school, but on other schools  within the \u017dilina region.

The low income doesn\u2019t allow students to travel abroad, giving them poor skills in the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROJECT\r\n\r\nThe project comes from the desire, that we have, to bring our students to Europe and to improve their English skills. This goal can be achieved by giving, to teachers, competences and methodologies about the CLIL joined to skills within the framework of Erasmus+ actions. Since knowledge makes collaboration easier, the project aims to provide administrative and accounting knowledge around Erasmus+ framework to the administrative staff of the school. This action will improve its collaboration with teachers that undertake one of the Erasmus+ actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals it is necessary to raise awareness and then train the teaching and administrative personnel. We will set up a group of 10 teachers, two for each of the four branches  of the Technical school and two teachers belonging to Lyceum. Each pair will consist of teachers that steadily teach technical subjects at school. Alternatively, the pair could be formed by a teacher of technical subjects and one that teaches scientific or humanistic subjects. Two units, belonging to the school\u2019s administrative staff, will complete the team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe twelve members of the group will attend courses, according to their skills. These courses will be addressed to improve language skills or competences in CLIL or competences in Erasmus+ framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe qualified teachers team will ensure to reach all the users of the school. The two units belonging to the administrative staff will act as facilitators for teachers during the new projects\u2019 designing phase. \r\n\r\nThe team, composed by members with different skills, will be organized in a mesh. It will be the flywheel of future activities of the school in the field of student mobility and action KA2 already scheduled in the immediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPACT\r\n\r\nAll the school\u2019s teaching staff will be reached by the trained teachers group\u2019s expertise so that the design of the future Erasmus+ actions and the school's activities itself, will take on, over time, scientific characteristics that in the past have often been absent bringing about, as consequences, severe and gross errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n LONG TERM BENEFITS\r\n\r\nThe quality of European projects will improve and it will be possible to implement actions, such as student mobility that, to be addressed, requires a responsive and trained class council. This will bring to the internationalization of the school, with obvious benefits for the cultural and relational aspects of outgoing students. They, also thanks to their improved English skills, will be able to better face their careers or their university studies.", "http://International-Study-Programmes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA101-000946_4"], [2014, "Utilizarea limbii engleze - factor de performanta in educatie", "International Study Programmes", 21023.0, 2, 3, "The European Programmes designed for developing and improving English language for the teachers of all disciplines bring their undeniably consistent and coherent contribution to the promotion of a vast European experience in teaching providing the partners with a wide range of updated and efficient holistic approaches to the educational system offering the opportunity to exchange information and experiences for the benefit of learners of all generations.\r\n     An empowering and reinforced personal and professional dimension together with renewed teaching competences and attitudes will successfully lead to obviously higher standards of training and teaching.
