The project is a continuation of successful local and international trainings organized by SEAL CYPRUS to promote Entrepreneurship among the youth. In February 2016, 4.381 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU-28. High youth unemployment rates do reflect the difficulties faced by young people in finding jobs, especially females and youth with disabilities.At the same time there is a lesser appetite for entrepreneurship in Europe compared with our main competitors. Only 37% of the EU citizens prefer to be self-employed or an entrepreneur to being an employee (51% in USA and 56% in China) according to the DG for Enterprise and Industry. OBJECTIVES Main aim:To improve competences linked to the professional profiles of Youth Workers, Youth Trainers and Youth Leaders with an emphasis on the Key-Competence of \u201cSense of Initiative and Entrepreneurship\u201d.Objectives:A. To develop key skills and competences of Youth Workers, Youth Trainers and Youth Leaders in Non-formal Entrepreneurship Education andB. To reinforce the capacity and international scope of organisations active in the youth field to promote Entrepreneurship with educational activities and initiatives to address the needs of young people.  NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThe training is going to bring together 30 participants from 10 countries-Cyprus, Albania, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Lithuania, Slovakia, United Kingdom and Ukraine.Participants of this project are Youth Workers, Youth Leaders, and Youth Trainers active in the youth field and willing to build their skills and capacity to develop quality initiatives and educational activities to promote entrepreneurship. They all have diverse backgrounds and levels of experience in the field of entrepreneurship. Priority will be given to people who hold a disability status, to those who are as registered as unemployed in their Public Employment Service and to those who have low income based on their income-tax return certificate. We know that 5 of the participants are going to be people with disabilities. (More detailed description has been provided in part E. Participants' Profile). ACTIVITIES & METHODS The project includes the 7-day training course and 10 days for personal learning commitments, peer learning, online work, etc. We will use:-Non-formal participatory methods (team building activities, energisers; world caf\u00e9, live library, case studies, brainstorming, \u201cspeed-dating\u201d with successful entrepreneurs, presentations, info-sessions, simulation games, reflection groups, buddy system etc);-Learning by doing;-Learning by experience;-Improvisation theater;-Creative learning (through drawing, textiles, photography, music, etc.);-Mentoring, to support participants to develop their project ideas and guide them in their further learning journey.RESULTS AND IMPACT Participants are going to improve their skills and competences certified with Youthpass.The training will develop and broaden the understanding of entrepreneurship, its dimensions and relations with the labour market. Participants of the training will be able to support their organisations in addressing unemployment and promoting entrepreneurship.The presence of 5 people with disabilities in this training will have an enormous impact on the participants and will empower many young people. This project ARTrepreneurship is going to have an important impact beyond the participants. Through their involvement, the people involved in all the phases either as project managers, staff members, board members or volunteers will develop a wide range of leadership and management skills.Partner organisations are expected to extend the international dimension of their work, to learn about non-formal methods of entrepreneurial education, to strengthen their relationships with their stakeholders. The training will provide an opportunity to establish sustainable partnerships for further cooperation and projects.As a result of this project, the participants and their organisations will be prepared to encourage entrepreneurship among youth in an efficient way, as well as to organise quality projects within Erasmus+ Program of the European Union and beyond.On the long run the project will bring benefits to communities, which participants are coming from, as well as an international community, since after the training participants are going to implement transnational initiatives based on the network of organisations which became a part of the training.", "http://www.silverfoxne.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-CY02-KA105-000783_5"], ["5ND", "Youth for Project management", "Silver Fox North East CIC", 12503.0, "\u201cYouth\u00a0Project\u00a0Management\u201d\u00a0Youth\u00a0Exchange\u00a0will\u00a0bring\u00a0together \u00a0youngsters\u00a0aged\u00a0between\u00a016\u201025\u00a0years\u00a0old\u00a0t o\u00a0explore\u00a0and\u00a0master\u00a0their\u00a0project\u00a0management\u00a0skills\u00a0to\u00a0form\u00a0a\u00a0base\u00a0for\u00a0further\u00a0active\u00a0engagement\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0 communities.\u00a0Participants\u00a0are\u00a0youngsters\u00a0from EU 29 countries\u00a0willing\u00a0to\u00a0improve\u00a0their\u00a0project\u00a0management,\u00a0motivated\u00a0to\u00a0get\u00a0actively\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0communities\u00a0through\u00a0implementation\u00a0of\u00a0local\u00a0initiatives.\u00a0During\u00a0the\u00a0week\u00a0(5\u201011\u00a0February\u00a02017)\u00a0participants\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0guided\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0learning\u00a0journey\u00a0to\u00a0develop\u00a0their\u00a0skills\u00a0and\u00a0competences\u00a0and\u00a0improve\u00a0basic\u00a0knowledge\u00a0on\u00a0project\u00a0management.\u00a0Their\u00a0ideas\u00a0and\u00a0concepts\u00a0will\u00a0gradually\u00a0take\u00a0shape\u00a0up\u00a0until\u00a0the\u00a0point\u00a0where\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0transformed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cEuropean\u00a0City\u00a0Quest\u201d.\u00a0The\u00a0project\u00a0has\u00a0the\u00a0following\u00a0objectives\u00a0at\u00a0its\u00a0core: \u2010 Increase\u00a0the\u00a0ability\u00a0to\u00a0project\u00a0management;\u00a0 \u2010 Develop\u00a0confidence\u00a0and\u00a0leadership\u00a0skills\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0\u00a0learn\u00a0how\u00a0to\u00a0work\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0team\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0implement\u00a0an\u00a0initiative; \u2010 Develop\u00a0the\u00a0sense\u00a0of\u00a0critical\u00a0assessment\u00a0of\u00a0initiatives\u00a0young\u00a0people\u00a0organise,\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0\u00a0learning\u00a0from\u00a0failures\u00a0and\u00a0challenges; \u2010 Increase\u00a0the\u00a0sense\u00a0of\u00a0initiative\u00a0and\u00a0entrepreneurship; \u2010 Develop\u00a0social\u00a0and\u00a0civic\u00a0competences\u00a0through\u00a0cooperation\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0local\u00a0community\u00a0and\u00a0stakeholders; \u2010 Increase\u00a0the\u00a0sense\u00a0of\u00a0initiative\u00a0and\u00a0active\u00a0European\u00a0citizenship; \u2010 Develop\u00a0understanding\u00a0and\u00a0appreciation\u00a0of\u00a0European\u00a0values\u00a0and\u00a0cultures\u00a0through\u00a0sharing\u00a0and\u00a0exchange;During\u00a0the\u00a0exchange\u00a0the\u00a0diversity\u00a0of\u00a0methods\u00a0of\u00a0non\u2010formal\u00a0education\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0used:\u00a0simulation\u00a0games;\u00a0discussions;\u00a0role\u2010plays;\u00a0theater;\u00a0presentations;\u00a0brainstorming;\u00a0world\u00a0cafe;\u00a0open\u00a0space;\u00a0live\u00a0library;\u00a0group\u00a0work;\u00a0team\u00a0building;\u00a0youthpass;\u00a0etc.After\u00a0the\u00a0exchange\u00a0participants\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0encouraged\u00a0to\u00a0carry\u00a0out\u00a0their\u00a0initiatives\u00a0in\u00a0participating\u00a0countries\u00a0(implementing\u00a0the\u00a0local\u00a0\u201cEuropean\u00a0City\u00a0Quests\u201d)\u00a0involving\u00a0more\u00a0youngsters\u00a0in\u00a0organisation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0event\u00a0at\u00a0local\u00a0level.", "http://www.silverfoxne.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-NL02-KA105-001393_2"], ["5ND", "Camera.

Thanks to the effort of NaturKultur e.V. and Leppe\u00acGanespalte Foreningen in Langfjord. The Youth Exchange deals with negative developments in the globalized chain of food producers, food processing enterprises and the final consumers.  The exchange aims to to raise awareness among youth to improve their consciousness for good food, its origins and a responsible ecological behavior of all of us, that will lead to a healthier lifestyle.Nowadays the largest share of world\u2019s population participates in a global cycle of production, trade, processing and consumption of food. This food is not any more consumed, where it has been produced nor does it reach the end consumer in a raw form. In our global world imported food replaces local food, convenience food and eating out replaces home-cooked food, fast food replaces slow food. Even worse, large quantities of food produced actually never reaches the consumer. Due to distorted consumer demands - especially in our Western World - it is sorted out and thrown away. Food decays during transport and storage or it is taken out of stores due to over-regulated shelf-life prescriptions. Interests of international food conglomerates to sell cheaper products with higher profits lead to the gradual degradation of food. The growth of food is industrialized in plantations, older more healthy races are replaced by genetically modified sorts. Cattle is subjected to inhumane treatment. Mono-cultures become a danger for nature\u2019s sustainability. Food items are redesigned. Its contents are replaced by cheaper products. Artificial spices, colors,  salt, etc. are used to create taste and looks where there are none. Sugar is added to spur hunger for more. Chemicals are added to prolong shelf-life. But there is also a growing awareness that such developments lead to higher obesity, increased allergies, destroys nature and deprives local and smaller farmers of good profits. Movements springing up everywhere in the world attempt to stop that development and to increase consumer awareness. They do not stop short there, but actively change their own and others behaviors. There is a movement for fair production prices for third world farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers switching to ecological farming, permaculture, biodynamic farming. There are urban gardeners growing food in their cities. There are the adherents of aquaponics, growing vegetables and raising fish in leftover industrial plantations or even on rooftops. There are those reshaping distribution channels by marketing homegrown food directly into households or from ecological farms into farmers\u2019 markets in the cities. There are also those, who are recycling allegedly \u2018bad\u2019 food sorted out before passing the farm gate or in the wholesale markets. There are even people diving into the dumpsters of supermarkets. There are those who are attempting to provide cheaper and better food through the evasion of packaging, the exchange of industrial food sorts against traditional, more healthy and more valuable ones. We design this follow up youth exchange to introduce a large group of participants to the situation, its outlooks and possibilities to act themselves. They will learn from each other about developments in their countries. They will study the importance of transport, storage, sorting, packaging and positioning to influence their consumer behaviors. The will be visiting farmers, wholesale markets, supermarkets to inquire and discover themselves the mechanism of price and production. They will train themselves to read, study, understand and analyze the prescriptions of food. They will attempt to design an own youth-friendly diet by buying, tasting and by cooking food together. We will experience in person the difference between industrial farming and ecological farming. They will be helped by activists, researchers and inspection services. We want this Youth Exchange to be one of several, through which youth workers can learn from youth, how it is possible to mobilize and train young people of their age to become more aware and receptive to a more pleasing food diet, that instantly reduces the ecological \u2018food\u2019 print of generations to come.

On this stage we agreed, that our target group would be young people from this category\r\nObjectives of the youth exchange:\r\n1. Increase knowledge and understanding about International Labour Standards on employment promotion, discrimination while applying to an open position or during the work. Labour, health and social rights among young people and how to react in case of abusing their rights\r\n2. Support young people in personal development by acquisition of necessary competences (writing motivation letter, preparing CV, searching and applying for job, etc) needed to make smooth gradual transition to labour market, education or training\r\n3. Raise awareness among young people about variety of opportunities for study, training and employment (support programmes, EVS, Erasmus for young entrepreneurs, etc)\r\n4. Enhance employability and improve career prospects of young people from the minority groups that are in highest risk of unemployment, not in training like romas and refugees. As well, as people coming from problematic families or foster homes\r\n5. Promote Erasmus+ programme and non-formal education\r\nBased on problems that we identified and experience of our partners, we create activities, which will help us to reach our objectives. Methodology to carry out the project would be mostly consisting of the non-formal methods- games, teambuildings, visual methods, competitions, role-plays, group work, peer-to-peer learning, discussion, presentations etc.\r\nThe first level of observable impact will obviously be on the 35 participants. The activities designed for this project meant to leave a significant mark on the participants\u2019 lives. Developing of participants will start even before actual activities and will continue after; we expect that our project will create momentum for them, so they will continue developing themselves all their life. They will become an example, role models for hundreds or thousands other young people who don\u2019t know about their labour rights, who don\u2019t know what they want to do in their lives, don\u2019t know how to apply to jobs, how to prepare interview etc. Thus, level of unemployment among NEET will slightly start to fall down.", "http://www.silverfoxne.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-3-RO01-KA105-035311_3"], ["5ND", "A Race for Tolerance.

Definitions have shifted over the centuries from tolerating the existence of different religions to contradicting opinions. People tend to see the term from different angles, from that of freedom and from that of the oppression through \"political correctness\". But it remains at the center of each democratic order, it proves as the main ingredient of durable peace, and it is also a very good way of saving energy and focusing on the important issues instead. \r\nThe two planned activities deal with tolerance and a way how participants can fully express their opinion about it to the public. Participants will learn together what tolerance means to them. They will develop and teach each other methods how to create tolerance in your own surrounding. They will reach out to people, organizations and institutions that also strive for tolerance in the communities of Potsdam and in  Newcastle/Gateshead, either for themselves, for others or to promote it among each others. From them participants will learn, what tolerance means to them. And then they will bring out what they learnt onto the road and to the people in a Tolerance Race. \r\nThe youth exchange is also a theatrical even. Participants will plan, learn, design and rehearse this Tolerance race in a professional fashion for days, will learn their moves, go out and explore life in the two towns, make friends and confront with prejudices of their own and of other people.

Thanks to the effort of NaturKultur e.V. and Leppe\u00acGanespalte Foreningen in Langfjord. The Youth Exchange deals with negative developments in the globalized chain of food producers, food processing enterprises and the final consumers.  The exchange aims to to raise awareness among youth to improve their consciousness for good food, its origins and a responsible ecological behavior of all of us, that will lead to a healthier lifestyle.\r\nIt will take place in Romania, Targu Neamt between 25 September and 3 of October 2017. The youth exchange will bring together youth from \r\nNowadays the largest share of world\u2019s population participates in a global cycle of production, trade, processing and consumption of food. This food is not any more consumed, where it has been produced nor does it reach the end consumer in a raw form. In our global world imported food replaces local food, convenience food and eating out replaces home-cooked food, fast food replaces slow food. Even worse, large quantities of food produced actually never reaches the consumer. Due to distorted consumer demands it is sorted out and thrown away. Food decays during transport and storage or it is taken out of stores due to over-regulated shelf-life prescriptions. Interests of international food conglomerates to sell cheaper products with higher profits lead to the gradual degradation of food. The growth of food is industrialized in plantations, older more healthy races are replaced by genetically modified sorts. Cattle is subjected to inhumane treatment. Mono-cultures become a danger for nature\u2019s sustainability. Food items are redesigned. Its contents are replaced by cheaper products. Artificial spices, colors,  salt, etc. are used to create taste and looks where there are none. Sugar is added to spur hunger for more. Chemicals are added to prolong shelf-life. \r\nBut there is also a growing awareness that such developments lead to higher obesity, increased allergies, destroys nature and deprives local and smaller farmers of good profits. Movements springing up everywhere in the world attempt to stop that development and to increase consumer awareness. They do not stop short there, but actively change their own and others behaviors. There is a movement for fair production prices for third world farmers. There are hundreds of thousands of farmers switching to ecological farming, permaculture, biodynamic farming. There are urban gardeners growing food in their cities. There are the adherents of aquaponics, growing vegetables and raising fish in leftover industrial plantations or even on rooftops. There are those reshaping distribution channels by marketing homegrown food directly into households or from ecological farms into farmers\u2019 markets in the cities. There are also those, who are recycling allegedly \u2018bad\u2019 food sorted out before passing the farm gate or in the wholesale markets. There are even people diving into the dumpsters of supermarkets. There are those who are attempting to provide cheaper and better food through the evasion of packaging, the exchange of industrial food sorts against traditional, more healthy and more valuable ones. \r\nWe design this follow up youth exchange to introduce a large group of participants to the situation, its outlooks and possibilities to act themselves. They will learn from each other about developments in their countries. They will study the importance of transport, storage, sorting, packaging and positioning to influence their consumer behaviors. The will be visiting farmers, wholesale markets, supermarkets to inquire and discover themselves the mechanism of price and production. They will train themselves to read, study, understand and analyze the prescriptions of food. They will attempt to design an own youth-friendly diet by buying, tasting and by cooking food together. We will experience in person the difference between industrial farming and ecological farming. They will be helped by activists, researchers and inspection services. We want this Youth Exchange to be one of several, through which youth workers can learn from youth, how it is possible to mobilize and train young people of their age to become more aware and receptive to a more pleasing food diet, that instantly reduces the ecological \u2018food\u2019 print of generations to come.

Inclusion and multilingual teaching are our hallmarks. On a report of proposed improvements we found the need to adapt our methodologies to include new teaching practices. We are a center with programs and projects based on new technologies, but we also want to improve professional competence through training and the exchange of experiences in other centers. We need to train as teachers in active, innovative methodologies and the implementation of these tools in our classrooms. We created a commission in charge of designing a recycling plan and improving teaching and communication practices.\r\n\r\n The following objectives were formulated:\r\nA) Promote institutional relations. Provide specific plans to internationalize the center and collaborate with other institutions.\r\nB) Develop a more inclusive school culture. Search for teaching-learning groups that are more equitably organized to improve student learning through active methodologies.\r\nC) Develop teacher training and professional knowledge. Improve the teaching quality of our faculty through courses, seminars, linguistic deep-dives, job shadowing, and other training activities.\r\nD) Put these learning processes at the service of the community by organizing collective sessions for feedback. Collaborate amongst colleagues in shared projects and coordinate the development of educational activities.\r\nE) Improve the linguistic and bilingual curricular projects that must be updated and contextualized in order to design them according to the new educational laws.\r\nE) Introduce active methodologies in our classrooms. Active methodologies are necessary to develop our students\u2019 different social and academic skills, and to contribute to the acquisition of key competences.\r\n\r\nWith educational innovation we seek ways of thinking and solving problems.
