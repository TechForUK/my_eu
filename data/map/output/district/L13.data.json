Due to changes in staffing and changed expectations for Primary Language Teaching for NC 2104, the schools feel that it is time to re-invest in high quality training to refresh Spanish teaching and learning. The main objectives are to:\r\nEquip teachers with the linguistic skills and confidence to deliver high quality teaching and learning experiences in Primary Languages;\r\nRaise the profile of Spanish in the school and local community and improve intercultural understanding;\r\nMeet the needs of the new National Curriculum 2014;\r\nIncrease self-confidence of lower attainers and EAL pupils across the curriculum;\r\nRaise pupil attainment in languages and across all subjects;\r\nRe-energise our \u2018Centre of Excellence\u2019 status for Spanish, in order to act as a support for other schools, both locally and nationally.\r\n\r\nThe project is designed to last 2 years, focusing initially on 5 key staff, and then engaging the majority of teaching staff (30 teachers across the Federation) for maximum impact on standards. Many of teachers enjoy language learning and are keen to trial new initiatives in our quest aspiring to be \u2018outstanding\u2019. However, a staff skills audit has shown that most staff hold qualifications in French or other languages, and show less confidence using Spanish. In the past we have been able to offer training ourselves for other schools wishing to develop their language teaching, and now need to refresh our skills, methodology and resources to ensure that we are up-to-date and modelling \u2018outstanding teaching and learning\u2019. \r\n\r\nThe expectations of NC14 Languages state an increased focus on the development of Reading and Writing, so our project will focus on effective ways of developing these skills with pupils, while maintaining the fun elements of language teaching and learning. Links with partner schools will provide opportunity for pupils to have purposeful communication, and use of e-twinning websites and electronic media will allow teachers to develop and share authentic resources to enhance Literacy skills. By visiting partner schools, Teachers will strengthen our links and be able to have professional dialogue about effective teaching methods and use of authentic resources. Staff will also undertake intensive language training on a residential course in Santander, from which they should return with improved linguistic competence and confidence in delivering their own Spanish lessons. This will support us in embedding Spanish throughout the curriculum, so that pupils begin to use the language naturally as a tool for communication. We are interested in developing our CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and will have opportunity to observe this in practice during the residential courses in Cantabria. \r\n\r\nDue to the commitment of the whole staff in this project, we expect the impact to be extensive and not only evident in our Spanish language teaching, but on the school as a whole, and then disseminated nationwide. Standards of teaching and learning in all curriculum areas will be elevated, which will impact on pupils\u2019 motivation and enthusiasm. This may affect their uptake of languages in further education. As small schools in areas of high deprivation, many of our pupils do not have great opportunities to develop their intercultural understanding, so the project would impact on pupils and parents\u2019 attitudes. Furthermore, as we share the outcomes with local media, we expect the school\u2019s profile within the local community to be raised, which could increase pupil stability and our numbers on roll, while attracting new staff. Teachers will be better equipped to meet the needs of National Curriculum 2014, i.e. Language teaching with an increased focus on reading and writing in the target language. Standards in other areas will improve e.g. Literacy due to pupils\u2019 phonological awareness and grammatical understanding being developed in language lessons. Moreover, we have found that language learning significantly increases the self-esteem of lower attaining pupils and those for whom English is an Additional Language, which in turn raises standards in the Core Curriculum areas of Maths and English.", "http://www.stcuthbertsliverpool.co.uk", "St Cuthbert's Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002175_coordinator"], ["0BQ", "Bon Voyage and Bon Appetit", "City of Liverpool College", 72609.0, "In the project coordinated by Oulu Vocational College  (OSAO) the students and experts of Food Technology, Tourism and Hotel, Restaurant and Catering from OSAO, Vocational college Lappia and  Lapland Tourism college have the opportunity to familiarize with international food and travelling cultures in the form of on-the-job-learning and teacher exchange. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students will gain priceless experience and a chance to improve their professionality in an international environment.

The participants in the project are 6 students between 16 and 32 years old living in San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna (a town awarded with the title of World Heritage site) and towns nearby. 5 of them will complete a 2-month stay (FCT) in the United Kingdom (5 days teacher / companion) and another one as EramusPro (3 months) in the United Kingdom to promote their professional training there. In addition 1 teacher will make a 1-week training stay in the United Kingdom, and another teacher will make a preliminary visit to ErasmusPro (3 days). \r\nAmong the abilities developed and promoted in this project, aside from the professional skills, are the language proficiency (very important) and the behavioural capability for the autonomy and adaptation to the determining factors of the globalized market.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049759_2"], ["5TF", "Environmental Responsibility: from Individual to Community Action", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 18670.0, "Linking social inclusion and environment is a means to attain Sustainable development through a comprehensive approach to achieve this goal. The scope of the \"Environmental Responsibility: From Individual to Community Action\" project (hereinafter, ERICA) is to allow young people aged to start getting involved in environmental challenges both on a local and European level. The project involves the organisation of a youth exchange in Portugal for 25 young people and 5 youth leaders in the town of Arrimal, in the Natural Park of Aire and Candeeiros, Portugal. The age of the participants will be between 18-30 years old, and we will ensure that there will be a balanced gender ratio (50%). We will promote the participation of young people who may face cultural, geographical, and social barriers, through the the implementation of specific measures.\r\n\r\nThe ERICA workshop will take place at the end of September 2018 and it will last 6 days. The youth exchange will make use of non-formal learning methodologies to coach the participants about environmental challenges and solutions, their individual responsibility and the array of actions they can take in order to change their attitude and develop community actions. Among the topics of the workshop, the participants will work on: urban/rural relationships, pollution, the European Agenda 2020 and the SDGs, biodiversity and ecosystems loss, and corporate responsibility. Moreover, the workshop will involve activities to develop intercultural and communication skills, as well as strengthening the European values, as \"united in diversity\". The workshop results will be shared on the Facebook page of the project itself, which will be easily recognisable by its logo.\r\n\r\nThe project will have impacts on the participants, who will experience first- hand how to tackle environmental issues, both changing their own attitude and habits, and also through community action, such as volunteering, but also by being entrepreneurial. In the long term, the project aims to encourage the participants to pursue further education paths regarding sustainable development or getting involved through volunteering or work experience. Both participants and youth leaders will have improved key competences, as well as soft-skills, language capabilities, and self-esteem. All these skills will be validated through several instruments, such as Youthpass, Europass, and Open Badges. The participating organisations will have the opportunity to work in two related fields (social inclusion and environment) and the youth exchange will be a chance to better understand the needs of young people  in relation to environmental issues and to develop innovative actions in line with them. Moreover, the local communities where the participants come from will be involved through a small event that the young people will organise after the exchange.

The students are aged between 16 and 20 and live in the Ave Valley, a lacking and needy region in Portugal.  \r\nThis group of trainees includes young under-aged students facing social and economical  deprivation , therefore the need to be monitored.. We request two accompanying teachers for each destination. This is really important because our pupils had never travelled before by airplane and aren't aware of the required procedures when travelling abroad.\r\nThey are young people who are preparing themselves for various professions in the world of design, arts, sports and science. The curricular design foresees 610 hours of training in work context (active training) in companies or institutions whose professional area matches the required training. The professionals in these areas have to answer with great acuity and agility to the demands of globalization with the consequent requirement of quality in the rendering of services. \r\nThe internationalization strategy has allowed and will allow motivating, enriching and unique professional experiences because they are carried abroad. The simple perspective of training outside Portugal, already divulged throughout the school year 2012/2013 and the implementation of the approved European projects since 2012 has motivated young people to study foreign languages and to complete the course with higher quality. The possibility to serve as an apprentice in Liverpool in the United kingdom, in the Island of Tenerife, Greece or Italy is a very strong incentive to invest in school tasks. The experience will be rewarding because it makes Europe reachable to deprived young people. It will be a unique experience, since most of these teenagers have never been to an airport, and some have never been to the capital city.\r\nThis project responds to the need to promote the European dimension of citizenship and to enlarge the horizons of these young people. In today's Europe, the contact with a new culture or a new language is assumed as a necessity which promotes equal opportunities as it will put at their fingertips an opportunity that only young people born in more favourable economical status can have. It will be a concrete response financed by European funds directed to a social stratum always overlooked.

In the professional areas of the arts and science, general culture, the ability to communicate, the development of the interpersonal relationships assume particular relevancy.  It is expected that participants return more mature, less introverted, and more competent, technically and socially speaking. \r\nThe apprenticeship will be certified by the Europass Mobility and in the professional course, since the evaluation of the active training will be integrated in the calculation of the final average classification of the professional course.\r\nThe mobility will take place between April and July 2019. \r\n11thgrade (with the duration of 58 days):\r\n- 5 trainees from the Sports Management Course in the city of Liverpool, in the United Kingdom with a duration of 58 days; \r\n- 3 trainees from the Graphical Design Course in the Island of Syros, in Greece;\r\n- 5 trainees from the Laboratorial Analysis Course  in Lecce, Italy. \r\n12th grade (for 68 days):\r\n- 4 trainees from the Sports Management Course in Tenerife, Spain;\r\nNewly-graduated in Erasmus Pro.\r\n- 5 newly-graduated mobility (to distribute among trainees from Graphic Design, Lab Analysis and Sports Management courses) with the duration of 120 days, will have Italy as their destination between October  and February 2019. \r\n- Mobility of an element of the School Team that implements the projects Erasmus + with the duration of 4 days to prepare the mobility of the 5 participants of Erasmus Pro.\r\n- 2 trainees of the Educational Staff for Lecce for 4 days.", "http://www.erasmus-education.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT01-KA116-046997_4"], ["7DF", "Est\u00e1gios na Europa - novas compet\u00eancias num ambiente multicultural III", "EUDAIMONIA INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION", 119261.0, "The internationalization process of the school is part of the context of globalization, with economic, social, educational and cultural policies.

In conjunction with companies, the school stimulates meetings, where mobility experiences are presented in order to attract entrepreneurs to our institution, promoting qualification and employability. \r\nThe entrepreneurs know that these trainees have the capacity to bring innovations and cutting-edge procedures, giving companies an improvement in the rooted processes, still allowing a change and improvement in the paradigms of the company. \r\nOn the other hand, the trainees will return to school to participate, in addition to the forums with the companies, in activities of dissemination and motivation.

A key aspect of all this is how students and teachers deal with conflicts and whether the school functions as a model of non-violent problem solving skills and methods which are lodged in role-modelling democracy. The main aim of the certification process is not to prescribe best practices to the school but to enhance ownership and making own choices in an appropriate school policy. \r\n\r\nThe project has 5/6 partners, each working with one or two schools in their own country. The project partners start the project by elaborating a draft certification proposal, which has been developed by Centro Montesca and reviewed in the European Anti-Bullying Network, into a testable toolkit. They also undertake a national review of anti-bullying and social inclusion policies as well as needs assessments in the allied schools by doing research among students and staff and by carrying out a school visitation. \r\n\r\nIn the schools, this is the first step of the certification process. In the schools, the second step is to analyse the assessment results and decide about necessary measures. Then the implementation follows during one school year.

They are one of he largest groups of disadvantaged citizens in the EU. Every ten minutes another parent receives the news that their child is disabled. For parents, raising a child with a disability can cause more daily stress, long-range health problems, feelings of isolation, high levels of stress, increasing in depression than parenting a child without disabilities.  They are always lonely, have to work extra to preserve their marriage, worry about dying.\r\nWhen parents learn that their child has a disability or a chronic illness, they begin a journey that takes them into a life that is often\r\nfilled with strong emotion, difficult choices, interactions with many different professionals and specialists, and an ongoing need for\r\ninformation and services. Initially, parents may feel isolated and alone, and not know where to begin their search for information, assistance, understanding, and support.\r\n\r\nOne of the things parents learn when they have a child with special needs is that having a child with special needs is not an after school special, a Lifetime movie, or a very special episode of an otherwise humorous show. It's a whole-life commitment, and generally no one really asks them if they are interested before they sign up. \r\n\r\nSome people romanticize the notion of having a Child with Special Needs.

It is a skill that not only enhances our social lives but also impacts on our employability either as a direct route into jobs e.g. distribution and logistics or by opening up opportunities to a wider job market through accessibility. To be able to drive legally and safely makes you more employable.  However young drivers typically represent between 18% and 30% of all killed drivers, although people in the same age group only represent between 9% and 13% of the total populations in their countries. Traffic crashes are the single greatest killer of 15-24 year-olds in OECD countries and within European countries, among 15-24 year olds, the majority of road fatalities are car occupants (59%) or motorcyclists (19%. Young drivers pose a greater risk than other drivers to themselves, their passengers and other road users, socially and economically excluded young people being highly represented in accident statistics.  Research has indicated that inexperienced drivers, particularly  young male drivers, tend to fall into the category of high risk threshold drivers. These drivers tend to have a particular set of attitudes that are associated with their lifestyles and driving culture. Risk taking  is  perceived  as  a normal part of driving as young people  tend  to  have  higher  sensation  seeking tendencies. This all has a huge economic and social cost on societies\r\n Improving traffic safety and reducing crashes and resulting deaths and injuries is a fundamental objective of the E-DRIVERS project as it aims to address the high levels of young driver risk by taking into account some of the highly complex root causes of the problem which include inexperience, age, gender , physiological and emotional development, personality, social norms and individuals\u2019 socio-economic circumstances. The E-DRIVERS  project will address risky behaviours of young drivers and pre-drivers through needs analysis, peer to peer learning and training programmes.\r\nE-DRIVERS will develop a  learner education and training programme using e-learning and new technologies (e-platform and i- phone application)  and providing  training for interventionists such as teachers, trainers, youth workers, probation officers- people who are not road safety experts but have direct access to the target group. 3 international training events will pilot and test the train the trainers programme , preparing the interventionists to deliver the learner training programme. E-Drivers will produce a trainer handbook, as repository of learning resources and a Handbook of Good Practices for policy makers and those responsible for road safety, community safety, police and justice systems at local and regional level. It is expected that the E-DRIVERS project will impact at 3 levels:\r\n1. on behaviour and attitude of young drivers and pre-drivers\r\n2. on the actions of interventionists who are working with young people, either those at risk of demonstrating risky behaviour, or those convicted of offending behaviour.\r\n3. on organisations at local and regional level which are responsible for road safety\r\nLong term benefits will be that organisations which are responsible for road safety, health and welfare and law and justice  will have an additional countermeasure to risky behaviour in their portfolio. E-DRIVERS is prevention(pre-driver), intervention (learner driver)  and curative (Convicted offender driver)measure, expanding the service offer of local and regional authorities to the local community at the same time as saving money on dealing with road accidents (police, ambulance, fire services etc).", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL01-KA204-035240_4"], ["5TF", "Developing the intrinsic motivation of Adults at risk of social exclusion", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 258240.0, "The I-MOTOLE project developed primarily as a reaction to high drop-out rates in adult education in disadvantaged social-economic environments, and the need to increase upward integration.

Alternative skills and resources for job searching", "MERSEYSIDE EXPANDING HORIZONS LIMITED", 255387.0, "The world is changing, the way we work is changing and also the way we search for a new job is changing. Strategies, tools and skills required, used and needed have suffered a massive evolution in last years, especially in this period of economic crisis. This fact is remarkable in sectors such as first job searchers, long-term unemployed or lowed skills adults looking for a reinsertion in the labor market. Here is important to notice that old strategies and skills are giving place to new ones, in a context where even the concept of intelligence or competence (the capacity, knowledge or ability we acquire to solve a problem) has changed. And obviously, this has affected the working world, independently of the field we are referring to. Job searchers and counselors are obliged to develop new skills and strategies for a new market. Here there is the place for Emotional Intelligence (EI) and extra weapon to keep and increase the levels of employability in a new economic and social scenario. \r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that, at the executive and professional level, emotional intelligence (EI) or \u201cEQ\u201d (Emotional Quotient, as it is often called) is a better predictor of success than \u201cIQ\u201d. The emotionally intelligent person exhibits such competencies as accurate self-assessment, self-control, empathy, influence. The ability to accurately assess and develop these competencies will set organizations apart. This is a key factor for job searchers, especially first job searchers, long-term unemployed or lowed skills adults looking for a reinsertion in the labor market. Management of EI skills will not be important only for their success in job searching, but also will endow them with a huge amount of abilities to make it more stable, reinforcing their employability in a future. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, EI is becoming a plus for counselors which are developing their work in an extremely difficult and changing labour market. Counselors are experts in the external area of job searching (curriculum vitae, ways of searching, use of searchers, preparation of interviews, etc), but now they also need to work the internal area of job searching, that involves EI skills such as self-esteem, self-knowledge, empathy, avoid social isolation, attitude, passion, weaknesses and fortresses, management of frustration, motivation, delay of gratification, management of emotional state. These aspects are basic not only in the process of job searching, but also in the former level of employability and the capacity to stabilize the position, so it has a short term and mid-long term effects.    \r\n\r\nThe project consortium is composed of 6 organisations from 5 different EU countries (UK, IRL, ES, RO and PT) and shows cooperation between new and old European Member States. A comprehensive partnership has been established, consisting of a solid group of training companies with long experience in the application of Emotional Intelligence in their programs and a high demand of this kind of formation.

The online system will also feature a platform for interactions between learners, trainers, mentors and mentees, and other stakeholders. All outputs produced will be freely accessible for the public within and beyond the project\u2019s lifetime.\r\n\r\nEMOTIONAL EMPLOYMENT is likely to have sustainable direct impacts within and beyond the project lifetime on three target groups: 1) job counselors and career guides, 2) job searchers, freelances and self-employees, 3) companies and organizations active in the field of training and advisory services.\r\n\r\nBy creating training tools for improving skills and key competences of counselors and job searchers, the consortium expects to achieve the overall objective of the project: highlight the importance of Emotional Intelligence and social skills (creativity, empathy, cognitive flexibility, teamwork...) in the new economic environment and globalised world. \r\n\r\nThe project wishes to set new tools and methodologies to support career guiders and job searchers in enhancing their efficiency.
