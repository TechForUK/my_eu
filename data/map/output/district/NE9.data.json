We understand the great benefits that can result from international cooperation. We want to develop aspects of our curriculum and teaching methods, particularly improving the teaching of languages in our school and the introduction of new and innovative methods. We believe that languages should not be taught in isolation and we want to integrate our language teaching much more into other areas of the curriculum. We want to introduce many more cross curricular links, joint working and also to introduce CLIL to our school. \r\n\r\nWe are very keen to develop links with schools in Spain and France and would like our staff to have the opportunity to see how other European institutions approach the teaching of CLIL and cross curricular links. \r\n\r\nWe also would like to develop our international links in order to allow our pupils to have more native speaker contact and a greater insight into the reality of life in these countries, making their language learning experience more enjoyable. We believe that this will have a positive impact on the uptake of languages in our school and also on our pupils\u2019 future career choices. \r\n\r\nWe want teachers from other departments to develop language skills so that they are able to work jointly with staff from the MFL department to plan for cross curricular links and the introduction of CLIL. Other areas we wish to focus on as part of this project are; linking literacy and languages in order to support pupils\u2019 literacy development, increasing the use of ICT to support language learning in the development of links with other schools, improving uptake of languages in our school and increasing parental and community involvement in school life.\r\n\r\nWe want to build on work our school is currently doing as an outstanding training school and offer support to other schools.\r\nWe plan to develop project lasting two years that will help us to achieve our aims of modernising our approach to language teaching and becoming an outstanding example of cross curricular working.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve six members of staff each taking part in a progressive series of two courses in either Spain or France. \r\nThe members of staff taking part will be chosen from the MFL department and also from other departments within the school. This will mean that departments are able to work together to plan for a cross curricular approach to teaching and to introduce CLIL to our teaching practice.\r\n\r\nThe new approaches and teaching methods we acquire as part of these courses will result in better pupil engagement and a more enjoyable learning experience for them. Pupils will benefit from the increased confidence of staff and from the reinforcement of their learning across the curriculum. Staff will understand what makes successful CLIL. They will also have the chance to see this in practice through the schools that they will visit as part of the course. \r\n\r\nStaff will quickly develop proficiency in the language. We will develop links between languages and literacy and further engage our pupils through focusing on texts they enjoy and through teaching these through the foreign language. \r\n\r\nThe courses will give us new ideas for ways to raise the profile of languages in our school and involve parents more in their children\u2019s learning. We will also be able to gather ideas and resources which will help us to deliver cultural events that can be used as a way of furthering parental involvement.\r\n\r\nWe will use eTwinning and Skype and encourage our pupils to find out about each other\u2019s lives. All of this will make language leaning more appealing to our pupils and will result in more enthusiasm and greater uptake at GCSE and A Level.", "http://www.cardinalhume.com", "Cardinal Hume Catholic School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012793_coordinator"], ["7HN", "Don't Waste Your Future", "Pareto UK Ltd", 141905.0, "Context/ background of project\r\n\r\nThe Europe 2020 Strategy has a headline target to: 'Reduce ESL  to less than 10% by 2020, from 13.5% in 2011.\r\nThe Project will allow for the transfer of best practices and innovative approaches in this field across Europe, including the countries where the early school leaving rate is significantly above the EU2020 target, e.g. Turkey, UK, Spain, Portugal and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe project is intended to give a strong and visible signal to European VET schools and to research and propose some possible solutions by using identification, prevention, intervention and compensation strategies for reducing the number of ESL in VET.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to establish a network of European VET organisations to facilitate the import and export of best practice and innovative approaches to improve the quality of training for people at risk of ESL or are already early school leavers.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project are to:\r\n\r\n*To reduce the rate of ESL at least 1% in each partner countries.\r\n*To increase the quality of education and provide more involvement in school\r\n*To share best practices and innovative approaches related with the key issues affecting ESL around Europe.\r\n*To produce best practice guide in the partner countries' own language.\r\n*To enable partners to export and import at least 1 innovative aspect of the best practice within their organisation.\r\n*To enable partners to see the application of best practices and innovative approaches through transnational meetings.\r\n*To involve the key stakeholders in  implementation and dissemination activities.\r\n*To share learning from the project by hosting local and European dissemination activities for a wider network\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of participants:\r\nThe Partnership includes 5 partners from Turkey, UK, Spain, Portugal and Italy.

This is a project whose main objective is to promote among the pupils of the partner schools the importance of sport, exercise and a healthy diet as well as to make them aware of all the consequences smoking and taking drugs have.  All the work will be completed by accomplishing particular tasks and activities. The project will involve pupils of all the educational levels, both boys and girls, pupils with special needs, teachers, school staff, parents and local community. The theories applied in this program are Situated cognition and Distributed cognition. That being supported by technology, creates more authentic learning environments. Also the use of innovative communication technology, which has become an integral part of our lives, is of vital importance. It will definitely encourage young learners to get involved in the project and enable them easier access to all the project's materials, resources and necessary information. Besides, the project's coordinators as well as the pupils will be able to communicate by means of the e-platform.The main purpose of our project is promoting a healthy lifestyle in various aspects and areas of life by means of innovative technology such as the e-platform which is one of the main sources of communication between the partner schools and the project's materials. As we have experience relevant to the work, we will be able to successfully achieve the project's objectives with the benefit not only for our school but also for the local society and the region. Health promotion is currently a top priority, therefore, international cooperation opens up new horizons and gives new perspectives on challenges of the contemporary world. This way, we wish to present to our pupils, their parents and local community the importance of healthy diet and physical activity as well as the benefits of such attitudes. The benefits resulting from the attitudes and the habits shaped in the course of the project implementation may bear fruit in the participants' future. The targets of our project also  include creating and promoting healthy school environment; promoting healthy eating habits; caring for pupils' well-being, developing and boosting their self-esteem and developing their social skills; supporting pupils with special needs (both physical and educational); making the pupils aware of danger of smoking and taking drugs.A series of activities to achieve the established objectives has been planned. One of them is creating The European Cook Book including recipes for traditional meals based on healthy food. Another task is a new sports game for all the pupils of the partner schools. Besides, we will organize a European Festival and make Healthy School Posters which will be use as teaching materials in all the partner schools and in each school pupils and teachers will start a yard where they will grow fresh vegetables and herbs. The products will be used in school kitchens and served with the meals.We wish all the final products of the project tasks to become a useful source of pedagogical and educational knowledge for other teachers and pupils. The final result of the project is greater awareness of pupils, teachers, parents and local community how important the role of school in health promotion is. It is worth highlighting that this is the role of all the European schools. We also hope that the project will make both the pupils and the teachers change their lifestyle for better.As long-term benefits from the project we wish the tasks and activities to be strictly integrated with the schools\u2019 work plans and to be continued when the project is completed. The tasks and activities will also become an integral part of school subjects as some elements and outcomes of the activities will be included in the subjects\u2019 performance plans. The final products and results of particular tasks will be used as teaching aids during obligatory and extra classes in all the partner schools in order to sustain developed healthy habits and attitudes.", "http://www.cardinalhume.com", "Cardinal Hume Catholic School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024627_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["6SX", "RR7", "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NE9"}
