The project aims at developing a versatile method for standoff chemical identification of trace amounts of airborne pollutants, such as biochemicals, bacterial threats and explosive materials that can be fingerprinted using their characteristic vibrational Raman spectral signatures. The core idea of the proposal is to enable a free-space scheme for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) in the direction exactly reversed with respect to an outgoing laser excitation, so that the probe beam can be arbitrarily pointed in any unobstructed direction and an enhanced backward propagating signal detected at the laser source using a LIDAR-type apparatus. The radical advantage, as compared to incoherent light probing techniques, lies in coherent enhancement, which implies that light fields are phase-matched, i.e. added in phase, so that the signal propagation is confined to very narrow solid angle and the signal magnitude scales quadratically with interaction length and the concentration of the resonantly vibrationally excited molecules. Although this sounds like a perfect recipe for increasing the range, speed, and sensitivity of a chemically sensitive standoff detection method and/or decreasing the minimum required laser power, the scheme with a CARS signal returning from a free-space unobstructed laser beam has not been demonstrated yet because of a fundamental challenge: to initiate phase-matched generation in the backward direction, a fraction of the excitation light has to be reflected or re-scattered backwards. However, in natural atmospheric conditions, backward light scattering in air is extremely weak. The grand technological and scientific challenge in this proposal is to apply free-space CARS that would rely on the air itself as a diffuse back-reflector controllable through a reversible interaction with a strong field of an ultrashort intense laser pulse , the so-called light filamentation.", 166365.0, 2506049.0, "CROSS TRAP", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_93598_991860018"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7XL", "Kreatywno\u015b\u0107 w wymiarze mi\u0119dzynarodowym", "Stadhampton Primary School", 17555.0, "The \"Creativity in the international dimension\" project meets the needs of our institution (school).School is a place where both within a few years we equip students with knowledge in various fields, but also we use  the great potential of creativity, ingenuity and openness to learning about the world. We develop talents, promote achievement, we care about the quality of education in our school based on the assumption that the school must take into account the changes taking place in today's world. We are aware of the challenges  in the modern world. General availability and rapidly growing ability to use modern technology makes the teacher to be a guide for the student in this new reality. That is why the teacher must become competent in the field of information and computer technology.The objectives of this project include improving the quality of school work, enriching school activities and the educational offer, extend theachers' competences (including language, IT), broaden their knowledge. The objectives include also implementation of the acquired knowledge and skills in working with students, Students are the ultimate recipients of the effects and results of the project. We also want to increase students' motivation to learn. W hope the teachers will  increase job satisfaction and recognition in a social environment.Teachers directly involved in the project are teachers of early education (2 persons) and teachers of maths, science and English (3 persons, including the headmaster). They are people who will be happy to improve their workshop. They look for new methods of teaching, they are open to change and implement new ideas. During the project we want to take action to develop our competence (participation in trainings / courses and the action of \"job-shadowing\"). These actions will result in the implementation of new educational projects. In the project we will co-operate with the English school (Stadhampton), so we will deepen the international dimension of education in our school (long-term benefit).We are convinced that the benefits of the project not only teachers participating in courses and trainings, but the whole school community. We are a school where all teachers have a good relationship, we are happy to share our experiences, cooperate in solving problems and creating various events at school and beyond. Experience gained in the project will be shared with our colleagues.", "http://www.stadhampton.oxon.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA101-023895_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "OX44"}
