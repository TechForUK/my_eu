They will engage through a series of European and regional workshops.   GAP1 represents phase 1 of a three-phase programme that aims to explore the complementary nature of alternative knowledge and investigate how to combine it in ways that will enhance understanding and management of natural resources.  Tied to knowledge, GAP1 is an evidence-based approach that uses participation as the vehicle to improving understanding on fisheries research and management issues of common concern to stakeholders, scientists and policy makers. This is a pre-requisite for fostering the mutual respect essential for successful future collaboration.   Through initiation of cooperative research and helping build the capacity of stakeholders to engage in participatory research, GAP1 contributes towards the wider aspiration of the Science in Society programme. In particular, to enhance democratic debate with a more engaged and informed public, thus providing better conditions for collective choices on scientific issues relating to sustainable management, conservation of ecosystem integrity and biodiversity of the marine environment.", null, 672846.0, 11, 29, "GAP1", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2011-08/45658.jpg", "fp7_89991_995591608"], [1301616000000, 1427760000000, "Bridging the gap between science, stakeholders and policy makers \nPhase 2:Integration of evidence-based knowledge and its application to science and management of fisheries and the marine environment", "South Devon and Channel Shellfishermen Ltd", "GAP2 is about making a difference to an issue of significance to the whole of society; the wellbeing of the marine environment and the sustainability of fisheries upon which society depends for food.

Three of the students are from the fashion department. As our students are trained in modern languages, we have chosen the following countries for the internship: Italy, France, Malta, Ireland, Spain and Great Britain. Our students will be trained in theory (language skills) and in practice beforehand. Additionally, they will be supported by the Erasmus+ team (contact via WhatsApp/facebook) during the internship.After the internship an evaluation will be carried out by the partner hotel. Means of evaluation will be the ECVET \u2013 form and the Learning Agreement.Students are encouraged to gain further practical knowledge and skills in hotel industry which have already been provided in theory in order to be well-prepared for their future working life. Therefore our students should be given the possibility to work in fields like:restaurant, reception, bar, administration, room service, housekeeping, concierge, seminar and conference area. From our point of view, there will be a noticeable increase in the employability because of the internship.Besides improving their practical skills, our trainees should strengthen their social skills and their self-confidence (personal capabilities), which means that responsibility, independency, self-confidence, ability to work on their own, team spirit, ability to listen, friendliness, ability to communicate with their superiors, colleagues and guests. Moreover, our students should encounter the differences of various cultures and traditions and their characteristics to develop an open-minded tolerance.Another important aim is to improve language skills. Students should be able to use their acquired language skills in order to broaden their communication skills in daily work life.Furthermore, we would like to stress that the sense of belonging to the European Union should be created and increased to make the EU be realized as a chance for personal and professional development. Employing foreign students in their hotels, people show interest in different nationalities and also in the willingness to train and support the young. This will be documented by using the following tools: Letter of Intent, Learning Agreement, Personal Transcript, Europass and ECVET. The hotel is not only a working but also learning place.We are primarily looking for hotels in the 4 or 5 stars category to ensure a high standard not only concerning the working but also the learning conditions. In cooperation with the Erasmus+ Team the students work out tasks of the Learning Agreement and the results will be discussed. Teachers will visit their students at their hotels to deepen the personal contact and to assure the quality of the internship.For school, this project is evidence of a professionally grounded education, which will finally be documented by annual reports, parents\u2019 evening, Erasmus+ Day, personal diary entries of the participants as well as broadcasts in the media (local TV, newspapers, websites).The aspired project goals are assured by a professional quality management team (G. Malle, B. Potz, M-A. Schwarz) and teachers working in the fields of economy and modern languages.ECVET elements will be used to emphasize comparison and sustainability of the project. Using these tools, the cooperation with the hotels will be intensified. That\u2019s why increased action of the accompanying teachers will be necessary especially at the beginning.Apart from the EU aspect, long-term impacts on the participant, school site and the Austrian educational system are stressed. Our participants will be able to profit from their work experience in the long run, school site will face an enhancement of the public image and finally, it has to be mentioned that these projects are vital for the Austrian educational system to broaden the horizon of the participants in order to appreciate the importance of the EU.", "http://www.thurlestone.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016376_9"], [2014, "trainees and trainers gain international competences", "Thurlestone Hotel", 103969.0, 8, 11, "Aim of the project: 70 participants(students, trainees, trainers and teachers) of different middle schools and voc.higher schools  as well as Vocational Schools of the region Carinthia take part in this project to gain international work experience as well as three accompanieing people.

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.\r\n\r\nDue to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.thurlestone.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034653_2"]]}}}}
