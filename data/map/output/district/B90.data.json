Safety technologies have shown outstanding capabilities for supporting the driver in hazardous situations. Despite their effectiveness, currently available systems are typically implemented as independent functions. This results in multiple expensive sensors and unnecessary redundancy, limiting their scope to premium-class vehicles.The project is based on the concept that by integrating applications together, vehicle components may be shared among the various safety systems. This is accomplished in interactIVe by discrete architectural layers that are common to all applications. These provide large amounts of knowledge about the driver, state of the vehicle, and the environment to all interested applications. The overall result is an optimal use of resources, lower implementation costs, and ultimately a much broader acceptance of the technology.Although application and sensor fusion is an active area of study, substantial amount of research is still required before its commercial feasibility. By building upon current state-of-the-art technologies, interactIVe will develop next-generation safety systems based on three pillar concepts, namely continuous driver support, collision avoidance, and collision mitigation.The core activities of the project will address the design and development of the Intelligent Vehicle Systems, whose capabilities will be shown in demonstrator vehicles.

Participants are passing through practice abroad to improve their future employability and job mobility. Participants will develop professional competence, they will make linguistic progress (improvement in everyday and professional English and conversation), develop personality (independence, taking care of themselves, orientation in a foreign environment and adaptability, self-esteem). Participants will acquire work habits (checking out the real working environment, management and organization of work, incorporation into the workforce), increase the financial literacy (independent expenditure planning and management of the entrusted funds).  They become familiar with new cultural and economic environment (knowledge of another culture, lifestyle and standard of living).\r\n\r\nThe project outcomes will be reflected primarily in the professional level of the participants. They will have experience from abroad, new knowledge and skills, work habits, life experience, greater perspective and increased mobility. Internship will also bring participants greater independence and self-confidence, higher level of English, increased motivation for further education and improved financial literacy. Participants will improve their position when entering university or job after graduation and make new private and business contacts. Other outputs from the project will be Europass mobility, certificates from intermediary organizations, certificates or recommendations from beneficiary organizations photo documentation from internships (from workplaces and leisure time) and articles in newspapers or on the Internet.\r\nThanks to foreign internships, participants will receive new professional competences, knowledge and skills that will make their entry into the labor market easier. Some participants will increase their motivation to study at domestic university or will be interested in studying abroad.\r\nThe school will improve the vocational training and teaching of English.

It was also the effort of our school to increase the quality of vocational education and training, to support the teaching of foreign languages and to achieve the objectives of the school\u00b4s European Development Plan in the field of mobility projects.
