This bacterium resides in the intestinal tracts ofinfected hosts and is transmitted from the faeces of people and animals. Salmonellosis is one of the most common enteric (intestinal) infections and is the second most common food borne illness. There are several types of strains, but two of them, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium, are responsible for half of all human infections. Once in the egg, Salmonella is very resistant. A person infected with the Salmonella enteritidis bacterium begins to show symptoms of infection 12 to 72 hours after consuming contaminated food - with infection lasting 4 to 7 days. While most persons recover with or without antibiotic treatment, diarrhoea can be sufficiently severe to require hospitalisation. The elderly, infants, pregnant women and those with impaired immune systems are more at risk with the potential of infections spreading from the intestines to the blood stream and to other body parts and ultimately threatening the life of the infected individual.\nThe main objective of the OVOSHINE project is to develop a low cost, secure and fast UV system in combination with hot air to sterilise eggs.\nThe proposed technology provides the following advantages:\n\u2022 Unlike other treatments, the OVOSHINE system does not increase the temperature of the egg.\n\u2022 The entire egg shell will be illuminated by highly energetic UV photons that will eliminate the bacteria.\n\u2022 No chemical products will be used, thus eliminating egg contamination.\n\u2022 A continuous sterilisation system will be used, to be inserted in the production or packing line, facilitating the installation in existing modern production lines.\n\u2022 The disinfection process is both fast and of low cost, amounting to a very small contribution to the total egg cost.", 415835.0, 2161706.0, "OVOSHINE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.darouv.co.uk", null, "fp7_188528_947652074"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9QZ", "A Step Beyond 2015", "The Great House Hotel and Restaurant", 46469.0, "According to the curriculum for our type of school, students must participate in an internship for 12 weeks.

Our desire for this European dimension is part of this approach and fits in perfectly with this ambition. All the students who have completed their studies in Business and Administration in our school have been offered a trip abroad to a major European city at some point. Since 2004, the school has taught European Classes in English and Spanish on a voluntary basis with vocational subjects taught in English. The school has been involved in three European funded projects for nearly ten years : The Comenius, Leonardo and Erasmus Projects. A financial contribution has been granted by the school for each student having a work experience abroad. This 24-month mobility project is intended to students in our vocational school studying Administration, retail or Sales. The target group consists of students who were not allowed to attend  schools that teach academic subjects therefore seeing themselves as failing at school. Only a few of them came here because they wanted to , most of them being here because they have no other choice. The factors that could motivate the students  do not seem to appeal to them. This project will therefore  help  to remotivate them, to highlight their efforts and restore their self-confidence, to bring them back the pleasure of learning and doing their schoolwork regularly but also to make them aware of the European reality in all its diversity and richness and help them realize all the opportunities that Europe can offer. This  group of 8 boys and girls who are in the final year of a 3- year course  will go to Bristol for five weeks from mid-September to late October. Most of them who are 17 to 19 years old, belong to the European class designed to prepare them at school for this experience abroad including extra English lessons and extra lessons of vocational  subjects taught in English every week. In Bristol, they are placed in a host family on their own with no other guest. The mobility starts with a week  of intensive English Language courses organis ed by Acad\u00e9mie Aquitaine,our intermediate partner for five years, Debbie being also the contact person and their tutor during the stay. Practising English and role-plays in working situations help them build  self-confidence before the training period starts the following week. This 4-week internship from late September to the mid-term holiday  is set,  according to the dates of the fifth training period done by all our students in their final year. On their flight to Bristol, the group is accompanied by their English teacher who takes this opportunity to meet the companies and shops\u2019 managers again and remind them of the objectives to reach. At the end of the mobility, two teachers in Sales and Administration visit each workplace to fill in the official Assessment grid together with the student and the tutor and then fly back with them. This project also supports the attainment of training objectives in a  European context where company practices are different. These  assessments are taken into account in the vocational subjects of their final exam. This experience abroad is also tested during an oral exam which helps the beneficiary graduate with the European class option. The Europass portfolio and the Europro certificate are given to the students on a special European evening at the school. Through mobility the beneficiaries can certify the skills acquired and the competences developed such as integration, independence, open-mindedness, communication in a foreign language. We have been able to assess the progress made by the students in:\r\n- the need for mobility as many plan to have other work experiences in Europe\r\n- job and career opportunities on the European market\r\n- their ability to adapt to a new context (personal or professional)\r\n- European citizenship\r\n- diversity of European culture and cultural understanding\r\n- increased self-confidence and a greater maturity\r\n- more educational opportunities at a higher level.\r\nToday our school wants to play an important role in the European projects and disseminates the benefits. We have been contacted by The house of Europe in Bordeaux for a few projects and by the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust in London, the organisation which oversees specialist schools in England, to organise a vocational study visit for teachers to Bordeaux. The focus of the visit was to look at good practice in the areas of vocational education/bilingual teaching.", "http://www.sueryder.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014088_1"], ["9QZ", "A Step Beyond 2016", "The Great House Hotel and Restaurant", 89701.0, "According to the curriculum for our type of school, students must participate in an internship for 12 weeks.
