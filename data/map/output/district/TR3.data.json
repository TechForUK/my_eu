The \u201cStories We Can Tell! Youth united in diversity projects\u201d idea was created by secondary school students from Pszczyna Poviat in classes covering the topic of foreign traditions and cultures.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to build up international cooperation among project partners that will lead to creating opportunities for language skills improvement and key competences development of the participants, who, in majority, come from socially and economically underprivileged areas. The additional aim of the project is to discover the culture through getting to know beliefs, legends and tales of a particular country. \r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are mostly young people aged 16-20, coming form rural areas, often from families striving against unemployment as well as social or cultural barriers. \r\n\r\nThe main actions of the project are based on analysing interviews carried out by the young people with senior citizens who have presented to them long-forgotten stories, tales, legends or beliefs connected with their cultural identity and the region they descend from. The participants will have to analyse the contents and find a common link. They will be divided into international working teams with the English language as a common language. The non-formal educational tools used during the project will be as follows: energisers and warm-ups, integration activities, simulation and city games, debates, art, film, photography and drama workshops.\r\n\r\nThe young people will acquire particular knowledge on history, geography, social and political conditions in the participating countries, as well as learn the basic language of the hosting and visiting countries.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the influence of the project on the participants we assume the following: an actual progress in the English language usage (spoken and written), removing sociological and psychological barriers (through increasing self-esteem, analysing one\u2019s weaknesses and strength etc.), as well as openness to new innovative tools connected with non-formal education. We also plan to award the participants with Youthpass certificates and educate them on the benefits of the Europass.\r\nThe project will significantly affect the activities of the Foundation, the partner groups and also the local community.\r\n\r\nThe potential long-term advantages are, undoubtedly, establishing contacts among partner groups and acquiring experience that will allow the young people to decide to study or work abroad without further restraints.", "http://www.tr14ers.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-PL01-KA105-013198_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TR3"}
