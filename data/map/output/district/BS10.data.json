In this field, the democratization of digital tools has provoked a spouting of new contents, ideas and commitments, premises of ongoing profound changes that rattle the practices along with the actors and the public.In the meantime, a lack of synergy between the different functions carrying the digital mutation (research, creation, pedagogy, diffusion and valorisation) led to some deadlocks. The latters range from disciplinary imperviousness to inadequate relations between researchers, artists, educators and mediators, or from the very form of the new art pieces, the matter of their presentation to the public, to pedagogical concerns regarding the teaching of digital tools and their concepts.In that frame, and by this fact, EASTN-DC actions aim at:- Experimenting this synergy between research, creation, pedagogy, diffusion and valorisation at the European level- Proposing new models for cooperation and digital contents production connecting Art, Science and Technology.- Establishing a sustainable base for a large European network in the field of time-based digital arts.To do so, EASTN-DC is gathering 17 partners in 13 different countries from Europe to the Americas.
