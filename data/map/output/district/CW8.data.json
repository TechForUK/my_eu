Students are required to develop technical knowledge, skills and experience in addition to linguistic competence in the fields of service of food and beverages, in bartending, hotel management and in travel agencies. The preparation of work placements will be jointly carried out by the partners of the project. \r\nThe students should gain knowledge of operations management and control processes from a European perspective. They should get a clearer understanding of the European language and culture of the country where the placement takes place. The placement abroad should help to increase self-confidence and interest in tourism-related jobs.\r\nThe sending partner is responsible for preparing the trainees for their placements so that they are aware of the culture of the receiving partners' country and to ensure that their trainees have the required linguistic and technical skills  for  work placements.\r\nThe sending partner  selects those young people who can benefit most from the program. The students have to agree to the  individual learning objectives and action plans of their host companies. The sending partner will send this information to the receiving partners. The receiving partners will make sure that the participants get adequate job offers and send work placement information to the sending partner so that the participants can  be adequately prepared before going abroad.\r\nThe receiving partners will be responsible for providing support to the participants during their placements. They will inform the work placement provider, will assist with the continual assessment of each participant and provide individual skills profiles on completion. The  final assessment will be carried out at the workplace by the host company and the receiving project manager.\r\nOne main target of the project is to make the  participants aware of the different cultures and different tourism systems operating in the EU member states.\r\nThe project will promote vocational training of young people and prepares them for their working life and the technological changes for which the travel & tourism industry is renowned. \r\nThe development of linguistic skills is an essential part of the project.  The coordinator maintains the view that Germany will not be included in the program as the language acquisition does not play any role whatsoever.\r\nIn order to be able to gain appropriate experience, a minimum length of stay in a foreign country is necessary. Our students are obliged to undergo practical trainings  8 weeks at the Higher Vocational School) in the fields of service as well as cooking, in  reception work (including customer services ) and in bartending, wine expertise, event management and in many more fields.\r\nAs there is no compulsory international training, this project offers a unique opportunity for the students to work abroad and to gain experience not only in practical areas of education but also in theoretical areas, such as foreign language training. \r\nIt has been agreed that a suitable length of stay is between 8 and 12 weeks . This enables complete integration into all aspects of the work process.  This length of stay also enables students to experience both professional and social everyday life in the host country.  The selection of the host countries is based upon the languages offered at our school (English, Italian, French, Spanish).  Emphasis is  placed upon work exchanges with Italy, the UK and France. A participation in the project will clearly demonstrate the flexibility and mobility of our students, two  qualifications which are expected from future employers.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA102-034857_7"], ["2ES", "A Step Beyond 2018", "Nunsmere Hall Limited", 85026.0, "According to the curriculum for our type of school, students must participate in an internship for 12 weeks. Furthermore, this 12 week internship is required for students to enter their fourth year of study and to take the preliminary examination (Vorpr\u00fcfung) needed for the matriculation examination (Reifepr\u00fcfung).\r\n\r\nIn previous years, our school has organised the obligatory internship for our third year students in a restaurant or hotel abroad with the help of the Lifelong Learning Programme  (LLP) Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+.  This LLP provides our interns with financial support to help lower the overall cost for their families.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are that the students can acquire the skills and abilities expected by the economy. In dealing with him/herself: self-esteem, self-confidence, a sense of basic trust, appreciation, self-efficacy, introspection, self-responsibility, and self-discipline. In dealing with others: attention, appreciation, empathy, ability to comprise, insight into human nature, ability to take criticism, awareness, tolerance, respect, language competence (especially in the foreign language), and intercultural competence. In regards to teamwork: ability to work in a team, cooperation, motivation, ability to confront conflicts, communication skills, and also general skills and abilities such as responsibility, diligence, flexibility and commitment.\r\n\r\nThis year we will be dispatching 32 students to partner companies in England, Italy and Spain.  Students will not only get their first professional experiences in an international environment, but also be able to apply their specialized practical knowledge along with their specialized theoretical knowledge.  Third year students know that they will not only be learning how businesses operate in other countries.  As interns, they must also learn other aspects of the work environment including managing to communicate with coworkers and superiors in a foreign language as well as taking care of guests in a multilingual environment.  The practical, linguistic, and social skills acquired by our students are very important for school but more so for their future professional careers.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the preparedness and quality of the internship, there is a monitoring system during the entire preparatory phase and also during the time abroad through E-mail and/or telephone.  The supervisors are also very important during the internship.  Through personal contact with the tutors and guest organisations, we can improve the quality of the job positions provided to our students.  At our school, we support our interns through monthly meetings.  The team of teachers in charge also meet with students in their free time.  During the holidays, teachers stay in touch with our interns and are accessible through E-mail and cellphones.  The interns will be prepared together by the HBLW Saalfelden\u2019s trained team of teachers, which the program coordinator, Birgit Tatzreiter, is accountable for.  In addition to information sessions at the school, participants will also gather useful knowledge for their internships in school subjects such as \u201cInternational Communication in Business\u201d and \u201cCooking;\u201d furthermore, students have the opportunity to attend a seminar titled \u201cContent and Language Integrated Learning.\u201d\r\nThe results we expect from these internships are not limited to good grades on the preliminary exam for matriculation (Vorpr\u00fcfung), but also include a significant improvement in our students\u2019 language skills.

It is necessary that teachers discover new teaching activities and procedures. The classical approach in teaching STEM (science, technology, engineering y mathematics) creates passive learners; while it\u2019s important to engage pupils in order to have them take an active role (Bednar, Coughlin, Evans, & Sievers, 2002).\r\nTherefore, in order to achieve this aim we\u2019re going to teach based on multiple intelligences using outdoor activites. We think that learning should not only prepare one for life, but should also be an integral part of life itself. Simulating real problems and real problem-solving is one function of project based learning. Projects assist students in succeeding within the classroom and beyond, because they allow learners to apply multiple intelligences in completing a project they can be proud of. Our society values individuals who can solve problems creatively, using multiple strengths, so why shouldn't we encourage students to do the same?  \r\nThis project will be carried out by secondary school students (12-16 year-old). Students with different social backgrounds will be involved and work together in all activities. Target groups of 50 pupils will be formed in each partner school to participate directly in activities, although our aim is that all school students take part in it either directly or indirectly. On the other hand a group of teachers will be coordinating and supervising activities in each school. \r\n\r\nOur aim is that activities will be carried out for all students, that means students with different competences, intelligences, capacities and social backgrounds. We\u2019ve designed next activities:\r\n1. Erasmus+ corner at each school \r\n2. Website on Etwinning and a Project website to share all the process and activities.\r\n3. In the journalist's footsteps: surveys about our project topic. \r\n4. My school is cool \u2013 Lipdub: Students prepare a lipdub at their schools.\r\n5. Camping experience: Students spend 2-3 days camping. They will be hiking, collecting materials, building models and drawing geographics maps. There will also do a geocaching activity.\r\n6. My universe: Students will learn about astronomy, visit a science centre where do direct observations and interviews. \r\n7. Solidarity Event: Students take part in organising a solidary event at their schools. \r\n8. My history: Students find out about their local history, by asking people in the families and old members of community. Finally, they have to tell the story to the class by using drama. \r\n9. As a weatherman: Students observe the weather regularly, and they keep a record in a data base, prepare a weather forecast as TV presenter, print results weekly, make comparisons with other partners result, etc.\r\n10. Let's move - Erasmus+ flashmob: Students play a flashmob. They learn to dance and play. \r\n11. Graffiti Wall: Students draw graffiti wall abouty their feelings or everything they want to show or talk about.  \r\n12. Model making: Students analyze their enviroment (countryside, forest, etc) based on model making. Also, they will model means of transport, and use it to study movement, friction, etc. \r\n\r\nOur methodology will be based on 3 key aspects:\r\n-Multiple Intelligences: Each student is different so we have to provide them different tools to reach the objectives. Therefore, we should move from traditional teaching strategies to 21st century teaching scenarios.\r\n\r\n-Outdoor enviroment: we think that to help all the students to use their full thinking potential, it is necessary not only to teach them in classroom what a good mindset is, also we need to find ways to convince students of the value of the teaching. Because outdoor and adventurous activities facilitates authentic or experiential learning and gives better access to the main pathways to learning.\r\n\r\n-ICT and new technologies: they will be pivotal to the success of our project. We're living in a digital world.\r\n\r\nBy mixing of all these components, our aim is to increase students\u2019 motivation by promoting active learning through direct personal experiences. We\u2019re going to deal with each activity from the 8 intelligences (Howard Gardner model).\r\n\r\nExpected RESULTS are: websites, computer presentations, leaflets, posters, videos, books, costumes, mockups, school panels, plays, surveys, interviews, graphs, films, drawings and paintings, photos, writings, etc. \r\n\r\nThe desired IMPACT on the participants, participating organisations, target groups and other relevant stakeholders will be using new methodologies to improve quality education, open student\u2019s minds in all senses (towards Europe, Education, cooperation, etc), be aware of ICT culture and how to use it to solve problems, and improve student\u2019s motivation as well.", "http://www.st-nicholas.cheshire.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA219-016008_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4EE", "INFORMATION CATALYST FOR ENTERPRISE LTD*", 600110.0, "Fostering secure European societies (18.05.03.01)", "fts_2017_7222", 2017], ["4EE", "INFORMATION CATALYST FOR ENTERPRISE LTD*", 216973.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (09.04.03.01)", "fts_2017_7857", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["1AW", "RBT", "Victoria Infirmary (Northwich)"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CW8"}
