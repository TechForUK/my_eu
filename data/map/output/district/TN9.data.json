The number of turbulence accidents has been growing by a factor of 5 since 1980. A whole class of turbulence (Clear Air Turbulence), representing 40% of turbulence accidents, cannot be detected by any existing equipment including state-of-the-art weather radar. Operational concepts for the protection against turbulence hazard, based on a UV LIDAR, are: - Short-range measurement of air speed ahead of the aircraft and action on the flight controls, - Medium-range detection of turbulence, and securing of passengers by seat belts fasten. The short-range concept has been validated in the frame of the FP5 AWIATOR project. The objective of DELICAT is to validate the medium range turbulence detection (based on backscattered energy fluctuations). In development phase, both short and medium range will be integrated in single equipment. The validation of medium range turbulence detection is based on the comparison of LIDAR data and aircraft sensors data. - A UV LIDAR mock up is designed, manufactured and flight-tested, - The LIDAR data and the aircraft sensors data are compared off line for the same atmosphere area. The consortium assembled for the DELICAT project includes all the expertise necessary to reach the objective, and will take advantage of previous projects such as FP5 AWIATOR and FP6 FLYSAFE. The project resources are globally adapted to the project ambitious objectives and innovation content. DELICAT takes advantage of existing hardware (laser sub assemblies, test aircraft fairing) to achieve the goal at lower possible cost. The DELICAT project will directly contribute to the objectives of the AAT.2008.3.3.2. topic by increasing customer safety; the objective is to reduce the number of turbulence accidents by 40%.

DELICAT designed and tested components such as the transmitter, beam steering system and receiver modules to prepare the device for in-flight testing.\n\nFor this to take place, researchers developed a test strategy, prepared the aeroplane for integration of the device, and installed the prototype.\n\nThe device was tested in flight and detected some light turbulence in specific conditions. No heavy turbulence was encountered during testing, so the DELICAT device has yet to be tested in those conditions.\n\nIf future tests prove successful, the DELICAT device could become a key component of all commercial aircraft in the future.

In Europe BIM is becoming more and more studied in VET schools, VET courses and university courses and applied in companies. It is becoming a new specialization with a high rate of employability.In Italy this methodology is not yet sufficiently known and spread, while in other EU countries, especially in northern Europe, BIM is already very well know and used: Finland is one of the earliest adopters of BIM, and it has been for years at the forefront of Building Information Modelling; in other northern european countries like Norway BIM research and development goes back to more than twenty years ago, and nowadays it\u2019s one of the leading Countries using BIM with one of the European highest implementation of BIM among architects and installators.Considering the lack of homogeneous tools validated at European level for training in BIM, this project has the aim of building a bridge between Northern Europe and Southern Europe: Italy will have the opportunity to learn from the European best experiences paving the way to other Southern Europe Countries, while Finland and Norway will have the opportunity to enlarge their international BIM-related network of institution and companies and update  their knowledge from mutual exchange of best practices and innovation of training tools.Excellence in the area of BIM is possible at the moment only through transnational cooperation, standing the big difference of knowlege, awareness, entrepreneurial attitudes and implementation rates among EU Countries.The project GENERAL AIM therefore is to deepen knowledge about Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a skills' development training subject for employability goals, upgrading existing training tools and professional qualifications and creating a network to promote work-based learning with special attention to apprenticeship.BIM project is a capacity building project in the area of VET promoting cooperation and partnership among 6 different organizations (VET provider, Regional Authority, 2 universities, private company, EU association).
