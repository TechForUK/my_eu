Over the course of 24 months the project activities will provide students, aged 13-15, and teachers a platform to gain a deeper understanding of the role and impact of media in their EU community, of social media in school and education and also learn about social medias role in democracy.  \r\n\r\nHow students interact with media has seen a drastic change with access to many different forms of media readily available for those with a smart phone and an internet connection. For many this can be seen as merely a convenience, however, from the point of view of education this is also representing a fundamental shift in the changes that our students and teachers are currently undergoing. No longer is the world of education and learning bound by school walls, books and  teachers ability to teach. With this media and social media revolution combined with the catalyst of easy to use and readily available ICT, students and teachers have never before had so many means to achieve so much pedagogical potential.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to use modern ICT methods in a multinational atmosphere to examine the role of media in the lives of students and by dong so also provide teachers a new resource for teaching and new teaching skills. Therefore the project complements the aspects of being both competence and content based in its methods and objectives. \r\n\r\nThe primary result of the project will be to create a \"Media Citizenship magazine\" which will contain all the Tabarticles and JointTab Articles created over the course of the project. The project will be based on 4 key stages. 1- Media in context, 2- Media in my community, 3- Social media in education, 4- Social media in Democracy. We aim to have a minimum of 16 mobilities of students (aged 13-15) and 12 teachers per country over the course of the 24 months. \r\n\r\nStudents will create \"TabCasts\" (TC) in short video clips form using tablet computers which are related to the 4 key stages. \r\nEach TC will be recorded by the students in which students will present their researched findings on the relevant key stage. This TC will therefore be an instrument for students to show what they have learned in an innovative way, promoting the use of ICT in the learning process, problem based learning techniques and engage students at risk of ESL using a more innovative method. By using modern ICT hardware such as the tablets, students will also be updating their basic and transversal skills and be able to fully utilise all the communication opportunities that it will provide.\r\n\r\nA major element of the project will be the inclusion of a local media company (newspaper, TV etc) which will be part of the local schools project activities. This \"Media Provider\" will become a practical source of information for schools and also provide a tangible link for students when working on project activities. This will provide students the opportunity to connect their transversal skills that they have learned through the project with a 3rd party who will work in co-operation with project activities.\r\n\r\nEach key stage will be researched, recorded and edited in partner schools culminating in TCs which will be presented during the exchange.  The use of modern ICT methods forms a key element of the project ethos with the objective of interesting students in a natural way and increase attainment for those at risk of early school leaving.\r\n\r\nTeachers will be encouraged to share their resources, teaching strategies and experiences with their new ICT tools among their colleagues both in their local school, the wider educational community through Professional Development workshops and through the use of the social media platforms (Google+ and eTwinning) that will be utilized throughout the project.\r\n\r\nThe transnational perspective is imperative as the results can be obtained from 4 different countries through the participating partners providing a true EU overview of the subject.

Students will conduct surveys on attitudes towards global warming, transport arrangements and traffic density in their local community and compare these with other schools. They will complete scientific research projects on lichen \u201cdistribution\u201d affected by pollution and collect water samples from nearby school areas in order to compare the samples and research results with other schools. All these actions will be repeated in every school yearly after the Erasmus + project ends. \r\n\r\nParticipants will make use of portfolios (Europass) in documenting their learning processes. The project will use email, blogs, eTwinning, Twitter, a website and a YouTube channel to communicate, disseminate and evaluate activities. \r\n\r\nStudents will study national and EU policies and legislation concerning ways to promote sustainable and renewable energy solutions. They will conduct research on current developments and solutions to climate change. They will be supported in presenting their results to other schools and thus improve their IT-skills, language skills and presentation skills. The identified experts and outside partners will further support the delivery of specialist knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\nAfter developing their knowledge of global warming, students will discuss and design new ideas to fight against climate change. Entrepreneurial skills such as product planning, marketing and risk analysis will be taught to them by their teachers and entrepreneurial experts age-appropriately. A possible business idea or a prototype solution may be developed. These ideas will be presented and evaluated by other students (peer-evaluation) and business professionals and they will attempt to use feedback to develop their concept into a feasible product. There will be an on-going evaluation and feedback throughout the different parts of the project. Finally this project will be presented to the surrounding community and other schools in the area by using media and via a seminar. \r\n\r\nFor students the main aims of the project are to develop their learning skills: science skills, research skills, presentation skills, IT-skills, social media skills, communication skills and language skills as well as their awareness of climate change. \r\nThere will be a group of at least twenty students per partner school to communicate with and present the results and processes to the whole project group. Where possible, the whole school or year groups will take part in some activities during the project (such as surveys or overlapping areas of the curriculum). Activities and different parts of the project are closely connected to the curriculum of each country and school. However, the innovative approach to this curriculum will be something different from every-day school work and will be something for involved persons to remember for years. \r\n\r\nTeachers will improve their team work skills, IT and social media skills, presentation skills, innovation, creativity, knowledge of sustainable development, entrepreneurship, international relations and overall learning and teaching. Good practices in education will be shared between schools and the wider educational communities, on a local, national and EU level by disseminating innovative and effective techniques.", null, "Balwearie High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013517_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KY2"}
