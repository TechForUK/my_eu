At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community. This vision is applicable to all and will underpin all activities in order that all participants achieve their full potential.  We want to demonstrate the value that can be created when teachers give young people the practical skills to solve real challenges be.\r\n\r\nThe plan has 3 strands:\r\nStrand 1 - Upskilling Teachers, Pupils and Engaging the Community\r\nIn the initial stages of our project we upskill teachers in effective Thinking Skills in the classroom.\r\nAs this project will be largely led by pupils the next stage will be to upskill pupils in essential thinking skills.\r\nOnce trained pupils will approach members of the wider community to look at ways in which they can improve their locality and identify the skills they need in order to meet their goals.  \r\nWe have included job-shadowing and training for teachers.\r\nStrand 2- Developing Leaning & Thinking Together (LTT) schools\r\nOnce the required skill set is identified we will put into place the necessary intergenerational community training programmes in which pupils will disseminate their new skills and gaining additional skills by engaging in these events.  Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.  These events will serve as a celebration of the good practice shared but also a further opportunity to encourage other schools in our regions to engage in similar activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that by cooperating together and sharing skills, experiences and competences between the partner regions the project outcomes will be significantly reinforced.

Our young people will be facing a very different landscape for employment in 10-20 years when our youngest pupils in primary school enter the world of work. Digital skills are becoming more and more central to teaching and education policy in particularly developed countries are preparing pupils for the Digital Economy. Digital Competency/Literacy Frameworks are in place for strategic development of digital competency across schools. \r\nThis project t takes the role of digital competency to the next level and seeks to engage schools and pupils involved in innovative curricular activities and training for this 4th Industrial Revolution. The project will up-skill teachers to be confident and competent to deliver and embed the skills of programming and coding of robots.  Teachers will work alongside industry standard experts (Big Learning Company - BLC)to use LEGO\u00ae Education Mindstorms EV3 platform and programming languages such as Python. Teachers will develop with BLC experts appropriate training resources for other teachers, a training pack for pupils and creative curricular resources/parental engagement activities for teachers and pupils to use and for other to access too.  We will also carry out a baseline assessment to measure attitudes and values toward Digital Learning with pupils, teacher and parents/carers.  This is followed up by an impact assessment to measure the impact of actions and activities on the targeted group. \r\nThe impact of these Intellectual Outputs and activities developed will be also be evaluated during the project through actions such as lesson observations and feedback from users of the resources and pupil voice on their experiences of being trained as deliverers and educators. \r\nDuring the project, we will include training sessions, two pupil exchanges and four multiplier events. In the 2 distinct phases of the project our overall aim is to up-skill teachers and pupils and involve parents/carers in understanding how digital learning takes place in the school and for them to sample digital learning activities.  The finale of the project will be a collaborative and simultaneous programmed robot dance involving all partner schools using the same dance movements.

It is important to help  children to look inside and around themselves, to imagine their future through this double perspective, by beginning to know the labour marked and educational opportunities, becoming aware that the learning process is a lifelong process and that school is a part of it.\r\nAIM OF TH PROJECT: to find and experiment teaching paths that allow students, from nursery onwards, to think about their identity in order to strengthen their capacity to make conscious  choices, to take into consideration the continually widening territorial, social and cultural environment and to understand the value of completing an education or training programme. \r\nTHE OBJECTIVES of   I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE are:\r\nAugmented consciousness and competence, in teachers, related to educational guidance and guidance-oriented teaching.\r\nIdentified and developed strategies and methods to help :\r\nAll students creating connections with the world of work and with the upper secondary schools/vocational schools of the school area.\r\nTeachers to promote inclusive teaching/learning approaches for all students.\r\nTeachers to identify and develop strategies to fight gender stereotypes in teaching, learning and in professional choices.\r\nWe will address STUDENTS  by analyzing three main areas:\r\nIDENTITY AND PERSONAL CHOICES \r\nThrough teaching paths students can learn:\r\nTo think about themselves, their potential and their abilities.\r\nBecome responsible and aware of the consequences of their actions.\r\nTake responsibility and take on tasks to make our societies work efficiently.\r\nLABOUR MARKET\r\nThrough the knowledge of  local and European areas and world of work opportunities:\r\nStudents can understand how to use their own competences.\r\nTeachers can be more conscious of the world of work needs in order to help students build life skills. \r\nEDUCATIONAL TRAINING \r\nThrough the knowledge of some jobs: \r\nStudents will learn to plan educational paths that allow them to achieve their own ambitions.\r\nWe will do this in cooperation with other different agencies and specialists at local level in order to enable the adoption of a 'whole child'approach' to Early School Leaving. \r\nThe target age of the project is: 5-12\r\nAll partners are schools: some of them have already collaborated in previous Comenius partnerships with Maniago ( Turkey, Latvia, Finland, Romania UK-England) two are new entries but they have a previous experiences in Comenius Projects \r\nSome of our partner schools are already providing career guidance pathways to their students, other are focusing on self-esteem and consciousness building activities, other have not yet introduced to these experiences: trough international cooperation, sharing our good practices and building guidance pathways we want to foster all schools, together with the territorial agencies, to deepen their knowledge about early guidance and its educational value, providing teachers with a tested, structured and shared equipment of tools and resources.\r\nThe main activities of the project are: \r\nPreparatory activities , transnational project meetings and on line meetings, short-term exchanges of groups of pupils and short-term joint staff training events. During the last meeting in Italy it will be organized a dissemination seminar supported by our Region (Guidance Department) \r\nThe school activities will be developed into the following main areas:\r\n IDENTITY AND PERSONAL CHOICES consisting of self-knowledge, self-analysis and self-awareness and discovering interests and aspirations and developing initiatives \r\nKNOWLEDGE OF THE LABOUR MARKET AND JOBS discovering past and present jobs in specific geographical and social contexts.\r\n KNOWLEDGE OF EDUCATIONAL TRAINING discovering the value of educational training in order to get the job they want. In this way students learn the importance of a proper education process which in turn helps against early school leaving.\r\nTo implement the activities these methodologies will be used : cooperative learning, peer tutoring, lab teaching role playing and team work, see fit to develop key competences of lifelong learning  too. \r\nICTs have an important role in the development of this project. \r\nWith I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO BE  we aim to put in motion a concrete process to help preventing  early school leaving.

In fact, personal development requires the ability to set personal goals and the know-how to attain them: this is what entrepreneurial learning is about. It supports the general learning processes and basic skills achievement with positive effects on self-confidence, achievement orientation, perseverance, analytical ability, proactivity and creativity, and fosters cooperation, personal commitment and appreciation of individual skills and talents.It appears to be neglected, as many European countries do not provide specific training and guidance for primary teachers who are not familiar with E. education, and therefore do not set up entrepreneurial activities in their schools. WHAT\u201cKids Conquering Castles\u201d (KCC) will contribute to enhance, among teachers and school communities in the partnership, the understanding of E. as a key competence to be promoted from early education. It will provide initial and on-going training for teachers, and offer pupils and staff the opportunity to experience and share specific strategies and tools during the three project years through setting up and managing a school cooperative enterprise.International cooperation will be a key resource, bringing in cultural comparison, expertise and actual examples, and enhancing communication skills and European spirit among the participants.KCC will foster awareness about E. competence among families and community, while the castles theme will offer actual opportunities to connect school and territory pursuing strategic synergy. In the surroundings of each partner school there is a castle. The \u201cKids Conquering Castles\u201d Cooperative\u2019s aim is to organize specific activities and events for a child-oriented approach to the castles. The cooperative ethical spirit will help respond to the inclusivity needs of disadvantaged students and families. This spirit will be further highlighted by devolving the KCC Cooperative profits to a NGO, at the end of the third year. HOWAlong the project life, each year will focus on a specific theme: 1\u00b0-\u201cThe Cooperative in the Castle\u201d presenting the local castles and setting up the KCC Cooperative. All the formal steps for the Cooperative registration and management will be made within the partnership (decisions on status, name, logo and mascot, steering board and profit destination).2\u00b0- \u201cMarket in the Castles\u201d: designing, producing and selling castle souvenirs - using territorial resources and historical workshop knowledge \u2013 developing market research and advertising abilities.3\u00b0- \u201cEthical investments and Castle promotion\u201d: bringing the acquired know-how into the local, and sharing results: markets in partner communities to enhance project awareness and experience, as well as additional cooperative profits to be donated to NGO.At the end of each year, a group of students from every country, as ambassadors of their schools, will meet (in Spain, Italy, Germany) to work together in the KCC Cooperative, celebrating the year\u2019s theme and promoting the local castle in an European context. The results from the meeting \u2013 in terms of assessment and of acquired knowledge and skills - will be brought back and shared in the partnership\u2019s schools. Regular communication will allow and support cooperation and play a strategic role in the project implementation. This will be mainly ensured by the eTwinning platform - where activity and assessment tools will be shared, results documented and live meetings organized - and in the three transnational meetings, where coordinators will monitor, plan and assess the project implementation.WHOThe \u201cKids Conquering Castles\u201d Cooperative will directly involve in entrepreneurial activities 63 classes - around 100 teachers and 1450 pupils aged 6-11, in 6 European countries.  The project will impact on schools and communities, enhancing educational standards, cooperation attitudes and European citizenship awareness. Teachers will become confident in E. education, the number of specific activities in schools will increase and the entrepreneurial approach will be more broadly used in teaching, so that pupils will be trained to be active, creative and responsible for their own learning.  The project experiences will encourage further cooperation between schools and local administrations, agencies and education stakeholders; the best Kids Conquering Castles practices will be carried forth for a child-oriented use of the local castles beyond the project life. In our vision, the creativity that children will express working together within Kids Conquering Castles will encourage the communities to value and support children\u2019s role in an inclusive, open-minded and collaborative society.", "http://cyfarthfapark-pri.merthyr.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-022924_5"], ["8HA", "Autistic child in a mainstream class: resources for school staff to promote fully inclusive learning process.", "Caedraw Primary School", 91823.0, "BACKGROUND: Teachers and other school staff are facing challenges in working with autistic children on everyday basis. Sometimes educators experience difficulties in finding the best methodologies and techniques working with autistic children and integrating them in mainstream classrooms. This project is aimed for teachers and other school staff to acquire new knowledge and skills in order to be able to work with autistic and mainstream children in a way that is advantageous for both of these groups. It will not only help teachers and other school based specialists to improve learning environment but also include autistic children in mainstream collective more effectively. \r\n\r\nAIM: The aim of this project is to ensure teachers and school staff (assistants, speech therapists, social educator, special  educator and others that are in any way involved in working with autistic children) with information, techniques, methods and practical skills in order to be able to include autistic children in mainstream classes the best way possible for them to be able to gain from school environment not only curriculum but also cooperation skills, problem solving skills and to increase their communicative abilities. \r\nThis project would not only be a great support for school staff but also a contribution in autistic children education. \r\nAs different countries use wide variety of methods and techniques in work with autistic children in mainstream classes it would be crucial to look at this matter in a broader way than just one country - Latvia. The aim is to include at least five countries and exchange teachers and staff experiences in between these countries. At the end of the project a conference is being planned in Latvia, many teachers in mainstream schools who face challenges of including autistic children in mainstream classes would be provided with new resources to improve their teaching quality and overall knowledge of autism from an international experience based perspective. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS: It is being planned to include at least five partners in this project from different countries - Iceland, United Kingdom, Estonia, Slovakia and Latvia. Selection process of partners is based on their experience in the field of including autistic children in mainstream classes. Only preschools and primary schools which had previous experience and which are including autistic children in mainstream classes at the moment of applying to the project will be selected. Previous cooperation partners will also be addressed to ask them if they would like to take part in this project. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES: All partners will be asked to share their knowledge and practical skills in working with autistic children in mainstream classes through organizing short term joint staff training activities/master classes in their countries as well as participating in short term joint staff training events and master classes organized by partner organizations. Regularly project meetings will be held to plan coming up training activities, develop work sheets, questionnaires and other relevant documents for the project. \r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT: The main outcome of this project is expected to be increased knowledge of school staff, especially teachers who work with autistic children. The knowledge would include different working techniques, methods and skills in order to improve autistic children inclusion process in mainstream schools. Results will be available for society on social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, where newest information from seminars, master classes and every day project work will be published. And the main outcome will be a resource pack for educators in working with autistic children.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-LV01-KA219-035479_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF47"}
