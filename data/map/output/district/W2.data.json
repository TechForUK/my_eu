Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare.

The project brought together many different stakeholders in the supply chain, namely producers, processors, retailers, animal welfare organisations and academic experts.\n\nBuilding on previous EU initiatives in the field, the team supported welfare assessment and improvement strategies, in line with research and development (R&D) priorities in the field. It identified key welfare issues in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and fish. The partners then produced a total of 58 strategic approach documents (SADs). Each SAD focuses on a specific welfare problem and documents the likely causes and consequences, the relevant legislation, and existing best practices. It also sets short and long-term goals for welfare and economic improvement as well as prioritising future R&D. Thus, many important recommendations emerged from the project and these were prioritised for each product group.\n\nThe overall results were communicated via the project's website, as well as through press releases, newsletters and conference presentations.\n\nIn effect, the project built a powerful platform to facilitate the exchange of resources and expertise on the topic.

The Going far with European VET (GoEUVET) project has been designed to meet some of the challenges: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVocational training less valued by young people\r\n\r\nIn a recent survey, McKinsey & Company found that nearly 2/3 of the young people who participated in the study agreed that vocational training was less valued by society.  Fewer than 40% of those who said they preferred vocational work actually sought out this type of training. In Sweden, only 28% of young people apply for vocational education. At the same time, youth unemployment in Sweden is 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany companies still can't fill their vacancies \r\n\r\nThere are a large number of young, educated people available for work, but many companies still can't fill their vacancies. In the above mentioned McKinsey & Company survey, 43% of the employers stated that candidates don't possess the skills they need. Yet 72% of educators believe new graduates are qualified to land jobs in the real world. In conclusion, educators don\u2019t seem to be aware of what employers are looking for & students may have skills, but not the right ones. For instance, international experience is highly appreciated by the employers. Still few students are provided a transnational learning opportunity as part of their education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECVET \u2013 still a well-kept secret\r\n\r\nFew VET providers in Europe have discovered ECVET as a mean to quality assure learning opportunities abroad & for VET development. Too few projects utilizing ECVET in practice have been conducted making it difficult to communicate the \u2018real\u2019 added value of ECVET. ECVET also needs further investigation, eg is still a challenge for VET teachers to describe &  assess learning outcomes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAim & objectives\r\n\r\nAccording to the European growth strategy EU 2020, the EU member states should aim to deliver high levels of employment, productivity & social cohesion.  In order to respond to this strategy, a new framework - Education & Training 2020  - has been created including strategic objectives, two of them concerning mobility opportunties & VET quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the GoEUVET project is to organise transnational, transparent, transferable & recognisable learning opportunties for VET students in the Trade & administration, Hotel & turism, Car, trucks & Transport, & Restaurant sectors. The involved teachers will be introduced to ECVET & start to develop the mobility concept of the VET program utilizing ECVET. In doing so, the project aims to achieve the following important objectives in line with EU 2020, ET 2020 as well as local goals & strategies at Elof Lind\u00e4lvs gymnasium & Kungsbacka municipality related to these objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprove VET attractiveness & offer more learning opportunties abroad\r\n\r\nProviding opportunities to study or work abroad as part of a VET qualification has proved to increase the attractiveness of VET. An immediate effect of the ECVET based European classes at ELG was an increase of student applications. Transnational mobility opportunities also proved to attract more motivated students with better grades & students tend to achieve better results if they are offered an opportunity to study or do work placement abroad as part of their VET program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprove VET quality by international cooperation\r\n\r\nInternationalization is often used as a synonym to high quality when communicating VET. Still, few VET providers use this mean to increase VET attractiveness or for organizational development. However, experiences from the previous EURIAC & ECT projects proved that international cooperation indeed had positive impact on the involved VET programs, eg competence development, opportunity to benchmark one\u2019s own VET program, & increased understanding of the pros & cons of one's own & other educational systems in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReduce youth unemployment \r\n\r\nThe job profiles of the involved VET programs are highly international & students could work anywhere in the world after graduation. To create transparent & transnational learning opportunities within these sectors would therefore blaze a trail to the European labour market for the 70 students that would be involved in the GoEUVET project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the expected results, impact & long term benefits:\r\n\r\n- Increased attractiveness of involved VET\r\n\r\n- Increased number of transnat.mobility opportunities for VET students\r\n\r\n- Increased teacher readiness for international cooperation in the involved VET programs\r\n\r\n- Increased knowledge of how to utilize ECVET to organize transparent & transferable transnational learning opportunties\r\n\r\n- Improved student results & higher motivation \r\n\r\n- Decreased youth unemployment & increased EU labor mobility\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the GoEUVET project will contribute to the fulfillment of goals & objectives at ELG, Kungsbacka municipality, Gy2011, ET 2020, & EU 2020.

The Residency and Hub is a physical and social space within the community of Persborg in Malm\u00f6.  Persborg faces a high level of unemployment, single households and segregation, leading to a high level of clinical depression among residents and low sense of community. The Residency and Hub seeks to break this mould by providing a platform for residents to creatively reconstruct their community.  It serves as a social innovators residency, where social entrepreneurs from all backgrounds will live collectively--working on their own projects and jointly on community projects.  The Hub is a drop-in office and workshop where residents of the local community can develop their skills through a system of skill exchanges.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to become a solution that can be scaled to other cities with similar demographics and challenges.  Most cities, for example, have vacant lots that could act as the physical space for this solution.  The project seeks three volunteers to work with the ongoing development of the concept.  The volunteers will all be independent thinkers who have proven to be diligently competent of taking initiative. The tasks and activities range from physical development and construction of the 3000 m2 physical space to community outreach; from creative PR campaigns to event curating; from volunteering and interacting with local actors to administrative tasks.\r\n\r\nThe methodology carried out throughout the practice will be twofold.  Firstly, we will focus a lot on Human Centered Design as defined by Ashoka International.  Since much of the work involved in this process is problem-solving and solution-finding, we use human-centered design to ensure that the solutions are sustainable and relevant to the problem.  Secondly, we instill a customized team-workflow based on team-building, mutual trust and work efficient methods including Pecha Kucha and Pomodoro technique. We have found this hybrid method of working to be very effective with our current team.\r\n\r\nThrough this project we hope to see physical changes to the community of Persborg.  The hub aims to be used as a workspace for locals to craft the physical construction of the community, with the approval of the municipality and housing agency.  If locals agree, for example, that all benches in Persborg should be painted blue, we aim to act as a platform and intermediary to ensure that this can happen.  This will promote direct democracy and will begin to give the neighbourhood an identity. This project also aims to bring social change.

Apprentices and students in the fields of nursing, midwifery, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, special education and in medical technical assistance in radiology, laboratory, functional diagnostics, and surgical technical assistance are invited to participate in this project. By participating in an internship abroad, students will be able to further develop their practical skills and expertise as well as improve their foreign language and social skills. As a pool project, participation is open to all vocational students of health care specializations throughout Germany. Prerequisites for participation and application forms are available on the project website (www.dezernat4.uni-hannover.de/eu-praktika).Additionally this project offers ten teachers from the vocational schools actively involved in the network one to five-week mobility exchanges for a short training and/or teaching period abroad in educational institutions, companies or organizations active in the European health sector. Teacher mobility exchanges include teaching and/or training at a vocational school or job shadowing and/or training at a relevant enterprise or organization.Over 45 vocational schools throughout Germany are actively involved in the project partner network \u201cHealth Care Work Exchange\u201d administered by the EU Liaison Office (EU-Hochschulb\u00fcro Hannover/ Hildesheim) at the Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover. Meanwhile more than a hundred partner organizations throughout Europe, such as university teaching hospitals, private medical practices, rehabilitation centers, public and private hospitals and clinics offer such Erasmus+ internships. In addition, numerous educational institutions offer their services in securing and organizing internships in their region. Together this network aims to create a mobility project to meets students\u2019 needs for high-quality and technically challenging internships abroad. Emphasis is placed on designing internships that meet each participant\u2019s specific needs for gaining practical experience in their profession and that serve to improve social skills with regard to communication, perception and reflection when interacting with patients of different age groups and cultural backgrounds. Internships lasting from 4 to 22 weeks will provide students a means to learn more about various approaches to health care and different types of social systems, to gather new experiences abroad, and to improve their foreign language skills. In this manner, they will gain a more comprehensive understanding of their profession and improve their career opportunities. The internships satisfy the practical training requirements set up by the state ministries of education and the vocational schools, while at the same time incorporating the personal interests of the students. Thus such internships can enhance the attractiveness of vocational training mobility throughout.This project can also contribute significantly to the internationalization processes of the partner organizations. In part, the transnational exchange of knowledge and pedagogical methods can lead to modifications in vocational education and increase the level of awareness of all parties involved of the importance of lifelong learning within an intercultural context.

One of these challenges is skills needs. At the same time, it is difficult for today's providers in vocational education & training to recruit students & many programs lack quality. The project GoEUVET 2 has been initiated to address some of these challenges:Vocational training less valued by young peopleIn a recent survey, McKinsey & Company found that nearly 2/3 of the young people who participated in the study agreed that vocational training was less valued by society.  Fewer than 40% of those who said they preferred vocational work actually sought out this type of training. In Sweden, only 28% of young people apply for vocational education. At the same time, youth unemployment in Sweden is 25%.Many companies can't fill their vacancies There are a large number of young, educated people available for work, but many companies still can't fill their vacancies. In the above mentioned McKinsey & Company survey, 43% of the employers stated that candidates don't possess the skills they need. Yet 72% of educators believe new graduates are qualified to land jobs in the real world. In conclusion, educators don\u2019t seem to be aware of what employers are looking for & students may have skills, but not the right ones. For instance, international experience is highly appreciated by the employers. Still few VET students are provided a transnational learning opportunity as part of their education.ECVET \u2013 still a well-kept secretFew VET providers in Europe have discovered ECVET as a mean to quality assure non-formal learning (eg work placement) & for VET development. Few projects utilizing ECVET in practice have been conducted making it difficult to communicate the \u2018real\u2019 added value of ECVET. ECVET needs further investigation, eg it remains a challenge for training professionals to describe & assess learning outcomes (knowledge, skills & competencies) achieved in the workplace and/or live projects in cooperation with the outside world. ECVET is a suitable tool for this.Aim & objectivesAccording to the European growth strategy EU 2020, the EU member states should aim to deliver high levels of employment, productivity & social cohesion.  In order to respond to this strategy, a new framework - Education & Training 2020 - has been created including strategic objectives, two of them concerning mobility opportunties & VET quality.The aim of the GoEUVET project is to organise transnational mobility & develop a common concept for quality-assured transnational mobility so that the non-formal learning experience becomes transparent, transferable, and possible to communicate to potential employers. In this way, the project contributes to the fulfillment of a number of priority objectives at local, regional, national as well as European level.Overall objectives- Transnational mobility of students in vocational education- Concept development & quality assurance utilizing EQAVET, EQF, ECVET & EuropassActions- Introduction to the EQF, ECVET & Europass for involved personnel- Recruitment of vocational students for trans. mobility- Preparation for trans. mobility- Transnational mobility- Evaluation of trans. mobilities- Recognition of learning outcomes achieved during trans. mobility- Concept development for trans. national mobility- Project coordination- Communications & disseminationExpected results, effects & long-term benefits of the project- Upskilling (acheving extended VET competences), improved linguistic and intercultural competence, and personal development for VET students - Increased number of VET programs offering increased number of transnational VET mobility opportunities- Improved outcomes & increased motivation for VET students- Reduced youth unemployment & increased mobility regionally, nationally & at European level between VET programs/systems & labor markets- Increased attractiveness of the VET programs involved- Increased experience & preparedness for international cooperation among staff involved in vocational programs- Improved quality of the VET programs involved- Dissemination & continued experimentation on the European frameworks ECVET, EQF, EQAVET and Europass.In conclusion, the GoEUVET 2 project will contribute to the fulfillment of the aims & objectives at local, regional, national, & European level.

The project idea originates from the constant contact and confrontation with students, recent graduates, VET staff, companies, stakeholders and public and private Institutions.The strong information activity on the learning and mobility opportunities offered by European Programs, carried out at national level, through seminars, infodays and meetings, permitted  Essenia UETP srl to understand the needs of the job market and the education world as well. Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages. The partnership of the project is composed by organizations with whom Essenia has solid relationships, as well as new members, included to favour Essenia's European and international dimension.

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. This development creates opportunities as well as challenges. There are increasing numbers of skilled workers who now face unemployment, at the same time there is a gap between skills and the needs on the labour market. These challenges require restructuring and flexible solutions that demand more relevant and competent professional expertise and competences, new and innovative methods as well as an increasing need for more relevant vocational education and training.International cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.HCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2016-18 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between VET and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.HCC has been an active user of mobility programmes, and has sent a large number of VET pupils on mobilities every year. This year we also aspired, and worked strategically to increase the number of participants within staff mobility.By including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long term competence development. Teachers from work committees for vocational specific programmes (FAU), working across several schools, have also been included in this application. This will strengthen professional skills and competences, as well as being an important contributor in the dissemination of results. This year we have also made an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Giving mentors the opportunity to take part in a work placement together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. Sustainable development requires international cooperation across sectors, administrative levels and disciplines. There is a need to gain knowledge and insight into the disciplines that future businesses will require. The project has therefore placed emphasis on developing interdisciplinary group mobilities. It will increase the expertise and networks across different sectors, enhance value creation and innovation, facilitate better use of regional advantages and enhance restructuring to greener jobs. An example involving technology is a group from Nordhordaland (vocational school, business and municipality) that intends to visit Denmark to further develop the industrial foundation in Mongstad in a greener and more progressive direction.In this, and future projects, HCC will work more systematically to increase the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. HCC is applying for 37 mobility projects which count 173 pupils and apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 4 training offices, and 68 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 29 mobility projects which count 178 staff from 28 businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, agriculture, electricity/electronics, and tourism. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as entrepreneurship, green and blue growth, innovation, progressive healthcare, school administration, assessment, and cooperation between VET and businesses. As a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects. The majority of the pupils are under the age of 18, and it is important that they are accompanied while traveling to and from their host countries.

It is enormously valuable for our students at The Business and Administration programme and The Restaurant and Food Management programme to come in contact with English and international food-, service-, and business culture and obtain an insight in it; additionally learn how to provide service in an international perspective. At the orphanage, the students should mainly practice their pedagogical leadership by planning, effecting and evaluating pedagogical activities. \r\n\r\nA primary result for all participating programmes is that the students improve their English skills and acquire international and global experience. The longer term benefit of this project is to offer more students this opportunity in the future, which leads to our school, Holavedsgymnasiet, being more attractive to apply to.

Global competences and intercultural understanding can contribute to further development of civil society.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.\r\n\r\nHCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2017-19 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between education and training and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.\r\n\r\nHCC continuously aims at increasing participation among our partners.

The pedagogy of the MFR is based on the alternation internship / school, so it is quite natural that we thought to organize internships abroad. Since 2008, our school has been involved in European mobility.\r\n\r\nWe were chartered in 2010 and our 2015 accreditation application has three goals :\r\n\r\n\u2022 Develop transferable skills through an off-border internship offer\r\n\r\n\u2022 Discover different cultures\r\n\r\n\u2022 Adapt and expand professional practices\r\n\r\nThese goals are what we would describe as our \u00ab compass \u00bb. Our core business is the mobility of our apprentice learners and that of the initial vocational trainees.\r\n\r\n2 classes are mainly concerned: the apprentices in CAP and the students in second year of the BAC PRO SAPAT curriculum. Since 2008, 80% of our CAP apprentices and 70% of the BAC PRO students have benefited from European mobility. This percentage corresponds to our goals.\r\n\r\nWe will carry on this perspective with a true selection of the learners who will benefit from this mobility experience. Thus, considering the profile of the current class of \u00ab Seconde BAC PRO \u00bb, we are planning a departure for only 10 of them next year.\r\n\r\n Since 2008, destinations have been diversified: Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Portugal and next year a cross-border region of Germany (Black Forest, Bavaria) in a perspective of cross-border partnership. This diversification is interesting but requires a real extra logistical supplement. This concerns transport, accommodation, people of confidence on the spot, nothing can be left to chance with students under eighteen. That's why we are asking for 4-day accompagnying scholarships to  make sure we can supervise the start of some of our mobility experiences and a 21-day scholarship for Stockholm. This supervision is clearly requested by families. The idea of \u200b\u200bmobility is anchored as soon as the apprenticeship contract is signed or when the BAC PRO students are enrolled. However, it is necessary to rework with families to prepare the quest for autonomy. A misadventure of this last mobility (1 mobility broken after 1 day of internship without possible negotiation with the young person and the family) makes us attentive to this part of the preparation.\r\n\r\nThe other side of our international strategy is mobility for professionals. As a reminder ; 1 \u00ab Training for staff abroad \u00bb mobility was organized in 2012 for 12 professionals from the catering sector and in 2015 for 10 early childhood professionals. In addition, there were 2 individual mobilities for 2 trainers of our school in 2016 and 1 is planned in 2018.\r\n\r\nFor 2018, we are therefore requesting the possibility of setting up a professional stay for all the employees of our MFR team to discover the cross-border region of Germany, Bavaria and especially Munich. The main purposes would be the discovery of the structure of the economy and training in this \u00ab Land \u00bb of Bavaria (see programme) as well as an immersion of 2 days in a structure. This internship part will be oragnized directly by the employees themselves. The restitution of this stay will be in the form of a team building video. We are also planning to create a kind of TV show report, which could be an excellent valuation tool.\r\n\r\nTeam building makes it possible to reinforce team cohesion, that is to say, the ability of employees to move forward together to achieve a project, with the same expectations and the same investment; but also help to develop team spirit, encourage employees to support each other in tough times, and finally to optimize the distribution of workload.\r\n\r\nRegarding the valuation aspects, we are in line with our forecasts and we succeed in communicating efficiently on the Erasmus idea. Moreover, we participated in the \u00ab Erasmus Day \u00bb in October 2017.

The necessary training of the professionals involved (Cytotechs, Cytoscreeners, Biologists, Pathologists) in the different European nations is based on Courses and Masters at University level, which employ texts, fixed images of reference patterns and sessions at microscopes, in order to guarantee a reproducible recognition of structural features typical of malignant/cancer cells.\r\n\r\nDiplomas of Competence in Cytology are released by single European Nations, but a single European Accreditation Test, certifying a diagnostic ability at a standardized level would no doubt be the preferred option. In order to meet these requirement, the European Federation of Cytological Societies (EFCS) established QUATE (Quality Assurance, Training and Examination) Aptitude Test but the complexity of its organization make this test practiced by a relatively low number of applicants (approximately 50 in year 2013).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cy-TEST System aims both at delivering a training course accomplishing the needed criteria to successfully afford the QUATE test and at generating the e-QUATE, the electronic version of the QUATE test, thus reaching a more popular, cheaper and efficient impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cy-TEST Project is based on the exploitation of the Virtual Slide (VS) technology permitting a telematic transfer and navigation of scanned images of reference cytological slides. Images are stored at very high resolutions and can be viewed via Internet with proper Virtual Microscope software (eg Zoomify). These images can be used \u2013with specific tools-to realize highly interactive self assessment exercises that will improve the competence of cytotechnologists. For example exercises will show details of cells in an image, or ask to search for particular \u201cclues\u201d that can lead to diagnoses. These training cases will be accessible through the Cy-TEST system, an open access (with free registration) e-learning platform developed upon the existing open source system Moodle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project starts with the definition of the requirements for the system, the identification of suitable training methodologies and the organisation of the training contents answering to QUATE criteria and target user needs. All partners will contribute to the collection of images. \r\n\r\nAt least 1000 cases/examples will be collected, managed and stored in a dedicated repository, wherefrom to organize both an inter-active training Course and Internet-based QUATE (e-QUATE) sessions. This will allow to make training, quality assessment and continuing education of Cytologists easier, standardized and accessible.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the release of the preliminary versions of the system and of the training cases, a continuous assessment cycle (development-assessment-refinement) will be performed with real users in order to monitor usability and reliability. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt least 200 cyto-technicians will be involved in the project in the pilot phases; also 200 residents in Pathology in partner\u2019s universities will be reached. Long term impact (only focusing on the primary targets, without taking into account secondary ones) can be estimated from 12 to 15 thousands people that is the population of Cytologists working in Pathology laboratories in Europe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cy-TEST idea derives from the experience gained by the conduction of the very successful EU-funded TASTE project (www.tasteproject.eu) on the Telepathological Assessment of Histological and Cytological preparations, while its validation will be in the responsibility of the EFCS comprehensive of 28 National Societies  and with thousands of Members. \r\n\r\nBoth the coordinators of the EU funded projects TASTE and EUROCITOLOGY are partners of this proposal, thus ensuring a synergy that will allow reusability of already obtained results. \r\n\r\nThe participants to the Project are accordingly leaders in the fields of Cytology and Pathology (the Secretary and the Treasurer of EFCS, the past President of the European Society of Pathology, the leaders of the Eurocytology and of the TASTE Projects), thus ensuring a high quality level of training and an a wide exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe Cy-TEST consortium is composed of 6 organizations (4 universities, and 2 no profit institutions) all strictly directly active or connected to the cytology world and with a strong commitment for delivering higher education enhancing cytologists quality levels. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis System, which will be an integral part of EFCS activities so as to guarantee its sustainability,\r\n\r\nrepresents a move towards a technically-based improvement of quality level assurance, which is what European patients request.", "http://www.imperial.nhs.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA202-002607_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["6NB", "Ready, Steady, Grow with Virgin Start Up", "Virgin Start Up Limited", "The project develops growth potential in start-up businesses in London, particularly in areas with low levels of enterprise activity and amongst under-represented groups.
