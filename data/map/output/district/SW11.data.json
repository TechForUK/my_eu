The key motivation for this project and why we believe Europe needs a project on Context Casting is because multicasting is the key enabler that will make mobile context aware services commercially attractive. Use of mobile multicast communication especially for multimedia content has always been a very attractive proposition. There will be many situations when a multicast or broadcast will be a much more affective and appropriate form of communication service but the majority are dynamic, situation specific and consequently great service opportunities are lost. C-Cast is based on two main competence areas: creation of context awareness and multicasting technologies. Context information defines groups that demand the same information or service. These services are delivered efficiently by multicasting bearers. The project will research, investigate and define ways to use the situation/environment of a user (a mobile device) to initiate group communication. This environment mediated multicast may be triggered by an event or something in the physical environment offering a situation or context orientated service. C-Cast will provide an end-to-end context-aware communication framework specifically for intelligent multicast-broadcast services. It addresses three key issueso   Development of context and group management service enablers for context representation, context assisted group management and context reasoning.o   Definition of a framework to collect sensor data, distribute context information and manage efficiently context aware multiparty and multicast transport.o   Development of mechanisms for autonomous context driven content creation, adaptation and media delivery.", null, 4864685.0, "C-CAST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_85341_999785403"], ["4AN", "Building Innovation in the Extended Digital Chain", "Foster + Partners Limited", "The InnoChain ETN network is a shared research training environment examining how advances in digital design tools challenge building culture enabling more sustainable, more informed and more materially smart design solutions.

It is a two form entry Primary School in the borough of Wandsworth and for children aged three to eleven years old. Children at Chesterton belong to a diverse multicultural Wandsworth community in this economically deprived (39.2%  free school meals) inner-city London area. \r\n\r\nTwo thirds of pupils (62%) are EAL when they join Chesterton, speaking 36 languages. This makes Chesterton a multilingual school. It is very vibrant and multiculturally diverse. We are not diverse just because of their pupils but also because of our staff. \r\n\r\nChesterton works very close with parents and children, always providing the best teaching and care. \r\n\r\nWe are judged Outstanding by Ofsted and are a designated National Teaching School (part of the Wandle Teaching School Alliance) and a National Maths Hub.\r\n\r\nWe have a strong focus on enrichment, encouraging pupils to develop an interest in cultural activities. The nature of our school community means that many of our pupils will never leave their local area, town or country. We want to build on the enthusiasm that we have for celebrating culture and apply this to increase the European dimension. Also to offer our pupils further life opportunities, encourage travel, further future language study and access to further education and jobs.\r\n\r\nTo develop the confidence and skills of staff to take over the teaching of Spanish and create a high-quality language provision in our school, we plan to take part in a two year Erasmus+ project. \r\n\r\nAs part of this, 10 key members of staff from across the school will take part in immersion courses in Spain, one in the first year of the project and one in the second. (20 in total).\r\n\r\nThese are progressive courses with the second building on the achievement of the first and they will include learning tasks in between to maximise potential learning.\r\n\r\nThe project will reinforce key aspects of our School Improvement Plan and support our whole school ethos of celebrating cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nWe will change the structure of language teaching, moving to a more effective and sustainable model through building the skills and capacity within our staff. This will mean that we develop more cross curricular links and Spanish can be much more embedded into other subjects and reinforced through every day routines.\r\n\r\nSpanish will be taught by teachers who know their pupils and  respond better to individual needs by applying the skills and depth of understanding that they use in other subject areas and therefore.\r\n\r\nTaking members of each Key Stage and also the SEN co-ordinator will help us to better understand the needs of children at different stages of their development and learning path.\r\n\r\nThrough the involvement of 10 members of staff who will develop a high level of confidence through a series of two immersion courses we believe that we can create a great impact that will continue and multiply beyond the period of the funding.\r\n\r\nImpact on participants will include a huge increase in their linguistic ability and confidence (which will be formally recognised through Europass), much better cultural understanding and awareness of effective teaching methodology and innovative strategies.\r\n\r\nStaff will have the confidence to take a more active role in teaching Spanish and no longer be reliant on the MFL coordinator. Support staff will vastly improve their skills and confidence which will allow them to better support learners and respond to individual needs.\r\n\r\nOur dissemination plan indicates the activities that will take place before, during and after the project.
