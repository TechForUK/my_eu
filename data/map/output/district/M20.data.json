The FP6 Eurocan\\Plus project analysed the barriers underlying the increasing fragmentation of cancer research and stressed the need to improve collaboration between basic/preclinical and comprehensive cancer centres (CCCs), institutions in which care and prevention is integrated with research and education. Furthermore, it proposed the creation of a platform of interlinked cancer centres with shared infrastructures and collaborative projects to facilitate rapid advances in knowledge, and their translation into better cancer care.\n\nIn response to these challenges and in line with the call, EurocanPlatform will work towards the goal of decreasing cancer mortality by dealing with three main areas of strategic research: prevention, early detection and improved treatments. It will build the necessary resources and know-how for the entire research continuum: basic research, early and late translational research, clinical research, epidemiological research, implementation in care and population based outcome research. There will be a strong focus on discovery-driven translational cancer research in five selected tumours: breast, head-neck, lung, malignant melanoma and pancreatic cancer. Joint structures and programmes for early detection will contribute to optimal treatment, and novel prevention research programmes will integrate prevention activities in clinical cancer centres as well as public prevention. Collaborations will also include molecular pathway-driven clinical research supported by joint structures for omics, biobanking and biomarker validation to support clinical trials aimed at enhancing patient benefits by individualised treatments.\n\nEurocanPlatform is unique in its nature and represents a commitment from cancer centres to join forces and resources in order to fight cancer.", 85883.0, 12655504.0, "EUROCANPLATFORM", "Structuring the European translational research in cancer", "Cancer is one of the major health issues affecting our society and its incidence is predicted to increase globally as the population ages.

To make matters worse, the number of patients having cancer will escalate from 28 to 82 million in this period.

The programme targets the whole cancer research continuum (early and late translational cancer research) in an effort to improve cancer patient outcomes and reduce mortality. To realise project objectives, the platform focuses on three key research areas: prevention, early detection and better treatment.\n\nThe project is working on establishing a robust and sustainable infrastructure for translational cancer research \u2014 i.e. sharing resources, technologies and competences. The project has hosted two workshops on roadblocks and remedies for the use of cancer registries in translational research. The platform created a library of video materials and its education programme discussed methods for sharing educational resources among centres. These actions should ensure that quantity and quality of training is equal for all.\n\nThe consortium runs several projects in breast and lung cancer (LC). Expression data from normal breasts, benign breast lesions, ductal carcinoma in situ and breast cancer have been collected from different partners and analyses is ongoing. The ovarian cancer project completed kinome sequencing of 148 high-grade cancer DNAs and 44 matched normal DNAs. Preclincal researchers used genetics to identify potential targets to treat LC with selective c-Raf inhibitors showing promise against certain LC types with worst prognosis. Progress has been made in the development of a suitable intervention model for small-cell LC.

However it can also be attributed to the need to retain and most importantly develop researchers within the EU who have the research skills required to make a real contribution to cancer treatment. The need for quality researchers is particularly acute within the emerging interdisciplinary field of Adoptive Cell Therapy. This promising advance in cancer treatment is based on the exploitation of tumour immunology and genetic technology and built on the specific ideas and techniques originally proposed by the European and Israeli scientists who are members of the ATTRACT network. To facilitate further development within the field of adoptive cell therapy, it is crucial that a co-ordinated and intersectoral approach (combining both the research community and industry) is taken, an approach that broadens the portfolio of skills currently retained within the EU research community.

It is using image-guided and three-dimensional (3D) technology to distribute precise doses and ensure safe radiation delivery. Another major project objective is to re-evaluate the use of toxic medicines that are given in conjunction with radiation therapy, identifying at an early stage those patients who respond well to specific pharmaceutical interventions and those that do not.\n\nTo achieve its aims ARTFORCE has brought together a powerful team of radiation oncologists, dosimetrists, radiographers, physicists and nuclear medicine specialists. It is now conducting clinical trials and selecting ideal patients, i.e. those who are sensitive to standard drug treatments given in combination with radiotherapy. In this context, the project has begun conducting two separate tests, a lung trial and a head and neck trial, with early results looking very promising indeed.\n\nFurthermore, these clinical trials are supported by fundamental research in molecular biology and radiation physics. To illustrate these two fields, changes in genes and proteins predicting treatment outcome in individual patients will be investigated; while in the radiation physics area, modern imaging techniques are explored to identify the precise tumour extension and its characteristics.\n\nBased on the concept of higher yet more targeted radiation doses, the expected results are nothing short of significantly better survival rates and fewer side effects.\n\nLastly, the project has articulated more rigorous quality assurance procedures and methods to prevent radiation therapy accidents and enhance the treatment's accuracy.

She will also undertake other activities to increase her proficiency, including listening to Spanish radio programs.\r\n\r\nOur participant will produce an Action Plan the Project that is informed by the School Development Plan.\r\n\r\nWe will develop our stock of language training resources in order to support development of Spanish teaching.\r\n\r\nWe will establish a school wide approach to language leaning,  and the development of teaching methods and resources in general.\r\n\r\nThe outcome will benefit our language learning within the school and improve the learning environment of pupils.\r\n\r\nLinks will be made with a partner school in Spain and these subsequently built upon as our school expands to develop the foundation for meaningful links as our age groups expand.\r\n\r\nThe impact these courses will result in is to create a fun, rich, well resourced, authentic and engaging environment for our children to learn Spanish. By establishing links with partner schools in Spain and sharing the experience with staff, this will help to build a strong future for our Spanish provision and for our growing school.", "http://www.westdidsburyceprimary.co.uk", "West Didsbury CE Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047005_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M20"}
