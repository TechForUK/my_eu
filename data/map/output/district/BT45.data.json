Research objectives focus on key challenges in YMH: delivering new technologies to support rapid, large-scale, and early assessment, prevention and treatment.TEAM will also deliver policy directions and guidelines for technology-enabled YMH. 2 themes are covered: how can technology a) increase access, and b) help people to engage more successfully?

The ethos of the school aims to develop European citizens of the 21st Century.  \r\n\r\nIn line with the school development plan, it is intended that staff professional development through European training courses will help raise the standard of teaching and learning in the school to outstanding and that the international dimension of this project will broaden cultural awareness of the diversity in education and allow for sharing of ideas and methodologies .  \r\n\r\nThe projects focus, specifically on the idea of an outdoor classroom for teaching environmental issues in Geography should improve the experience and engagement of our learners. A Geography teacher has been identified with a desire to develop their ability to  inspire environmental awareness amongst students. At present the school has gained funding from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to develop the biodiversity of the school grounds creating a sustainable ecosystem to be used as an outdoor teaching resource. The training of a member of staff would equip the geography department with a wider understanding of how to best make use of this resource to benefit students. The project would ensure that dissemination of this practice would encourage other departments including biology to make a greater use of this resource in their teaching. \r\n\r\nPotentially, the participant will take part in an Outdoor Learning Training Course which aims to give teachers ideas and ways of harvesting \u201cthe touch of nature\u201d, the inspiration and stimulation, exploring ways to connect the person and the surroundings via learning, activities and tasks, building capacity to care for environment. Through this, links will be established with a partner school with which to communicate, collaborate and share ideas on their local environment using the E-twinning website. The participant will then develop teaching approaches and methods that connect individual learners to their surrounding environment, sharing this good practice with the Geography department, learning area and five local geography departments in the Magherafelt Learning Partnership. A key aspect of this project will be evaluation by staff and students throughout the year and at the conclusion of the in-service training by the participant.\r\n \r\nAs a result of the training the participant will have gained professional development amongst European colleagues to develop their teaching methods and approaches in relation to environmental education in the outdoors. These teaching strategies will be shared with colleagues in the Rainey and disseminated to other local geography departments, marketing the value added by staff development through Erasmus+. Through the project Geography students will have a greater knowledge of their local environment and will be empowered to participate actively in society and engage with the international dimension through their established partnerships with a European institution further sharing culture and ideas.\r\n\r\nAs the first application made by Rainey Endowed School for the mobility of school staff, it is intended that this may be rolled out to a great number of staff in the coming years both enhancing the international dimension of professional development and encouraging greater interaction with other institutions throughout Europe.", "http://www.raineyendowed.com", "Rainey Endowed School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002142_coordinator"], ["5RA", "Mindstorm to Brainstorm", "Carr's Glen Primary School", 103085.0, "Integrating practical and theoretical knowledge in primary education institutions` curricula can provide opportunities for students to gain the skills needed now and in the future on the labour market, and thus improve their future employability.

The project will provide pupils with a set of skills that they need that will enhance their future employability.  These pupils are the target group of this project as we encourage them not to be early- school leavers. This project has significant personal development impact on participating pupils, building confidence, self-awareness and self-esteem and an appreciation of individual skills and talents.  We aim to reach out to 1600 pupils within the 3 year project.

It is more than a traditional method of entrepreneurship education were the children listen to their teacher and make notes on business.  The children will be in charge of their own business- they will conduct their own market research, create surveys, graphs, analyse data, create posters and e-journals, document the process on iPads as they go, decide on a product and think about its pros and cons, they will sell the product and work out costings and profit.  The children will always be critically reflecting on their work and they complete the business process.  As a result of the project, children will be enthused about business.  They will consider owning a business as a career and to do this they will need to stay in school.  Our project addresses the issue of early school leaving and under-achievement in Mathematics, Science and Literacy and this is what makes it an innovative project.  The aims and objectives of the project are as follows:\u2022 Emphasise the importance of independent, creative and critical thinking, learning and reflective practice within a school setting.\u2022 Support teachers\u2019 delivery of entrepreneurship education within the Primary School Curriculum.\u2022 Provide teachers with an opportunity to put entrepreneurship education into practice through practical activities.\u2022 Raise awareness of entrepreneurship in pupils to identify their own unique skills and talents, recognise the value of other pupils\u2019 skill  sets and appreciate how to make the most of their combined skills and talents through teamwork.\u2022 Foster links between home, school, the local and wider community and local businesses through pupil engagement in the entrepreneurship education processes.\u2022 Instil confidence, self-esteem and independence in the pupils.In the applicant school the head teacher and Senior Leadership Team are accomplished facilitators in staff development and training in data analysis and target setting.  Best practice will be modeled and shared across all the partners through their own areas of expertise.Our results both tangiable and intangiable will be shared at local, national and at regional levels through document downloads on the shared website, through the creation of new Literacy and Maths techniques/resources, through reports sent to each partner schools National Agencies and by the mini companies and entrepreneurial products each country will set up.  The results will be increased academic standards in Literacy and Mathematics, increased skills in ICT, Science and Technology and combating early school leaving by showing how fun school can be.This project allows sustainability with the outcomes we hope to achieve.  When funding finishes we believe that the interpersonal relationships already established between staff through the preparation of this application in the partner schools will continue to develop and ensure that there is ongoing co-operation and contact.   We aim to make this project last for at least a further 2 years after funding has finished.
