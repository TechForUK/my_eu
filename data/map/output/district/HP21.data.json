The aim of the LandSense project is to build a far reaching citizen observatory for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) monitoring that will also function as a technology innovation marketplace. LandSense will deploy advanced tools, services and resources to mobilize and engage citizens to collect in-situ observations (i.e. ground-based data and visual interpretations of EO imagery). Integrating these citizen-driven in-situ data collections with established authoritative and open access data sources will help reduce costs, extend GEOSS and Copernicus capacities, and support comprehensive environmental monitoring systems. New LandSense services (LandSense Campaigner, FarmLand Support, Change Detector and Quality Assurance & Control) will be deployed in three demonstration cases that will address critical LULC issues in the areas of urbanization, agricultural land use and forest/habitat monitoring. Policy-relevant campaigns will be implemented in close collaboration with multiple stakeholders to ensure that citizen observations contribute to EU-wide environmental governance and decision-making. There will be numerous pathways to citizen empowerment via the LandSense Engagement Platform, i.e. tools for discussion, online voting collaborative mapping, as well as events linked to various campaigns involving public consultation. Simultaneously, to improve Europe\u2019s role in the business of in-situ monitoring, LandSense will create sustainable business models to support market uptake and innovation of its novel added-value products and services.", 45114.0, 5014280.0, "LANDSENSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_203269_911243318"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8PD", "Vocational Guidance and Counselling -exploring best practice to support learning", "Aylesbury College", 72315.0, "Buckinghamshire and Yalova seek to ultimately develop the knowledge and skills of young people who are preparing to leave school up to age 19 and including further education establishments so that they can make sound career choices for the future. In order to do this, there is a need in both regions to develop the skills of teachers to deliver the support required by students when considering their next steps on their career or further education pathway. Sound and informed careers guidance that prepare young people for working not only in their home country but across Europe is vital. The project will seek to develop a working relationship between teachers who are working in technical vocational settings. Using the expertise of Connexions Bucks and Research Guidance Center in Yalova, lessons will be improved to engage disaffected young people and enhance their ability to make informed decisions will be developed in collaboration with teaching staff in both countries. At the same time, the project will have 2 technical vocational insitutions; one  in Yalova which is very established and has national recognition for the work they do. Therefore, it is a great opportunity to bring colleagues together in different contexts but each with a similar challenge of supporting young people moving forward in their future education and work choice. Both educational settings have different areas of expertise and it is the intention of the project for teaching staff to support development of areas that require strengthening in each institution. Students in both countries will be included in the discussions about what they believe in career guidance should focus on from their perspective and feed their views into planned interventions. It is anticipated that once we get feedback from the survey and the professionals in the project,we have had an opportunity to discuss and debate practices in the field of career, guidance and counselling.The professionals involved in the project will develop a suite of lesson plans for use in the classroom and a guidance document for the teachers to go alongside the lessons which will be able to support young people look at their future life choices. We acknowledge that there are some good practices in both regions and to this end we intend to develop case studies of good practices which will be shared with colleagues locally, nationally and at a European level. A virtual learning environment will be set up to support deeper discussions and the sharing of materials and resources between teachers/ educators in both institutions and a website for the purpose of dissemination of the project and resources developed . What we aim to achieve by this project is a consistent method for teaching good career and guidance counselling through the development of a module of work that can be used anywhere in both Bucks and Yalova and ultimately across Europe. It is very important that the decisions a student makes regarding his future are deliberate and purposeful, that the young person would understand that adaptation to the world of business and their emotional well being  depends on the right choice. There is a need in both regions to develop good resources for teachers to use to support the choices that young people have to make when they are considering their future. Both regions are seeing a piecemeal approach to careers advise and guidance and in the UK recent reports have highlighted the lack of knowledge in schools on such matters, therefore young people are leaving school with inconsistent advice and support. The latest government guidance does not address how or what teachers should deliver in the classroom to effect making the right choice in order that students move into the right course of action whether it is pursuing technical qualifications or moving into the world of business via apprenticeships or otherwise.Development of a training event the content of which will be common in both Bucks and Yalova.", "http://www.aylesbury.ac.uk", "BUCKINGHAMSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024663_7"], ["7SX", "L'Europe moteur de progr\u00e8s: cr\u00e9ation et innovation", "Aylesbury High school", 189255.0, "he project entitled \u00ab Europe, a Force of Progress : Creation and Innovation \u00bb is intended to federate the potentials of the six partner-schools so as to enable our students to discover the European creative genius which expressed itself through innovative inventions which made the daily life of millions of people easier throughout the world and helped mankind to progress. These European inventions are part of a common cultural heritage. This project aims to establish a link with arts and literature and to enable students to discover European companies which share the best skills and the best know-how. Through school exchanges, students will have the opportunity to discover other countries\u2019 culture and civilization, to speak foreign languages and to work in multinational groups and to become European citizens open to other cultures. The project aims to recreate a positive image of Europe and reassert the importance of the European Union in a period when people lose confidence in the European institutions. The students who will participate in the project come from every social class and every ethnic origin. They are between 14 and 18 years old. We plan to set up activities of research and creation in order to stimulate the students\u2019 imagination and creativity. Students will communicate and exchange data through the e-twinning platform and our twinspace. Some work will be done prior to the exchanges, some will be done during the exchange weeks and edited on the school websites and the e-twinning platform.\r\nThis project will be organized on a three-year period:\r\nYear 1(2015-2016): The scientific, technological and cultural heritage\r\nStudents will focus on the history of inventors and inventions. They will make a card game, draw logos, collect cult objects and perform a play.\r\nYear 2 (2016-2017): The European expansion\r\nStudents create a podcast on famous inventors, create a European sandwich made with the best European ingredients, write texts about European inventions.\r\nYear 3 (2017-2018): The future stakes\r\nStudents imagine new products meant to make the daily life easier. They record commercials to advertise their product.
