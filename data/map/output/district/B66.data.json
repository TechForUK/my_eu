Secondly, it will describe security measures and process improvements to maintain or augment the efficient and secure operation of postal services to address the identified threats.\n\nAfter making an inventory of security gaps these will be developed into generic postal security models which will be integrated into a Postal  Security Target Operating Model, which will enable postal operators, customs and other relevant actors to understand how to securely exchange information related not only to security but also to the optimisation of postal flows. To support the Postal Security Target Operating Model, a Postal Security Platform will be developed that will help extending the current MEDICI effort, and will exploit developments made in FP7 projects on e-Freight and secure supply chains.

We also mean to make our students more open to the multicultural quality of today\u2019s world.\r\n \r\nWhat is more, our mobility project is strictly related to the eTwinning project we have been involved in for several years now with our two partner schools. We believe that thanks to meeting our eTwinning partners \u201cface to face\u201d we will be able to talk about what we have already achieved, to make detailed plans for the future, see the outcomes of the project and create real, not only virtual relationship with our partners. Our eTwinning project relates to the last main goal listed above, i.e. teaching values to children and improving their behaviour, as it is based on promoting moral values such as respect, kindness, honesty, friendship and family.\r\n \r\nThe project participants are a group of eight teachers who teach different age groups and different subjects but are also representatives of the management of the school and people who provide pastoral and special needs care for the students. They do not necessarily have to know English at a proficient level. The level enabling them to communicate is sufficient. All of them are characterized by the eagerness to learn and share their knowledge with others.\r\n \r\nWe plan to organize several mobilities to our partner schools, during which we plan to: outline the mobility objectives, observe the lessons and other forms of teaching as well as  breaktime in the host schools (bearing in mind the project aims), take part in staff briefing, less formal discussions with teachers, assemblies, students\u2019 performances, see the effects of the students\u2019 work, observe the eTwinning project outcomes and finally sum up and evaluate the mobility.\r\n \r\nWe will use a number of evaluation methods to monitor the participants\u2019 progress during their mobility, such as: attendance register, two kinds of observation sheets (to be filled in by the participant and to be filled in by the project coordinator) and two kinds of questionnaires (to be done by the participant and to be done by the host school teachers).\r\n \r\nWe are absolutely sure that taking part in the Erasmus + project will be a breakthrough experience for its participants and for the entire school. What\u2019s more, it will affect parents, local community and the city community thanks to spreading the news about its progress far and wide. Because of it, the foregoing groups will be more open to multiculturalism and able to see the links between our country and other European countries.\r\n \r\nWe believe that our project will also have numerous long term benefits. Thanks to it, our school will acquire the openness to change and improvement, and, hopefully, we will be more likely to take part in other European projects in the future. Also, through this experience we are bound to get more job satisfaction from our work as teachers.\r\n \r\nLast but not least, the project will be the only possibility for the students from disadvantaged families (unemployment, poverty, limited access to culture) to meet children from other countries through their teachers. Thanks to it, they will hopefully feel that Europe is closer to them and accessible. They will get hope and belief that in the future they could be linked with other European countries and they will not dread it.", "http://www.st-philips.sandwell.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PL01-KA101-049245_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B66"}
