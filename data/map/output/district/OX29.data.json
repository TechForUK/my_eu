Cost effectiveness analyses will be undertaken in multiple settings, geographical regions, and for different gender and age groups to guide integrated policy making to reduce the harm done by alcohol. Using time series analysis, longitudinal intervention research, policy mapping, cost effectiveness analyses, and other policy relevant research methodologies, recent and current alcohol policy changes will be evaluated throughout European Member States. Current alcohol policy related infrastructures will be documented and their impact on effective policy development and implementation analyzed. The interaction between social and cultural determinants of alcohol policy and policy and preventive measures will be studied to determine the extent to which the implementation and impact of effective alcohol policies is culturally determined. Methodologies will be developed to allow tools for benchmarking and comparative analysis at the European level, advancing the state of the art in alcohol policy research and enhancing cooperation between researchers in Europe and other geographic regions to promote integration and excellence of European research in alcohol policy.

Hybrid process development must be performed for each material to be welded, with the main focus in this proposal being on austenitic stainless steels and C-Mn steels. By developing and integrating sensors that monitor weld quality and allow process modification, the project will increase the quality and productivity of European pipe manufacture beyond the state of the art, enabling it to overcome foreign competition which is particularly increasing from countries outside Europe like India, China and Turkey.  Problems facing tube manufacturers include, production of too much scrap product due to process inconsistencies, lack of on-line quality control, inconsistent equipment operation, inconsistent joint preparation and presentation, lack of productivity and reliance on the skill of operators to change process parameters to maintain weld quality.  Last but not least, explicit consideration will be given to health, safety, environment and quality issues, by ensuring that where physical interaction with the process is required, the risks to operators, environment and product are minimised. The automation of monitoring and the adaptation of the welding process accordingly, will ensure a better product quality.

However, the simulation of, for example, high-pressure gas cylinders, the moulding of plastics or the thermodynamic properties of hazardous materials requires enormous computing power and specialised software tools and services. Generally, large companies, which have a greater pool of skills and resources, find access to advanced simulation easier than SMEs which can neither afford expensive High Performance Computing equipment nor the licensing cost for the relevant tools. This means that SMEs are not able to take advantage of advanced simulation, even though it can clearly make them more competitive. The goal of Fortissimo is to overcome this impasse through the provision of simulation services running on a cloud infrastructure making use of High Performance Computing systems also making appropriate skills and tools available in a distributed, internet-based environment.<br/>Fortissimo will make advanced simulation more easily accessible, particularly to SMEs, through the realisation of a 'one-stop shop' where hardware, expertise, applications, visualisation and tools will be easily available and affordable on a pay-per-use basis.

REFORM is identifying ways to reduce the waste, energy and water consumption, and health risks associated with raw material mining, production, and eventual disposal or recycling. \n\nTo date, REFORM has surveyed industry partners to determine specific needs and opportunities for enhancement. Examples include production 'bottlenecks', points in the process with low eco-efficiency, and potential recycling solutions. \n\nREFORM is exploring two specific production technologies aimed at reducing energy use and scrap waste: laser-assisted and augmented reality. Researchers are also investigating abrasive water jet technology as a more efficient method for trimming and cutting composite components.
