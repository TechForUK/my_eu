CAP4Access helps integrating disabled communities into society (social sustainability), saving public resources e.g. by helping municipalities to focus expenditures (economic sustainability) and also saving natural resources e.g. by facilitating public transport use (ecological sustainability). The project will develop tools and methods for (a) tagging, describing and discussing locations and routes within the built environment according to their accessibility; (b) visualising the data in ways which are intuitive and highly attractive; (c) route planning and navigation; (d) creating awareness and preparing effective measures at local level for eliminating barriers.

In addition, practical tools for web-based reporting were developed and implemented. \n\nTo improve current pharmacovigilance efforts, guiding principles for detecting, analysing and preventing medication errors were established. MONITORING MEDICINES then encouraged national pharmacovigilance centres to use the information collected to deepen their understanding of adverse incidents. One aspect of this work included developing methods for identifying sub-standard products.\n\nAnother goal was to help health care workers and the public retrieve information about ADRs related to HIV/AIDS treatment. By merging HIV ADR data from several sources into a common database, the team was able to develop tools for estimating ADR risks of individual patients.

Together, they are analysing OA publishing to improve understanding of the marketplace as well as the opportunities and risks involved.\n\nThe project team has prepared a survey which is being deployed on a large scale among scholars in the European Research Area and beyond. They have outlined ways to measure the penetration of OA publishing and analysed what exactly lies out there in terms of research material.\n\nThe team scanned over 4 000 journals, recording their publication volume and other relevant information such as their business model and copyright policy. The analysis was launched first using the authoritative Directory of Open Access Journals before moving on to other important sources.\n\nA review of open source material and mechanisms online revealed that the 'hybrid open access' model was the most successful and viable one, particularly in the case of science and research. This means the material is not totally free and available to all, but requires some subscription.\n\nMany important findings have emerged from this project, although still preliminary. The project team found that about 8\\;% of the worldwide production of scientific papers is published OA, i.e. about 120\\;000 articles per annum out of the estimated industry figure of 1.5 million. Five publishers run most of the OA journals, and seven publishers publish most of the OA articles, effectively dominating the market. The hybrid model has a market penetration overall of a fraction of a percent, but a success of around 2\\;% in journals which offer this option. Also, around a third of OA publishers do not use Creative Common Licenses, but actually require a copyright transfer.\n\nThe largest publishers, measured by number of journals and articles, use an article-processing-fee business model.

Why a new identity? Because this is a new school, in a new neighbourhood, with mixed population , which forced us to review constantly our working plans. We were pioneers in cooperative and task-based work, to improve our students results, as they are from different socio-economical origins. They have lots of problems to find resource so we decided to change our methodology.\r\nNow, educational laws are about to change and we need to increase our school objectives. Since two years ago, all teachers are focused on integrated language teaching. We live in a bilingual region and in addition to that, English is becoming stronger at school. Thus, we have designed a new multilingual school in which then three languages can be used in specific moments, focusing on language use rather than language teaching.\r\nWe want to improve our students communicative skills so we need to offer our students situation to use all languages. This is not a problem with official languages, but now we need to reinforce English language as an international communicative tool\r\nWe must offer our pupils the possibility to use English at school, and this is only possible if it is the teaching language. \r\nSince year 2012/2013 we have been developing several CLIL experiences at different levels (pre-primary and primary) and in different areas (assembly, project, science, art, P.E. etc) The results were really good and we decided to continue the same system. So, this year we are teaching in English some P.E. And art classes, and we would like to go on with the programme next year.\r\nThe main problem to develop this change at school is the English level of teachers. Most of them are not able to speak English in their classes with an appropriate quality level. For this reason, our  lifelong learning project states that all teachers should improve our English level, as well as  the use of different resources and strategies to integrate English in their classes in a natural way.\r\nErasmus + offers us the opportunity to improve the quality of our education through teachers courses. For this reason, in this first edition, our K1 project is going to focus on improving communicative and teaching competences. \r\nParticipants belong to different school levels, so the expected impact and diffusion will be wider. Also, they are active teachers who are cooperating with the project design from the first moment. \r\nThe activities have been selected according to the initial English level and to the different needs. Thus, the English teachers have selected courses about creative methodology and professional development. On the other hand, primary and pre-primary teachers have chosen courses focusing on speaking skills.  We think it is very important because they need to feel comfortable and sure when using English at school, and they need to offer a good linguistic reference tom their pupils to assure a quality education.\r\nWe are also interested in getting closer to European countries through cooperative projects. If teachers improve their English level, they will feel better participating in this kind of projects, such as those in eTwinning platform.\r\nAbout our partners in this European adventure, we have chosen 2 companies with a lot of experience in English teaching and teacher training. Selected courses, from  5 to 10 day, have been chosen according to their content and to the required English level  . We have also taken into account the location of the courses, Dublin and London, as travelling there is easier and they offer lots of possibilities to enjoy every moment during the stay.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, we would like to highlight that the main objective of this project is improving teachers communicative competence and, as a result of that, also the students one.

The first is to provide additional professional skills to our teachers.  The courses focus on creative methodology and business English. The participants will be trained in current innovative teaching methodologies, use of the current teaching and supplementary materials, creative and alternative approaches to teaching, in the skills to teach English for special purposes (business).

The course \"How to train teachers\" will allow us to work with our lecturers to ensure their continued education, to link the needs of the schools, of the clients with teachers' performance and lessons. The second activity is coaching and NLP, which represents a new and modern way of working with students based on empathic understanding, effective communication to maximize the students' potential, leading to better results and increased motivation. Both activities are in line with the latest trends in education that emphasize a humanistic approach to the student and the need to adapt the education to students (not students to the education plan).The knowledge and skills acquired by the teachers will be applied practically in the form of new courses, improved methodology, in creative work with teaching and supplementary materials to provide the student with more interesting and effective classroom hours. Their contribution to the development of the school will be optimized in the school\u2019s curricula with the teachers able to provide a wider range of courses and actively participate in the training of colleagues through mentoring.

The London internship increased, according to the response of the Day of Open Door in December 2017, the attractiveness of vocational training and the interest in getting high-quality vocational and communication competencies at our school. Last but not least, the image of school has improved, as well as the motivation of pupils from lower grades to acquire vocational and linlinguistic competencies in order to take part in a similar internship. We are convinced that the implementation of this project and its further repetition will clearly increase the chances of our pupils to succeed in the labour market while also attracting other potential candidates to study at our school.", "http://www.centralschool.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SK01-KA102-045975_10"], ["6AE", "Capital Calling", "European School of Economics - ESE Insight Ltd", 62854.0, "Ursulinen Mechelen is offering the project \u2018Capital Calling\u2019 to Business Support students in their final year to give them the opportunity to spend a whole school year working on internationalization. The icing on the cake is a two week internship in London or Edinburgh during which they will be able to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired during their course in a different but authentic environment and using a foreign language. This will present our students with the opportunity to push their boundaries and it will also motivate them to fully commit to their final year. Many vocational education students in Office Administration are starting to lose interest in school towards the end of their secondary school education and we feel this opportunity will give them an exciting final year to look forward to, work towards and complete successfully. \r\n\r\nIn order to be considered to take part in the project, students must show that they are motivated, social, open to experiencing different cultures, prepared to spend two weeks abroad and aware of the added value of the opportunity they are given.\r\n\r\nIn the lesson schedule of their final year provision will be made for one seminar lesson per week during which students will become acquainted with the language and culture of the internship locations.\r\n\r\nThey will study life in the United Kingdom, in particular in London and Edinburgh. They will learn about the language, the food, the location, the customs, the currency, tourist attractions, etc. In addition, they will also be prepared on a personal level and will be taught many life lessons: communicating effectively, living together, resolving conflicts, planning, organising, improving their independence by living and traveling in a foreign city and in a foreign language which in turn will strengthen their social skills. This will enable them to achieve many curriculum specific goals (giving a presentation, researching information, self-evaluation, peer-evaluation, etc.) as well as more overarching educational goals. Concrete examples include lessons in communicating (British small talk), budgeting, resolving conflicts. They will visit the British shop in Everberg and take a cooking workshop. They will research specific information about their destination, as well as suitable accommodation and transport options. They will complete a Europass CV and Language Passport. They will make a short video highlighting their motivation for the project and they will clarify this in an interview in front of a jury of teachers and external experts. They will write a weekly blog detailing their most interesting experiences. They will write an assessment of their internship experience and will present their experiences to the students who will come after them.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the school year is the two week continuous internship in either London or Edinburgh where students will apply and strengthen the knowledge and attitudes acquired at school and where they will execute the tasks of an administrative assistant in an international context: making telephone calls, welcoming visitors, classifying documents, handling correspondence, conducting sales consultations.\r\n\r\nThis will enable them to demonstrate a number of general and professional attitudes, such as punctuality, orderliness, politeness, adhering to dress code, self-reliance, self-confidence, motivation, pushing their boundaries. They will practise the language and experience the culture of their destination in diverse ways. They will become acquainted with company culture in the United Kingdom and will learn to execute the daily tasks at their internship in ways which refine and extend their job specific competencies. In this way they will greatly improve their future job opportunities, they will get a taste for moving around Europe, and they will become aware of their European citizenship. The teachers who accompany them will also benefit by updating and expanding their course specific knowledge, improving their English, strengthening the relationship with their students, establishing contacts with internship companies and expanding the project network.\r\n\r\nIt is our expectation that this will enable us to attract new students to the Office Administration course and to expand the foreign internship to all students in Office Management and Communication year 6. In addition, we are establishing by means of a poll whether some of our teachers are interested in either job shadowing or undergoing further training abroad with a view to making a fresh proposal next school year for teachers within school education. We are also setting up a task force looking at internationalisation in order to join forces and get more fellow teachers involved. In the long term, we are seeking to expand this task force within the KITOS consortium of schools.", "http://www.eselondon.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA102-046705_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3JH", "I.I.R.
