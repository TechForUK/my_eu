The work placement will last for either four or six weeks and will be organised with our European partners in currently six countries. The students do not only experience and extend intercultural, social and language skills but additionally achieve and broaden job related knowledge and skills in the field of social work.\r\n\r\nEvery day, the future educators and child care assistants are challenged to perceive multicultural situations with positive and negative effects in their daily actions and to react sensitively and respectfully accordingly. They have to be open for intercultural learning processes and encourage and assist in intercultural learning processes. The mobility project helps the participants to experience the situation of \u201cbeing foreign\u201d firsthand. Furthermore, the professional experience is important: in every country, care, education and upbringing of children and young people are organised differently, and different educational attitudes and their corresponding concepts and frameworks are to be experienced. The differences can be dealt with personally and can be integrated into the professional work instantly. By organising the work placement for at least three weeks in institutions of social work and youth welfare services and the intensive reflection it is guaranteed that the students gain more than just superficial impressions that might be based on prejudices. They are forced to deal and cope with incidents intensively, ask questions, perceive and solve conflicts and question their own (pedagogical) posture.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the stays in currently six different countries are organised and attended by the  Team Europe of the Anna Warburg School in Hamburg and the locally in a cooperating country. Supported by our partner institutions in Europe, the matters of accommodation, applications for work, the attendance at a language course and mentoring are dealt with by a local partner in the foreign country. In a preparatory seminar in Hamburg (in cooperation with \u201cArbeit und Leben e.V.) the trainees are briefed for their stay abroad.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, expected results are that the participants get to know the culture, the daily life and in particular the daily child care system in a foreign country. They will know the training and different work fields of another EU-country and compare them to German standards; additionally they reflect their own views and attitudes. The participants are going to experience certainty in using another language and discover new ways of communication. Another goal is the Europeanisation in the participants\u2019 minds.\r\n\r\nSix stays abroad are planned for the participating staff of the Anna Warburg School. While being abroad, the focus is put rather on the organisation of the students\u2019 stays, needs of the employers, the daily life in the social and welfare institutions than to work directly in the childcare institutions. The staffs\u2019 experiences have to be reflected with own ideas and attitudes. Beyond country borders contacts are made and maintained.

Future educators, nursery nurses, care workers, apprentices in the hotel and hospitality trade will travel abroad to improve their intercultural, vocational and language skills. \r\nProject aims: The aim is to increase the European mobility of future employees. Things that we have in common and things that are different in the respective countries are the topic of ensuing discussions. Automatically, the foreign language skills, the social competences as well as the personal and vocational skills will improve. Many former participants said that they realized that also their professional skills are  international. There has been a lively exchange of methods and ideas with regard to activities with children in the nursery school which increased the self-confidence of participants as an equal partner for the British colleagues. Number and profile of participants: approx. 86 participants. Of those 20 future educators, 6 erasmus pro longterm work experience, 15 nursery nurses, 27 apprentices from the hotel and hospitality sector, 10 students who train to be careworkers for people with special needs, 8 teachers of English as a foreign language and technology teachers are scheduled to participate. \r\nActivities: Vocational work placements in nursery schools, in restaurants and kitchens and practical training sessions in the colleges of our project partners, as well as immersion courses for our EFL teachers.\r\nProject management: many years of experience with similar projects, constant improvements after evaluation and feedback with our partners.\r\nExpected results/effects/longterm benefit: Our vocational college will benefit with regard to its profile compared to other schools. The work placement abroad will provide additional qualifications for our students, it will improve language skills, and practical work experience which is an additional asset on the European job market. It also improves the staff qualification with regard to intercultural skills, the European dimension, language competence, teaching methods, CLIL-skills and to expand the network of international partners. It also improves the profile of our vocational school and the participating partners in the dual apprenticeship sector of hotels and restaurants in our area. Without the Erasmus+ programme many of our students would not be able to gain this work experience abroad.
