A key barrier identified was the lack of knowledge of employers in relation to the characteristics of people with Autism and the workplace adjustments which may be necessary to have an inclusive workforce.  In line with the United Nations Convention of the Rights of people with Disabilities Article 27 it is essential that we include people with Autism in an open work environment, therefore it is imperative that employers receive the necessary training and knowledge to enable them to employ people with Autism.\r\nThe aim of Project ABLE is to enhance the employment of people with ASD through improving the quality of knowledge and understanding of the employers via a new and innovative Vocational Education and Training (VET) learning offer.\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\u2022 To ensure partner organisations agree and sign full project implementation contracts month 3\r\n\u2022 To conduct and complete an Employer Attitudinal Review within the first 9 months of the project \r\n\u2022 To conduct a Peer Analysis of the existing training courses within  9 months of the project \r\n\u2022 To develop and design a training course and resources for employers by month 12 \r\n\u2022 To adapted/customising the training course for 4 partner states month 15 \r\n\u2022 To agree minimum standards for delivery and system for quality control for the Training material within  the 2nd year of the project\r\n\u2022 To test the training course with at least 10 employers in each of the partner states (40 employers) month 18 \r\n\u2022 To further adapt the training materials based on the result of the testing month 20 \r\n\u2022 To produce a final training material and training resources  month 22\r\n\u2022 To appoint an external evaluator to undertake an interim (Year 1) and final (Year 2) Evaluation Report \r\n\u2022 To agree and implement a European and National Dissemination and Exploitation  Strategy initiated with in the first 6 months of the project\r\n\u2022 To agree a sustainability strategy  with in the 1st year of the project\r\n\u2022 To hold 6 Project meetings months 1, 6, 9, 12, 19, 24.\r\n\r\nThe main target group are Employers wishing to select, recruit and maintain people on the ASD spectrum in the open labour market.\r\n\r\nEuropean statistics( www.eu-aims.eu/autism-spectrum-disorder-asd ) states that 1% of the European Population are on the Autistic Spectrum.

In 2014 the partners were involved in organising Screenagers international seminar.  The seminar highlighted the innovative practices in ICT use in youth work and the learning outcomes for young people. However, the seminar also highlighted the challenges and identified needs for the youth sector. There is a resistance to ICT use in youth work due to fear around child protection issues, lack of competency by youth workers and lack of common policy on the issue of ICT use in youth work. Gaps in regional and national policy for the youth sector and gaps in implementation of European policy were also identified as an overarching challenge.  \r\n\r\nThe project rational is in line with the objective of the Erasmus+ programme: \u201can increased level of digital competence [and] more strategic and integrated use of ICTs\u2026by education, training and youth systems.\u201d (pg 93-94, Erasmus+ Programme Guide, 2014).  The objectives of this project are directly linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.  One of the main aims of DAE is enhancing digital literacy, skills and inclusion and the need to equip young people with the right skills to enable them to succeed in the labour market. In Ireland, it is highlighted as an aim in national policy in the Better Outcomes Brighter Futures publication. \u201c [To] support initiatives in out-of school settings, to teach children knowledge and skills relating to information management, new technologies, coding and digital literacy\u201d (Better Outcomes, Brighter Future, pg 69) The government commits to enhancing digital literacy of young people to build their skills and increase their employability and safety online. However in the national policies of some partner countries there is a focus on formal education in relation to ICT use and young people. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to focus on strategic partnership development and research. The project involves five partners The National Youth Council of Ireland, The Youth Council for Northern Ireland, Verke, National Development Centre for Online Youth Work in Finland, wienXtra from Austria and the Center for Digital Youth Care in Denmark.  \r\nIn order to achieve the objective this project aims to produce an international research report, a synthesis of the five national reports. The partners will agree on the research questions and develop a standardised research design and carry out research at a national level with youth organisations, youth worker and young people. We plan to use a variety of methodologies such as focus groups and an online survey to ensure the inclusion of diversity of organisations, youth workers and young people in the research and a wide scope. \r\nThis research report aims to address the lack of information on use of ICT \r\n\uf0d8 Map the use of ICT, digital and social media in youth work\r\n\uf0d8 show best innovative practice\r\n\uf0d8 the outcomes of the use of ICT, digital and social media in youth work \r\n\uf0d8 the challenges and barriers to use of ICT, digitial and social media in youth work \r\n\uf0d8 identity examples of how these challenges have been overcome\r\n\uf0d8 identify training available for the youth sector\r\n\uf0d8 identify  recommendations for training needs\r\n\r\nSuch information will help to highlight gaps in practice and will also inform policy in the area. It will also benefit the wider sector and a broad range of stakeholders in the public and private sector. The expected impact of this project is on the partners involved, youth workers and youth work organisations involved, young people and policy\r\n\uf0d8 Raise awareness of the potential of ICT use in youth work.  \r\n\uf0d8 Increased awareness among policy makers of the value of ICT use in youth work.  \r\n\uf0d8 Evidence on which to base policy systems \r\n\uf0d8 Inspire youth workers to engage in ICT in youth work with the aim of increasing young people\u2019s engagement in youth work and their digital literacy.  This increase in digital literacy will in turn increase the skill set of young people and their employability.  \r\n\r\nThe project outcomes will be disseminated widely nationally and at a European level.  There will be a dedicated website. The partners hope to use the research outcomes to inform future projects. \r\n\r\nResearch shows young people are using ICT, digital and social media. This cannot be ignored by youth work due to lack of knowledge, investment or fear. There is a difference between a young person using ICT and being digitally literate. Youth work can assist young people in becoming digitally literate and to use ICT to its potential, to their advantage and safely.
