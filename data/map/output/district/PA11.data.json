The Berufsf\u00f6rderungswerk K\u00f6ln gGmbH assists them in finding a new job perspective; legally this is regulated by the social code IX (Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben). Our services are vocational orientation, preparatory courses, education and retraining \u2013 all exams are held before the Chamber of Industry and Commerce or Chamber of Trade as a regulated training program/education by law - support for the integration in the job market and medical, psychological and social care. The Berufsf\u00f6rderungswerk K\u00f6ln gGmbH is one of 28 facilities of the vocational rehabilitation system in Germany. With our project - Go BFW Cologne - vocational rehabilitation thinks out of the box! -  we would like to enable  our participants, our employees and our co-operating external partners on the one hand to be able to meet innovatively the growing demands on the job market and to give possibilities for the improvement of foreign llanguage knowledge as well as an offer to gain intercultural working experience. On the other hand we want to make sure that also socially and/or healthwise disadvanted people - like so many others in education and training \u2013 can gain valuable working experience abroad during their vocational education within a setting that suits their needs. \r\n\r\nThis will strengthen their self-confidence and motivation and also it will improve their vocational mobility. In this frame we will enable 35 participant and 21 employees and also external partners who are involved in the rehabilitation process with guidance and coaching regarding vocational orientation to do an internship (e.g., in the business area) or a hospitation/jobshadowing in Scotland or the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThere is not a classical profile among our participants. Nevertheless, one could distinguish two profile situations: 1. a young person who was homeless before, socially disadvantaged, a school drop-out,  a psychosis was released by drug abuse. The young person was stabilised in former projects (social situation and also the health situation). The person got the chance to orientate him-/herself regarding a vocational career and now he/she starts an education as a storekeeper. 2. a life-experienced person, in the mid 40's,  secondary education completed, very work experienced, e.g., truck driver who has lost both legs after an accident, he sits in the wheel chair now and and does a retraining as Logistics expert working in the office.  He misses his former occupation, it is hard for him to learn again, he is unsure whether he will find employment at his age again and posesses of little or no knowledge of English or intercultural working experience. \r\n\r\nOur project is also directed at our graduates who were not able to find a job right afer their graduation (or within a max. 10 months afterwards). \r\n\r\nThe BFW K\u00f6ln aims, primarily, at an effect at a local / regional level. We would like to benefit as an organization from this project by improving our quality. We want to make sure that we will reach our goals in the reintegration to the jobmarket of our participants. Offering these internships will ensure that we keep track with the developments of the European job market and that our graduates can compete in the job market.. Regarding the intended presentation of our project results to the Federal Association of German Berufsf\u00f6rderungswerke we also intend to further develop the vocational rehabilitation system at the national level further. \r\n\r\nWe expect that the employability of our participants is going to be  improved by this project. This will be shown by a higher level of self-esteem and also in a higher flexibility regarding the location of work and also by their improved foreign language skills. We expect that the work of our educational staff will further improve in quality by this project; we will be ready to react to new trends quicker.  We also want to keep the motivation of our employees high. The program will also help our staff to improve their own flexibility in order to keep track with the constant changes in the labour market. \r\n\r\nThe project realisation is steered centrally by the co-ordinator to all internally involved personnel , to the participants and also to the partners in Scotland and the Netherlands.", "http://www.quarriers.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001885_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PA11"}
