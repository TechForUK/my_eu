We collegially chose 4 classes with different training characteristics Hotels-Catering and Sales, to allow them a better professional integration or to pursue their studies. As part of the European sections, the choice of languages fell on English and Spanish, which are the languages taught in our high school. These languages are the most widely used in business and represent an important communication medium, particularly in European companies; moreover they\u2019re currently used in nearly all the professional sectors and particularly the ones we chose.\r\nThe mobility project plans an immersion in 3 host countries: the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain, divided in 3 fluxes. \r\nThe mobility concerns 33 young people facing educational difficulties, very motivated to integrate the program because they have heard testimonies of students already back from mobility.\r\nIn order to respect the regulatory requirements of the A-level in each sector, the Business students will stay for a 4 weeks traineeship in business premises the students from Hotel/Catering 8 weeks in the kitchen or the dining room. The mobility period will include a professional immersion in a company, a host family, and also cultural visits.\r\nLanguage courses will be strengthened before the departure, the OLS platform will prevent us from extra courses in the host country.\r\nThe mobility takes place within the framework of the educational and professional career during his 3 years formation and will take place between the second and the third year.\r\nThis project, common for our 2 sectors, allows us to ensure equity and cohesion between students who, even though they made different education choices, will be able to live a similar experience.\r\nWe have implemented a project methodology, with the establishment of a steering committee, whose purpose is to impulse, conceive and create management and evaluation tools, to select the classes and the students who will benefit from mobility. This organ will meet regularly to anticipate the problems on the ground, find solutions, meet the partners, and organize the logistic and, at the end, disseminate the actions, identify the impacts, and then assess the projects in its entirety.\r\nThe expected results are evaluated in 3 dimensions: \r\nFor the students : \r\n- Discovery of cultural diversity,\r\n- Struggle against school dropout,\r\n- Development of the cultural openness in a professional framework,\r\n- Improvement of the language skills during a traineeship,\r\n- Help to social inclusion.\r\nFor the teachers : \r\n- Investment to implement innovating teachings,\r\n- DNL certification, hard to obtain,\r\n- Fight against the absenteeism in their classroom,\r\n- Insertion in a new project methodology,\r\n- Closer collaboration with the mobility actors,\r\n- Motivation to train themselves in Europe.\r\nFor the High School : \r\n- Promotion of a new learning method for students with difficulties, frequently coming from lower socio-economic classes, which will help the school dropout,\r\n- Implementation of a real intern synergy, amplified by the mobilities organization,\r\n- Creation of an internal project\u2019s dynamic,\r\n- Innovation in the field of educational methods and in the curricula for a better professional integration of our students.\r\nAnother element deserves to be underlined, a strong network of professional partners abroad, welcoming our students in their hotels, restaurants or trade companies, which are growing increasingly rich professionally, culturally and humanly.\r\nOur prime concern is also to maintain the European cohesion by a deep conviction that a successful professional insertion for the youth must pass through the mobility in Europe.\r\nThis project will contribute to give an European dimension to our high school, but also to all our European partners in Spain, Latvia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Kazakhstan.\r\nIn a long-term view, the project will benefit to young people from all the participating structures, in this way it will have a multiplier effect.\r\nFor the long-term potential benefits, we\u2019ll bring to the fore a better adaptability to a professional environment always changing and an openness to the world from a personal perspective for the learner.\r\nThe ongoing assessment of our project is an additional advantage to improve the quality over the years.\r\nFrom one year to another our project methodology is improving.", "http://www.worldchoice-education.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046656_2"], ["5AR", "Hacia una mejora de la empleabilidad de estudiantes de Formaci\u00f3n Profesional.", "World Choice Education Ltd", 43032.0, "VET-EMPLOY is a placement project KA1 aimed at FP (vocational training) students (4 weeks) and teaching staff (2 weeks). The project was born from the collaboration of 4 schools that make up a consortium and teach vocational education (medium level) in the Region of Murcia. The common objective of the project is to improve the quality of teaching offered since these activities motivate students and provide them with the opportunity to improve their English as well as facilitating their access to the labour market.\r\nCompletion of this placement project will provide great benefits to the students, to the teaching staff and to the participating centres of the consortium. With respect to the students, it provides them with the opportunity to gain practical experience in a company in the United Kingdom which will motivate them in their studies, reduce school dropout rates and failure at school.  It also allows them to apply their technical knowledge gained from their studies and acquire new knowledge and skills which will provide them with a wider and international vision. They will also gain traversable skills, develop aptitudes and personal competencies such as adaptability, innovation, entrepreneurship, personal and professional skills. This will be thanks to the cultural differences obtained from living in another country and in a different social and economic environment in addition to having to problem solve on a daily basis. They will also improve their English skills which will allow them to have a quick and efficient incorporation into the labour market.\r\nWith respect to our teachers, the possibility of participating in a placement project in the form of job shadowing will contribute equally to increase their motivation as well as improve the quality of their teaching. This will be translated into an improvement in the quality of teaching offered at the centre. On the other hand, the collaborations established in the development of the project and through the placement will allow the generation of communication networks at a regional and international level facilitating future projects and collaborations in this and in other areas.\r\nEach centre has a placement delegate that coordinates with the other centres and the coordinator of the consortium to guarantee the optimum development and operation of the project. Meetings will be held by different people from the placement project from the start to create a communication network and distribute organisation, management, tracking and campaigning responsibilities.\r\nThe consortium also counts on intermediary partners based in the Region of Murcia and in the UK (Bournemouth) which will help with the practical aspects of the programme (searching for residencies, pedagogical, cultural and language training, support upon arrival at the destination country, personalised tracking of the students etc.)\r\nThe information from the VET-EMPLOY (Higher Level Vocational Education and Training Programmes) has been made available for all students and vocational education teaching staff as well as for other groups in the centres. The process of selection will be conducted clearly and transparently.  Once students are awarded a placement, several tutors will be made available to them who will ensure their optimum development and create a fluid and constant personalised level of communication.\r\nEach centre will promote the project from the moment that they created the consortium until its completion. This will be on a local and a regional level (using the internet, social networks, press and or the radio).\r\nUpon completion of the placement, the students will receive a series of documents confirming their experience such as the Europass Certificate and the Internship Certificate which can be attached to their CV demonstrating the capacities acquired as well as actual jobs completed to increase their chances of incorporation into the labour market. The consortium will evaluate the results of the project, the campaign and complete a self evaluation that will allow the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the project with the overall aim of improving future exchanges and collaborations. The long term objective is the recognition of these centres as reference points for vocational training in the Region of Murcia and to ensure quality teaching and professionals. This is in addition to national and international recognition by companies that accept professionals trained in our centres.", "http://www.worldchoice-education.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049549_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5BH", "BH LIVE ENTREPRISES LIMITED", 63119.0, "Fostering the development and implementation of the Union\u2019s integrated maritime policy (11.06.61)", "fts_2017_53054", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH2"}
