Now that the National Curriculum is changing in both Key Stage 2 and 3, this will have a strong impact on the teaching of Modern Foreign Languages.  In our school, we are constantly striving to improve the attainment of young people, particularly those with Special Educational Needs, those are speak English as an Additional Language and those who do receive or have received Pupil Premium (around 70% of our students).    We believe that languages can have a vital role to play in this and would like to find new and innovative ways to use language learning to develop their children\u2019s skills and improve their attainment.\r\n\r\nWe would like to change the curriculum content of our language classes, improve the status of international events within the school community, further include parents and the local community in our children\u2019s learning, give children the opportunity to communicate with students from another country and continually develop our staff\u2019s ability to teach languages to a high standard. \r\nWe would like to achieve our aims through a one-year project involving two members of our MFL team in training activities in Spain and France. The course we have identified includes intensive language learning, cultural activities, opportunities to discover and evaluate resources, language teaching methodology and pedagogy and teaching ideas, and placement in a Spanish and French school as part of the course.\r\n\r\nWe believe that taking part in these courses will lead to a great increase in our teachers\u2019 confidence to be able to teach more languages to higher levels and also to be able to introduce more up-to-date language and cultural references that will engage pupils and make the learning more relevant to them. They will develop new ways of teaching languages and have the opportunity to share ideas with other teaching professionals on the course and also observe good practice in French and Spanish schools. This will reinvigorate teaching in our school and all ideas will be passed on to the whole of the MFL department.\r\n\r\nThis will result in \r\nbetter language teaching, \r\nlinks developed with Spanish and French schools, \r\nreal communication, better speaking and listening, reading and writing skills, \r\nimproved cultural awareness, \r\nbetter support for EAL/SEN/Pupil Premium children leading to higher attainment, \r\nan increase in children\u2019s aspiration and \r\nbetter uptake of languages for GCSE and beyond, \r\nthe development of new teaching materials and \r\nbetter transition arrangements from Key stage 2. \r\nWe will also have better resources and a more authentic classroom environment, more cultural events and enrichment activities (including possible future pupil exchanges), more involvement of parents and the community and more choice of languages for pupils.", null, "St Peters RC High School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000176_coordinator"], ["4WB", "Cross Curricular Learning to Raise the Profile of Languages!", "St Peters RC High School", 30243.0, "St Peter\u2019s is firmly established as one of Manchester\u2019s most successful high schools. It is a Roman Catholic High School founded on gospel values where pupils are encouraged to live their faith and to lead upright lives.\r\n\r\nThis is a young and exciting school providing excellent pupil care, outstanding examination results and very high quality teaching.\r\n\r\nAs a result of its outstanding performance, St Peter's has been designated as a National Support School and a Leading Edge School giving it the role of helping other schools to improve.\r\n\r\nOur school is in an area of relative deprivation and we want to ensure that all of our pupils have every opportunity to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe demographic of our school and community is rapidly evolving. Whereas previously the community was fairly homogenous, mainly Irish Catholic families, we are now living in a dynamic, multicultural community. \r\n\r\nOur school has a very international atmosphere, which reflects the school\u2019s location in central Manchester \u2013 48% of our students speak English as an Additional Language, and we have over 60 first languages spoken.  Therefore, within our school context, intercultural understanding is crucial.\r\n\r\nWe need to develop a whole school, International ethos which involves languages and other cultures being celebrated, embedded within our school routines and integrated into other subject areas.\r\n\r\nWe need to increase uptake of languages at higher levels. Sometimes our pupils can be disengaged from education and particularly from languages. We need to ensure that they recognise the importance and relevance of language learning and encourage more students to continue studying Modern Foreign Languages for GCSE and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe plan to achieve our aims through a two-year project involving 14 mobilities. Four members of our MFL team will take part in training activities in Spain (2) and France (2). These staff were not involved in the first project. They have seen the impact this training on their colleagues and would greatly benefit from increasing their skills in their second MFL, enabling them to teach both French and Spanish to a higher level, increasing the range of languages available to pupils. \r\n\r\nA further 10 mobilities (5 each to Spain and France) would be for teachers from various departments such as humanities, science, maths, English, technology, LSAs, Cover supervisors and pupil support staff.\r\n\r\nInvolving a range of staff will create a sense of excitement across the whole school and encourage links across departments enabling pupils to see how important and relevant languages in different subject areas and to consider languages as relevant to their own lives and education, encouraging higher uptake.\r\n\r\nWe will establish a whole school, cross curricular approach and greatly increase the status of languages within our school. Many more staff will be involved in promoting language and culture through different subject areas and Spanish and French will become embedded into the life of our school and visible across the school.", null, "St Peters RC High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047405_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M12"}
