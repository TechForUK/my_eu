Nanotechnology is a truly enabling technology, with unlimited potential for innovation. However, the novelty in properties and forms of NMs makes the development of a well-founded and robust legislative framework to ensure safe development of nano-enabled products particularly challenging. At the heart of the challenge lies the difficulty in the reliable and reproducible characterisation of NMs given their extreme diversity and dynamic nature, particularly in complex environments, such as within different biological, environmental and technological compartments. Two key steps can resolve this: 1) the development of a holistic framework for reproducible NM characterisation, spanning from initial needs assessment through method selection to data interpretation and storage; and 2) the embedding of this framework in an operational, linked-up ontological regime to allow identification of causal relationships between NMs properties, be they intrinsic, extrinsic or calculated, and biological, (eco)toxicological and health impacts fully embedded in a mechanistic risk assessment framework.  ACEnano was conceived in response to the NMBP 26 call with the aim to comprehensively address these two steps. More specifically ACEnano will introduce confidence, adaptability and clarity into NM risk assessment by developing a widely implementable and robust tiered approach to NM physico-chemical characterisation that will simplify and facilitate contextual (hazard or exposure) description and its transcription into a reliable NMs grouping framework.  This will be achieved by the creation of a conceptual \u201ctoolbox\u201d that will facilitate decision-making in choice of techniques and SOPs, linked to a characterisation ontology framework for grouping and risk assessment and a supporting data management system.", 351608.0, 9387694.0, 9, 26, "ACEnano", null, null, null, "h2020_206749_923714026"], [1388966400000, 1515196800000, "Pilot Optical Line for Imaging and Sensing", "Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd", "The KET pilot line project POLIS is aimed at maintaining and furthering the innovation capability of CMOS image and optical sensors in Europe.

This development creates opportunities as well as challenges. The growing need for more relevant and competent professional expertise, changes in demographics, and increased globalisation all require new and innovative professional competences and relevant vocational education and training. International cooperation is an integral part of the Hordaland County Council\u2019s (HCC) strategy for regional development. The strategy aims to create a sustainable, attractive and competitive region, and give young people international competence, experience and shared responsibility. As these challenges are not only valid for Hordaland, the HCC see international cooperation as a tool to finding possible solutions to such challenges. The HCC is therefore using participation in different European mobility programmes, such as Erasmus+ VET mobility, as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting the needs for more relevant professional expertise and pedagogical knowledge, international experience, as well as improved foreign language competences and enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\nAs part of the HCC\u2019s strategic plans for internationalisation, international cooperation is to be an integrated part of education and training, as it adds value and quality to the training of professionals. International competences offer VET learners the opportunity to develop their abilities to actively participate in an increasing multicultural society and global world. To achieve these goals, it is an important task of the HCC to mobilise VET schools and training agencies to participate in European mobility programmes. As a regional developer, the HCC also encourage staff in public offices, enterprises and other relevant organisations to improve and strengthen their professional skills within their field of expertise, as well as developing intercultural competence and knowledge. \r\nThe target groups for this mobility project are VET learners, VET staff and other staff in institutions where training is offered. A large portion of the staff mobility projects consists of interdisciplinary groups where at least one of the participants is representing a VET organisation. The participants are key persons and play an important role in the implementation and dissemination of the projects. \r\n\r\nThe HCC is applying for: 204 VET learner mobilities, 129 staff mobilities and 64 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, technology, service, design and agriculture. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as health promoting work in schools, welfare technology, civil entrepreneurship, broader understanding of practices and systems in VET, as well as cooperation between VET and enterprises. \r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to strengthen the region through the acquisition of professional knowledge and expertise, develop new skills and competences, to develop prosperous local communities, improve learning outcomes for VET learners, increase recruitment and the number of VET learners finishing with a trade certificate. In addition to professional competences, it is expected that the project will increase foreign language and intercultural competences, as well as motivate participants to take part in and develop other international projects in the future. This mobility project will have both short and long term effects. It will make it possible to implement and disseminate new and innovative tools and methods to a wide variety of relevant stakeholders. It will also strengthen the quality of education and training, and the region will be able to offer activities and programmes that better respond to the needs of both the individual and the region. This will further increase the status and the attractiveness of VET.\r\nThe HCC writes the mobility application on behalf of its sending organisations, and is the coordinator for the project. The HCC has extensive experience in project cooperation and management through different EU projects (LLP, Interreg) and is well qualified to carry out this mobility project.
