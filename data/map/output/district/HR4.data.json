For example, the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association has abundant evidence about the effectiveness of their members\u2019 technology in reducing loss of life and property in office, residential, retail, storage, public venue buildings and in special sites such as ships, control rooms and hospitals.\nThe proper functioning of fire sprinkler systems can be catastrophically undermined by corrosion. The water in the system pipes is stagnant and, if inhibitors are inactive, then this can give rise to microbiological induced corrosion (MIC), which leads to leaks. This corrosion is localised and is not evident in close visual inspection until the leak starts. Moreover the pipes are often enclosed and difficult to access for close viewing. MIC may occur in both dry and wet sprinkler systems.\nLong range ultrasonic testing (LRUT) has been developed for screening long lengths of pipe (up to 100m from one test location) for corrosion, especially in otherwise inaccessible areas. It has been used to a limited extent on the feeder pipes and risers in sprinkler systems. However, the pipe lengths are too short (typically <5m) and the defects too small in comparison with the ultrasound wavelengths for current LRUT systems. Moreover the numerous features such as pipe elbows and branches, makes interpretation of ultrasound echo-signals difficult.\nSprinkTest aims to inspect automatic fire sprinkler systems by developing a medium range ultrasonic test (MRUT) system, using higher frequency ultrasound (100KHz -500KHz), smaller flexible transducers to gain access to confined spaces, lower power electronics to allow hand-held portability and sophisticated software to process signals and extract information from the numerous guided ultrasonic waves present at the higher frequencies.", 172528.0, 1061068.0, "SPRINKTEST", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110842_950321126"], ["8QU", "A portable device for Early detection and treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury based on advanced qEEG and HD-TES to prevent major Health problems and specially for use in emergencies and telemedicine", "Primasil Silicones Limited", "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is recognized as a major public health concern, especially for teenagers and young adults, since it can lead to significant disruption in education, working ability, and quality-of-life in general. It is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. 1.2 million EU citizens are hospitalized with TBI each year and of which 50.000 die. The total economic burden in Europe for TBI of all known severities is estimated EUR 33 billion annually. Currently, there is no objective method for diagnosing TBI in an early stage or in emergency, which is a premise to prevent serious health impact. Our idea is to develop a portable medical device for objective and reliable emergency diagnosis of TBI and a monitored personalized treatment based on qEEG (quantitative electroencephalography) and HD-TES (High-Definition Transcranial Electric Stimulation). We propose to create innovative technology for the early detection and treatment of one of the most severe cognitive diseases for the use in emergency, telemedicine, hospitals, and rehabilitation centers. We will achieve this by 1) developing a novel vacuum based helmet device that will enable an accurate positioning system of up to 32 electrodes, 2) developing an instrumentation system that will combine qEEG recording and HD\n-TES treatment, 3) developing a data processing system that will control all measurements and data analysis including the algorithm for early detection and treatment of TBI. Our innovation will increase quality-of-life, improve first-aid care, and healthcare in remote and rural areas. Moreover, the society will benefit from sustainable savings in costs for healthcare and for work disability. We, the SMEs, will benefit from increased revenue and sales of the developed technologies and expect 5 year post-project an accumulated revenue of \u20ac 125 million and creating and estimated 833 jobs.", 165636.0, 1173806.0, "EMEREEG", "Electrode helmet diagnoses brain injury", "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide and the technology for rapid diagnosis and treatment necessary to improve prognoses is lacking. A novel point-of-care diagnostic helmet is set to change that.", "In the EU alone, 1.2 million citizens are hospitalised each year, of whom 50\u00a0000 die. This serious public health issue is particularly prevalent among teenagers and young adults whose lives are forever changed. Since the brain affects everything a person does and is, TBI can alter not only functions such as walking and talking but also personality and temperament.\n\nAlthough early detection and treatment are critical to patient outcome, there is currently no objective way to diagnose a TBI at an early stage or on-site at the scene of the accident. Scientists launched the EU-funded project http://www.emereeg.com/ (EMEREEG) to remedy that situation. The technology exploits two non-invasive technologies that assist in diagnosis of TBI in a portable, one-size-fits-all helmet. It targets emergency responders, telemedicine, hospitals and rehabilitation centres. The first nine months have been used to define system requirements and compare conceptual designs.\n\nQuantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and high-definition transcranial electrical stimulation (HD-TES) will enable detection of changes in brain state and dynamics. The device utilises vacuum-placed positioning of electrodes for accuracy. Analysis software will process data quickly and automatically give a diagnosis.\n\nThe system also incorporates a tablet computer for control and local storage and a web-based graphical user interface with wireless data transfer capability. With it, paramedics will have access to specialist support via telemedicine and a neurologist will be able to advise and approve diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCurrently, unconsciousness or required medical sedation at the scene of an accident impairs diagnosis via cognitive exams and sophisticated techniques are expensive and complex, requiring specialised operators. The portable helmet with qEEG and HD-TES will enable rapid neurological examination on site, speeding treatment and enhancing patient outcome.\n\nResults have already led to a publication that was presented at the 2014 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics. With commercialisation, EMEREEG will enhance emergency care and quality of life for individuals with TBI, particularly those in underserved remote and rural areas.

This school is unique in Austria regarding its curricular emphasis on economics and environmental issues, leading up to the A-level exams after 5 years of schooling. A further unique aspect, in addition to the curriculum, are additional qualifications, a tight cooperation with international schools and local economy.In the course of the five years, it is obligatory to do a three-month internship, in which the pupils have to gain practical experience in fields relating to the curriculum: laboratory work, office work, and production work. These internships can be done locally or abroad. In order to give all pupils, even those from financially weaker families, the chance to do their internship abroad, we are trying to get support from the Erasmus+ project. Regarding the partnership with Erasmus+, the HLUW can look back on years of successful co-operation comprising 11 Erasmus+ (formerly Leaonardo) projects with 43 companies in 11 different countries.This year, there are 13 pupils from our third form are looking forward to their internships abroad with the help of Erasmus+. Suitable partner companies have been found in Ireland, Great Britain,  Denmark and the Netherlands. All pupils have already signed learning agreements with the partner companies. Support from Erasmus+  enables us to ensure a good quality of the internships.The project always starts in September with informing the parents and pupils about Erasmus+. After finding suitable partner companies, the framework of conditions is defined. During the internship stay, we constantly try to maintain the quality of the training by adopting parts of the ECVET. After supervision by a contact person, a Personal Transcript and a Europass are compiled.The aim of the project is improvement of the competences required by our curriculum. Due to the wide scope of our curriculum, the focus in the various internships will vary, with this year\u2019s activities focussing on production, sciences and sustainability. By doing the internship abroad, further aspects gain importance: improvement of linguistic competence (this year especially in English), improvement of personal and social competence, increasing knowledge of different approaches and ways of work and quality management. This all intensifies the idea of a common Europe. These diverse aspects are expected to increase the competitiveness and employability of our pupils and thus, indirectly, boost the competitiveness of Europe as a whole.Besides the positive effects on the pupils, the school itself and its partner companies also profit from the cultural and technical exchange, since international internships are supposed to increase the transfer of knowledge and thereby the quality of the training at our school as well as the competences within the partner companies. By means of a thorough documentation of this project and by publishing (project reports, publication in the school yearbook and on the school\u2019s homepage, in local newspapers, project presentations and information on our school\u2019s open days) the results of these projects and the idea behind Erasmus+ will be made more widely known.", "http://www.wyevale-nurseries.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016411_6"], ["9HG", "Host a 3 day intensive workshop to scope an accredited Traveller Culture and Identiy programme.", "The Rural Media Company", 8482.0, "This project aims to scope out the development of an accredited Traveller culture and Identity programme  over a 3 day facilitated workshop with 6 partners,  who are in agreement that this action is necessary.
