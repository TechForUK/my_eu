The exchange will be between 30 Polish young people from Warsaw and 30 young people from the West Midlands in the UK. The exchange will aim to incorporate young people from a variety of social economic backgrounds, some who would otherwise not have the opportunity to experience and engage in another European culture or project. The participants will be between 17-30. During the project both groups of young people will visit places of local interest with historic, cultural and educational benefit. All youngpeople will engage in a social project-social action in the local community working The young people during their preparation sessions will work with leaders to identify and understand needs and choose the social action, this ensures that the young people play an important role in the decision making process. Central to the project will be the working together for the benefit of their local communities and the all the young people will experience identifying local needs and contributing to social action in both countries. For the exchange to Poland the programme aims to develop the participants' personal skills such as communication, understanding and articulation of their own values and culture encourage teamwork and leadership skills, increase confidence and learning about recognising the needs in the local environment. This will then be replicated for the later part of the exchange where young people from Poland will have the opportunity to develop the same skills and engage in a similar experience. The management team will oversee recruitment, health and safety, safeguarding, finance, logistics, travel and preparation of participants, negotiations with young people on the programme of activity. This team as time will evolve and the young people take control of shaping the project will include 4 participants from the UK and from Poland (2 from each country) with relevant experience and will become full members of it. We will prepare them with basic linguistic skills and cultural awareness and there will be training in communication and leadership skills during the preparation sessions. By coming together for a number of meetings, it will provide the participants with the opportunity to prepare together ways of sharing their skills and talents via arts, sports, drama, dance and music in the community where the partner is based. They will prepare a cultural evening to enable exchange participants to better understand the inter-cultural experience. The First objective of our project is to engage the groups of pparticipants in recognising and addressing the needs of the communities they live in and choosing a service project (social action) in their own countries that benefits the local community that they will work with the young people from the visiting country. The host young people will be expected to build a relationship with the service project and already have participated in some of the work and people it serves. Preparation of the young people for both countries is key. Our second objective is to involve young people throughout in the decision making processes including aspects of the project activities such as design of the garden, media project and web design. The third objective of our youth exchange would be to develop relationships between young people and youth workers in both communities. We have included a variety of visits to places of interest, times for fellowship, sharing and fun. Our activities such as sports, team challenges, icebreakers, games, and small groups will also encourage relationships of trust through teamwork and shared interests. The project seeks to develop a wide range of knowledge, skills and attitudes for each participant. The preparation process participants will be expected to identify their own skills and knowledge they hope to acquire by the end of the project. All young people will have the opportunity to develop personal skills such as communication, understanding and articulation of their own values and culture, encourage teamwork and leadership skills, increase confidence and learning about recognizing the needs in the local environment and the culture of the country they visited. Longer-term benefits include the potential increase in young people engaging in civic service and volunteering.", "http://www.kenelmyouthtrust.org.uk/", "Kenelm Youth Trust Limited", "erasmus_2015-3-UK01-KA105-022946_coordinator"], ["4TT", "Odkryj swoje powo\u0142anie", "Kenelm Youth Trust Limited", 21966.0, "The youth exchanges called \"Discover Your Vocation\" is carried out under Action 1 of the \"Erasmus +\" programme. It will be attended by 36 participants aged 16-30 as well as 6 leaders from 3 organizations \u2013 from Poland, Great Britain and Croatia. The participants will be the people who are open-minded, creative and who have their own initiative and some entrepreneurship skills. The project was designed for the young people of the European countries, who are finding it increasingly difficult to choose a career path. We have noticed that in Europe, the education system is not always adapted to the current realities of the labour market and the pace of social change, and that a large proportion of secondary school graduates do not know what career path to take, what translates into poor life choices regarding the field of study. The project was created in response to these needs of young people.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are: to help people discover their own professional skills and to present tools to facilitate decision making process in this aspect of life, and moreover to make them aware of the possibility of continuous search for new ways of professional development and to address concerns related to the decision to choose a career path and their place in society. It is equally important for us to exchange experiences between young people from different countries and to find joint solutions to the problems covered by the project.\r\n\r\nThe work will include workshops where we will discuss issues concerning personal interests and passions, making choices, making decisions related to them and taking responsibility for them. The workshops will be conducted by trainers and project participants prepared for this topic. Participants will also have the opportunity to meet representatives of various professional groups who have achieved a definite and measurable professional success, as well as with people who have chosen to pursue their life's passions, which resulted in a widely understood good for a specific group of people, society or even nation (e. g. works of art, charity work, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe methods that will be used during the workshops are varied. They take into account the creativity of the project participants, and will include work on audio-video materials, dialogue in smaller groups, brainstorming, discussion (panel, non-verbal, debate), field exercises and games (using modern technologies, e. g. geocaching).\r\n\r\nThe expected results of the project are: (1) learning about the process, of professional, personal and life decision-making, its stages and helpful \"tools\"; (2) increasing the level of responsibility of participants for their decisions; (3) developing the creativity of project participants; (4) experience and understanding the principle of human life expressed in the sentence \"it is better to be more than to have more\"; and (5) learning about the similarities and differences in life situation of their European peers.", "http://www.kenelmyouthtrust.org.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PL01-KA105-050227_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ST10"}
