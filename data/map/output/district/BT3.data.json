The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence. The training periods of 3 months and will take place between middle of April and July 2015. The countries that will host future participants will be the UK, Italy and Austria.\r\n\r\nParticipants will receive language training before their departure through the online course which the Erasmus+ Program will make available to them, since the languages of the host countries are integrated into the course. In addition, prior to departure, participants will receive socio-professional and cultural training organized by the Consortium team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results which CUENCA PLUS provided are:\r\n- To consolidate practical training that strengthens the knowledge acquired by young people.\r\n- To promote the improvement of the teaching-learning relationship and academic training.\r\n- Professional specialisation.\r\n- Promoting language proficiency with the aim of achieving bilingualism.\r\n- Promoting the autonomy and responsibility of young people.\r\n- To understand how an EU company operates promoting the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n- To promote intercultural education as a basis for quality European training.\r\n- To improve social skills of young people.\r\n- To promote mutual understanding of academic training in the different EU countries.\r\n- To develop values such as solidarity, tolerance and respect amongst young people.\r\n- To promote recognition of their studies.\r\n- To promote the multiplier effect of mobility experiences.\r\n- To encourage the economic development of the city through better preparation of their young people.\r\n- To encourage the economic development of the city through better preparation of their young people.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact associated with this project: \r\n- Increased competitiveness at local, regional, national, European and / or international levels; \r\n- The flow of the economy, knowledge and ideas; \r\n- Increased collaboration and cooperation between institutions and businesses at international level; \r\n- A social and cultural impact which will create more tolerant citizens.\r\n\r\nThe expected long-term benefits are: \r\n- Improving the quality of candidates for jobs; \r\n- Expanding frontiers in the search for work; \r\n- Generation of new skills; \r\n- New approaches to work.", "http://www.Guardian24.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA102-002297_16"], ["9LF", "SeVET - Sevilla para la Formaci\u00f3n Profesional en Europa", "Bluechip Technologies Ltd", 32335.0, "\"SeVET\" project is promoted by a national consortium comprised of ONECO, which acts as a coordinator based on their experience and expertise in the field of European projects related to education, culture, employment and local development, along with 6 VET organisations based in the province of Seville.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of \"SeVET\" is to complete and complement the offer of the professional training technical certificate taught in schools which are part of the consortium, with work experience taking place in companies in European countries (Italy, Portugal, UK and Ireland) and thereby significantly increasing the levels of employability of participants and promoting their effective entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\nThe main \u201cSeVET\" group consists of 92 young Sevillians in total between 18 and 35 years old, graduates of the Technical Certificate or students in the final year of their training in the Technical Certificate (computed practices abroad as part of the curricular training module in workplaces - Training in the workplace (FCT), and preferably no prior work experience in their professional or academic field. \r\n\r\nProfessional sectors which the project addresses correspond to the training offered by the consortium members:\r\n\r\n- Physical and sports activities. \r\n- Administration and management. \r\n- Business and marketing. \r\n- Information Technology and Communications. \r\n- Personal appearance. \r\n- Health.\r\n\r\nConsortium members, coming from the world of education and training, are fully aware of the needs and problems faced by the Sevillian young population which is completing or has completed Technical Certificate Cycles in the aforementioned sectors, thanks to their interaction in the day to day life of this group.

For this segment of the young population they consider the necessity of training focused on their specified difficulty, which in a year increases their employability and makes possible subsequent rapid entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\nFor the achievement of these objectives, the ALEF will work with 4 intermediary partners (EUROYOUTH (Lisbon, PT), AMADEUS (Vienna, AT), INTERN EUROPE (Belfast, UK), EPPAS (Prague, CZ), which will support the development of the activities of ODISEO 2015 during the stays of the participants abroad.

This network develops their work in the coordinated planning of active policies of employment, training, qualification, intermediation and entry into the workforce of participants in the programs managed by the Agency.

These are the main objectives of JCV - Braga and are at the heart of all the work we carry out and volunteers will be given the opportunity to explore how these can be developed and built upon through the development of new ideas. The volunteers will be entrusted with the autonomy to utilise their skills, experiences and competencies to develop their own projects and ideas and make them a reality within the work of JCV - Braga. This is a key part of the project as we believe that allowing the participants to explore their ideas and develop them into something concrete can only improve JCV - Braga for the better whilst allowing them to develop their skills and competencies as they see fit, rather than constricting them to a predefined structure. Regular mentoring sessions and meetings with the project coordinator and other professionals within JCV - Braga, will allow the participants to help formulate ideas and see them put into action with all the support they require.\r\nThroughout the duration of the project we will use a non-formal education methodologies, allowing the volunteers to learn and develop through their creativity, original ideas and daily participation in the work undertaken at JCV - Braga.

The participating organisations will benefit through the development and strengthening of partnerships and will ensure the strengthening of good practices among all. The children and youths will feel an impact through contact with the volunteers, in a cultural and linguistic perspective and in the acquisition of competences. Finally, every professional, volunteer and beneficiary of activities involving the international volunteers, will expand their knowledge about the Erasmus+ programme, increase their cultural awareness, and conceptualise more creative processes through contact with them. This will also lead to more active participation by young people in their community and Europe.\r\nWhilst there are countless long-term benefits to this project in particular it will allow the young people to become more aware and tolerant towards cultural diversity.
