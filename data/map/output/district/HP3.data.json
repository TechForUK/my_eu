It provides a means of accounting for and expressing usage of natural resources for products, services and technologies, to inform all economic actors including SMEs (Small and Medium size Enterprise) and consumers, on environmentally relevant information. It is a novel, bottom up approach to measure resource efficiency, the results of which are applicable in corporate, industry and society wide contexts. It is an asynchronous, recursive, non-centralised data gathering and dissemination technique for a large scale stakeholder network.\nmyEcoCost aims to support various environmental accounting and assessment practices applicable to various national and international environment policy objectives. It links business added value to a measurement of aggregated resource usage as accepted environmental pressure indicator which goes beyond single issue indicators such as carbon footprint. Using an Internet-based service-oriented architecture (SOA) relevant and timely data is passed from supplier to customer recursively through the whole value chain to produce \u201cecoCosts\u201d for each product or service. The project will demonstrate how it is technically possible to provide timely and accurate resource efficiency statements.\nFor this to happen a series of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) infrastructure components will be arranged: A resource accounting framework to determine \u201cecoCosts\u201d, an ICT delivery mechanism to transfer the measurement from supplier to customer, benchmark figures for companies and consumers linking to macro level policy objectives, and interfaces for industry and consumers to interpret the measurement to assist decision making.\nThe project aims at researching and developing all key ICT and software elements to trial and to demonstrate the resource accounting framework and infrastructure in a proof-of-concept prototype, involving various value chain actors, users, environmental data processors and policy makers.", 258403.0, 3027666.0, "MYECOCOST", "Towards environmentally sustainable consumption", "Consumers and businesses alike stand to gain from environmentally sustainable products. An EU initiative aims to revolutionise product descriptions by listing the amount of natural resources required throughout the complete supply chain of products.", "Being able to assess the natural resources that a product needs and then gather environmental data from its entire life cycle could transform society's business processes, supply chains and consumer behaviour.\n\nThanks to EU funding, the project 'A consumer oriented prototype \u2013 Forming the nucleus of a novel ecological accounting system' (http://www.myecocost.eu/ (MYECOCOST)) is developing an ecological decision-support tool that collects environmentally relevant data along the supply chain of a product, from raw material extraction, manufacturing, assembly and transport to packaging and retailing.\n\nTo design its environmental information system, the project will rely on a global network that connects existing accounting systems. Data will then be transferred from suppliers to customers along financial data throughout the value chains to create an 'ecoCost' for a product at each stage. ecoCost gives a single value or score to consumers and a complete product breakdown to businesses. It is also readable via mobile and electronic devices.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, MYECOCOST application scenarios and system requirements were specified and the software architecture was defined. Based on this, all software components required to operate the system have been developed. The infrastructure that integrates the entire software and enables effective communication among all parties involved in MYECOCOST networks was also developed. Project members are preparing for proof-of-concept and prototyping of the system.\n\nMYECOCOST outcomes should contribute to more sustainable consumption and production patterns.

This is an issue for mainstream and special needs schools across Europe but what can educators do to re-engage their students? This is the question we hope to answer by the end of this project and provide educators with a tootkit and set of methodologies to raise progress in schools across Europe. The key priorities for this project are to support an inclusive educational environment and to research student engagement and student inclusion as key factors in tackling student under-achievement in a number of schools across country, culture and special need. Kliewer and Biklen (2001) found that inclusive groups can have a positive effect on progress levels in both students with special needs and mainstream students. This project has a number of students with special needs, some who are already educated in a mainstream environment, some who are undiagnosed due to poor social backgrounds and some who are educated in a special school setting. This study will research the discrepancy in curriculum progress between a group who are educated in a mixed group of culture and need and a group who are educated in their own school setting and peer group. The project will also focus on the benefits to mainstream students who are educated with special needs peers. \u201cEnhancing student engagement has been identified as the key to addressing problems of low achievement, high levels of student misbehavior, alienation, and high dropout rates.\u201d\u2013Professor Ming-Te Wang,2013. After studying student engagement in many school settings, we felt engaging activities fell under the umbrella of 3 strands; ICT innovation, outdoor learning and physical activity. This study will research the engagement levels and the progression of 2 main groups; one who are educated in their standard peer group or in a mixed group of special needs and mainstream students from different countries and cultures. The project is building on programmes and research such as MOVE, Youth Sport Trust, Forest Schools, Outdoor Learning and 3rd Millennium Learning (Naace) as well as taking into account an ever developing world of culture and technology. By developing and trialling different innovative methods, we will be able to determine how to engage a range of students in a modern world.This study is innovative in it's approach as previous studies have researched engagement or inclusion effects but usually within one main setting or area, meaning that the findings cannot be extended to a different social background, class, culture or need. This project involves a range of social backgrounds, classes, culture and special needs which will provide the study with a breadth of data  unseen so far in research. By using an Engagement chart and scale developed by SSAT, from their study of effective teaching and learning strategies, and adapted by the educators involved in this project, we shall quantitatively measure the engagement of a range of students each term over a 3 year period. This engagement score will be compared against the level of academic progress the students make in each term. By measuring 2 specific groups; an inclusive education group and a group educated in their own school setting with their regular peers,we shall determine whether being educated in a group inclusive of different culture and need enhances or inhibits progress. All findings along with tools and video analysis will be provided on an open website enabling other educators to make use of the findings and tools as well as contribute to the findings in their own right. Together, we shall tackle under-achievement, explore inclusive education further and find what really engages our students to take charge of their own learning in a modern world.",
