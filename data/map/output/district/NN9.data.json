This will allow for more independent living, a reduced need for lifting and manual handling from carers and a reduction in the number of costly disability aids within the home.\n\nThe Homehoist system will function initially as an everyday wheelchair, but will also be capable of lifting the user at certain positions within the home via the integrated hoist system rotate them through 180 degrees to the toilet, the shower, a sofa, or a bed.   This will incorporate a stabilisation system and optional floor clamps will ensure the system is can operate under more demanding load conditions. If others areas of the home need to be accessed the hoist section of Homehoist is able to be detached and used independently, this will also improve transportation of the device by breaking the system down into two lighter more compact units.\n\nAt Hi Tech Automation Limited we want to be sure that our business continues to develop.  We make mechanical and lifting systems and consider ourselves experts in the field.  With the help of AKS Medical, Technik, ARTI Electronics, HERI and IBV, we believe we have identified a novel design solution to the difficulty, comfort and costs associated with lifting a cerebral palsy patient.\n\nThe primary aim of the project is to develop an integrated wheelchair and hoist system capable of independent use by a cerebral palsy patient with upper body strength.

The school is keen to promote European and wider international relationships to broaden its pupils understanding of the world, cultures and people.  The school is also keen to develop its staff by experiencing different teaching and learning methods.  These considerations underpin the school's decision to attend the Swedish Forest Learning  training.\r\n\r\nThe project's objectives of :  creative approaches,  developing and evaluating strategies used within the Swedish system,  develop partnership work with teachers and educators from within Europe, as well as other activities available under the Erasmus+ Programme, reflect on their learning journey,  working  together to develop a plan of action to implement upon their return, share within the group and uploaded to a public website so that teachers within the wider educational community can learn from their experience, evaluate and reflect on practice,cultural understanding, observer the  practice within educational establishments in Sweden and Forest learning skills are aligned with the school's  objectives.\r\n\r\nThe school's participants are two teachers, one experienced and one more recently qualified.  Both have skills  and positions within the school that make them ideal candidates for the Forest Learning training.  Both teachers are fully engaged with the project to be undertaken and have drive and ambition to see the project through to completion.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Learning training will provide a variety of activities which include: visits to establishments that deliver Forest learning, cultural visits, understanding Forest earning strategies and sharing of evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe underlying methodology of the training and school project is to encourage creative approaches to the teaching and learning of Forest learning along with a sound development of evaluation strategies.  These are closely aligned with the objectives of developing partnership work with other teachers and educators from within Europe.\r\n\r\nThe school plans that the impact of the project and training will be felt in several ways.  Firstly the school will benefit from specific Forest Learning training that it will be able to use to implement Forest Learning at the school and thus enhance further its outdoor learning provision and curriculum.  Secondly the school will use the training to establish further ongoing partnerships with teachers and educational entities in Sweden and beyond.

We believe we have positioned ourselves to fully embrace the opportunities that are available in the current and ever changing education landscape.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring that the children in all of our schools and happy, feel safe and are taught well. When they leave us we want them to have enjoyed their primary school experience and be fully prepared and ready to move into secondary phase of education.\r\nThe trust formed in April 2015, is a collaboration of 4 local schools with a focus of working together to improve the learning outcomes for all pupils. Our strapline is 'Stronger together for all our children' and to this aim we share good practice, challenge outcomes and support the trust school improvement plans. We are committed to providing the best possible opportunities to develop children's skills and competencies to be effective European and global citizens. \r\nAll of the schools within the trust are part of the Inspire Teaching Schools group. This means that we work closely with 42 other Primary schools across Northamptonshire. This includes sharing good practice, moderating children's writing and MathsEach of the four schools within the trust are set in an area of some low socio-economic means and low aspirations amongst the general community. Our children come from a range of backgrounds but many have limited experience beyond the very immediate area of the school and little experiences of different cultures. We know that we need to very actively promote other languages and cultures and the recognition that diversity and difference are positive factors. We do this every day through our curriculum and our\r\nactions and words but know that we need to do more to counteract some of the more negative views and stereotypes that pupils encounter outside of school. We believe that the Erasmus+ project can give the school and children this additional stimulus and input. We are fully committed to sharing good practice and collaborating with others to the benefit of all pupils. We strongly believe in the importance of Joint Professional Development and its relevance to improving provision and outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo prepare our children to live and work in a global society, we need to develop our European and then global links.

Staff will be selected based on their role, experience and ability to inspire change and will include, SLT, teaching and non-teaching staff.\r\n\r\nParticipants will receive quality training in all locations. We expect that all locations will enable staff to: think deeply; consider and evaluate their own practice in comparison to that of other individuals and organisations; develop plans and actions to enable others who have not participated to gain the level of understanding needed to move their own practice forward.\r\n\r\nThe methodology will include: visits to centres of excellence and discussion with others and opportunities to question and probe for key learning. As a result, participants will be inspired and excited thereby giving the impetus to impact on others - children and adults. They will also feel more confident about their own knowledge and skills in this area.\r\n\r\nOur children, and those of a wider area, will be more confident and knowledgeable learners who understand their place within a global society and are fully equipped with the skills to make a major contribution to its improvement whether locally, nationally or internationally.", "http://www.iflt.org.uk", "Irthlingborough & Finedon Learning Trust", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047152_coordinator"], ["5TY", "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - with joy of learning", "Huxlow Science College", 227030.0, "Recycling is one of the most common of all environmentally beneficial activities.

The project will have a longer-term multiple effect and sustainable impact both within and outside the participating school (e.g. in other schools or in the community).
