These next generation machines, fixtures and tools will embed extended sensory capabilities and smart materials combined with advanced ICT for self-diagnosis enabling them to become self-aware and supporting self-healing production systems. Distributed diagnostic and predictive repair and renovation models will be embedded into smart devices to early prognosis failure modes and component degradations. Self-aware devices will built on synergetic relationship with their human operators and maintenance personnel through continuous pro-active communication to achieve real self-healing systems. This will drastically improve the resilience and long term sustainability of highly complex manufacturing facilities to foreseen and unforeseen disturbances and deteriorations thereby minimising energy and resource consumption and waste.\n\nThe SelSus vision will be achieved by the development of a new synergetic diagnostic and prognosis environment which is fully aware of the condition and history of all the machine components within a system or factory and is in constant knowledge enriched dialogue with their human personnel. The SelSus project will adopt a systematic approach, supported by a well-defined work plan. The work plan comprises nine carefully defined work packages. In order to guarantee fully committed teams towards comprising goals, the number of individual work packages is kept clearly constrained. The strong industrial pull for the project will be translated into a clear set of industrial requirements aimed at well-defined demonstration scenarios from the automotive and white goods industry.", 227233.0, 5899584.0, "SELSUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.inotecuk.com", null, "fp7_109379_951593960"], ["4LS", "Open dynamic Manufacturing Operating System for Smart Plug-and-Produce Automation Components", "Inotec Ltd", "Higher agility for the European Manufacturing Industry is the main MOTIVATION for the openMOS project. While automated systems are appealing to achieve high productivity and quality requirements, their sensitivity to change is becoming increasingly a bottleneck to substantial reduction of lot sizes and more frequent change-overs. \nThe project VISION is to enable full economic sustainability of the production systems based on intelligent modular plug-and-produce equipment. To achieve this, it is focusing on three main innovation strands: 1) embedding plug-and-produce capabilities into automation devices, robots and machines, 2) enabling vertical and horizontal connectivity between plug-and-produce automation components and higher level control and business functions, and 3) creating a easily extendable and adaptable manufacturing operating system (MOS) that permits the easy introduction of new products, work orders and changes in the equipment and allows easy deployment of optimisation and changeover management strategies. The targeted INNOVATION is a common, openly accessible plug-and-produce system platform which allows all stakeholders in the automation system value chain to come together and jointly develop and exploit solutions. Therefore, the project is proposing to integrate well established plug-and-produce system concepts from many years of research in this field, into industrial-relevant technology platforms which have emerged in recent years. \nAs the vast majority of components/ devices/ machine manufacturers and system integrators are SMEs, plug-and-produce can only be achieved by placing specific SME requirements at the forefront: solutions by, and for, SMEs.\nThe RTD approach will be driven by proposed industrial scenarios and pilot implementations which will be carried out to systematically test and validate the readiness of the targeted exploitable results in three key industrial sectors (white goods, automotive and electronics).", 214083.0, 7301611.0, "openMOS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.inotecuk.com", null, "h2020_198382_951593960"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SS5"}
