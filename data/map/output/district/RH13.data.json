It represents a step change in the volume of fuel cell micro-CHP (micro FC-CHP) deployment in Europe and a meaningful step towards commercialisation of the technology.\nThe programme brings together 9 mature European micro FC-CHP manufacturers into a common analysis framework to deliver trials across all of the available fuel cell CHP technologies. Fuel cell micro-CHP trials will be installed and actively monitored in dwellings across the range of European domestic heating markets, dwelling types and climatic zones, which will lead to an invaluable dataset on domestic energy consumption and micro-CHP applicability across Europe.\nBy learning the practicalities of installing and supporting a fleet of fuel cells with real customers, ene.field partners will take the final step before they can begin commercial roll-out. An increase in volume deployment for the manufacturers involved will stimulate cost reduction of the technology by enabling a move from hand-built products towards serial production and tooling.\nThe ene.field project also brings together over 29 utilities, housing providers and municipalities to bring the products to market and explore different business models for micro-CHP deployment.\nThe data produced by ene.field will be used to provide a fact base for micro FC-CHP, including a definitive environmental lifecycle assessment and cost assessment on a total cost of ownership basis.\nTo inform clear national strategies on micro-CHP within Member States, ene.field will establish the macro-economics and CO2 savings of the technologies in their target markets and make recommendations on the most appropriate policy mechanisms to support the commercialisation of domestic micro-CHP across Europe. Finally ene.field will assess the socio-economic barriers to widespread deployment of micro-CHP and disseminate clear position papers and advice for policy makers to encourage further roll out.\n\nFourth Amendment\nChanges to the DOW in light of the fourth amendment include:\n-\tBeneficiary GDF SUEZ has changed its legal name  to ENGIEDescriptions of financial flows from partner manufacturers are added to the DOW as annexes;\n-\tConsidering the inclusion of new partners, units and budgets are accordingly reallocated:\no\tfor additional units and budget: Viessmann and SOLIDPower\no\tfor reduction of budget and number of units: RBZ, Dantherm, Hexis\n-\tDue to a slow start in trial deployment, the deployment period for units will be extended until September 2016.\nTo protect the confidentiality of some of the information provided by the CHP suppliers in the project, this project description document has two sections.

Europe experiences a step change in the volume of the deployed micro-CHPs by dint of the EU-funded project 'European-wide field trials for residential fuel cell micro-CHP' (http://enefield.eu/ (ENE.FIELD)).\n\nResearchers, together with nine micro fuel cell CHP manufacturers across Europe, are working on a common analysis framework to deliver trials of all the available cogeneration technologies. These generators are being installed and monitored at different types of dwellings and places with different climates. ENE.FIELD should thus obtain a valuable data set on domestic energy consumption and micro-CHP applicability across Europe.\n\nENE.FIELD is enhancing practical learning and demonstrating the micro fuel cell CHP market potential, and cost and environmental benefits, while developing market-orientated product specifications and harmonised standards.\n\nThe project consortium has already laid the groundwork for a well-structured, robust roll-out of the ENE.FIELD large-scale demonstration of micro fuel cell CHPs. Field trials have been conducted in Germany and the United Kingdom, and a tracking system is now ready for use. Partners have also prepared a monitoring scheme and developed suitable materials for analysing field trial data.\n\nBy learning the practicalities of installing and supporting a fleet of fuel cells with real customers, ENE.FIELD partners are paving the way towards their commercial roll-out.

However this process produces a black liquor with no viable economic disposal solution for small-scale production. The process cannot achieve reasonable running costs (heat, pressure, chemical renewal), requires dry straw, uses expensive recovery techniques and requires skilled workers to operate the digester.\nECOPULPING is an alternative processing method enabled by corresponding novel equipment design. This process in turn enables much easier and more efficient processing and 100% valorisation of the process output. Our novel ECOPULPING process does not require any pressure and very low heating meaning low running costs and which simplifies the recovery treatments and requires less costly materials. This leads allows access to valuable co-products which will be worth up to or more than twice the value of output when compared to current pulping mills and produces no liquid waste or odour. The plant is designed to operate as a closed-loop system meaning that there is little chemical top up needed. It can use straw with high moisture content and therefore there are no storage costs.\nWe have already built a pilot plant capable of producing 400 kg per day of unbleached and un-cleaned pulp, and soon a cleaner pulp in the UK. The plant is successfully being used to process pre-production samples for prospective partners using paper mills to finish the paper products.\nThe overall first objective for the ECOPULPING project is to build a 50 tonne bleached straw pulp a day demonstrator. We will first conduct a feasibility study including the validation of customer demand, securing a demonstration site, validation of co-product uses and technical gap analysis.", 40092.0, 57274.0, "ECOPULPING", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_204300_921122962"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9JH", "Improving European language and bringing  a purpose to language learning", "Southwater Junior Academy", 3463.0, "The background of the project is to improve European language within the school and bring a purpose to language learning.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are to actively encourage staff and pupils to learn new skills authentically, improving and discovering new vocabulary and expressions.
