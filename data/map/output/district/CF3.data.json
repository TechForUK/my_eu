The quality of stored produce decreases rapidly due to pest infestation with cost implications for producers and dealers who cannot increase the time-to-market of their products. Pesticides in the form of fumigants are widely used during post-harvesting and are particularly suitable for killing pests, as on-field fumigation usually cannot guarantee absolute disinfestation. Pests can develop resistance to pesticides and often survive in the form of eggs or larvae. Furthermore, rain can easily attenuate the effects of fumigants. Despite the fact that fumigants help to control infestations, maintain the appealing appearance of produce longer and maximize storage time, increasing regulations on pesticide use and consumer selectivity of the foods they eat are creating a competitive threat to SME profit margins.

Specific Objectives are student centered:1 Learners at the centre 2 The social nature of learning3 Emotions as integral to learning4 Recognizing individual differences5 Stretching of all students6 Assessment for learning7 Building horizontal connectednessThrough identifying these processes for developing a school environment that supports CoL we will then work on the areas that contribute to the CoL tool/matrix (O1/O2)through the following activities:O3-O4 \u2013 study the impact of project on students\u2019 wellbeing through a 3 year annual survey and reports identifying strengths and areas for development05-06- strengthen the professionalism of teaching profession with action research challenges built into short study visits and case studies produced after these visits.07 a self-evaluation tool kit for teachers to reflect on and improve/adapt their practice08- More innovative teaching and assessment resources to reflect needs of 21st century learning \u2013 with digital learning  and competence core requirement.09 \u2013 website to host interactive CoL tool O1 and resources and tools developedO10 \u2013 instructional blogs/videos produced by practitioners to support innovative teaching &  learningWe will use a Professional Learning Community methodology with partners; it is a participatory approach based on identifying the problems, seeking solutions from research, testing solutions in context and evaluating impact.   CoL project will focus on the teaching profession at classroom and leadership level and their inter-relationship with their community (pupils and parents) LAs, universities and policy makers in creating the \u2018CoL'.Our participants are:7 Schools 300+ Senior leaders and teaching staff in the schoolsOver 3000+ potential Students in 7 schools1 LA  Education Directorate University Wales Trinity St David \u2013 education faculty 2 lead staffUniversity Latvia Faculty of Education \u2013 4 lead staffJagiellonian University Poland -Education Dept.- 2 lead staff 12 multiplier events will target 300+ additional participantsThe results/impact of the project :Identified conditions for 21st century skills and culture of learningIMPROVED PROCESSES and SYSTEM CHANGE  increasing participation of students in effective learningImproved quality of lessons and subsequent learningIncreased professionalism of teaching profession \u2013 including synergy with New deal for teachers WalesNew resources tailored to 21st century skills, specifically supporting Successful Futures, Wales; Improving literacy skills in Iceland, promoting STEM subjects for Latvia/Wales and involving students in their learning for PolandImproved outcomes for students \u2013 supporting ET2020 targets", "http://www.greenwayprimary.com/", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024318_9"], ["0JZ", "Not in Education, Employment, or Training - a challenge for Europe", "Meadowlane Primary School", 380613.0, "The Strategic Framework for Education and Training (ET 2020) for Europe has at its core the important target of reducing the number of young people leaving school early that become Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).  According the EU statistics about young people and NEETs the countries involved in this project are all facing similar problems related to the youth\u2019s disengagement from education, labour market and, in worst cases, from society. In 2011, 14 million young people 18-29 years in Europe were NEET - this problem is still an issue.\r\nIn all four countries the situation of young people being excluded from education many through social disadvantage is an on-going problem. A radical new approach is required to create longer-term solutions.\r\nThe project is based on a combined approach of early intervention, parental education coupled with active participation by young people falling into the risk category of becoming NEET to tackle this issue head-on developing a unique, innovative and inspiring project. \r\nThis 3-year project aims to look at the causes, influences and barriers to education that result in so many young people becoming NEET. The many strands to this project aim strategically to explore what viable alternatives there are nationally and internationally to traditional learning models that contribute to the challenge faced by many young people in both the primary and secondary sector but also to the parenting behind these young people.\r\nThe project will focus on engagement with schools, pupils, their families and local organisations working at grass roots to support pupils and their families to explore how collaboratively we can support pupils to remain in school/educational setting.  We will also work with local businesses to scope how we can support young people in the world of work through better work experience models. \r\n\r\nTo support these aims, objectives, and training activities we will develop seven Intellectual Outputs:\r\n\u2022 Baseline assessment\r\n\u2022 Early Identification Tool\r\n\u2022 Phase 1 of the World of Work Toolkit \r\n\u2022 Phase 2 of the World of Work Toolkit\r\n\u2022 Good Practice guidelines\r\n\u2022 Research & Analysis report\r\n\u2022 Good practice guidance\r\n\r\nThere will be one multiplier event in Cardiff to promote the aims of the project and widen participation in the using resources and methodology developed. Pupils and staff from Wales and from partner regions will deliver workshops.  Delegates will learn of the good practice and will be encouraged to become involved in this project through in order to widen the participation across Europe.\r\nThere will be FOUR short exchange programmes for pupils \u2013 with opportunities for them to share experiences, develop pupil voice and develop as global citizens through inter-cultural dialogue.\r\nThere will be THREE short-term joint staff training events for staff to share experience and develop approaches to working with pupils at risk of becoming NEETS. There will also be opportunities to work shadow while on the short-term study visits.\r\nThe participants in this project include:\r\n9 Schools\r\n4 Local Authorities/Regional Authorities\r\n1 social enterprise/non formal education \u2013 Non Governmental Organisation\r\nWe will also involve local organisations who work at grass roots level with young people who are potential NEETS and local businesses, but not listed as partner organisations.\r\nAs a direct result of this project, we expect to see increased engagement by pupils and their parents in education.  The result from which will be raising in standards and a reduction in the number of pupils becoming NEET.", "http://www.meadowlaneprm.cardiff.sch.uk", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036582_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF3"}
