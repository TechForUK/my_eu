The project will offer vocational students in these subjects inspiring and educational 4-week work placements with our experienced European host partners. The project also offers VET tutors the opportunity to undertake 7-day staff training visits to European host partners, to learn from their training methods, share experience and form lasting mutually benefical partneships. The project will fund 4-week placements for 47 environmental students and 55 craft students. PETS will also fund 7-day staff training placements for 18 teachers from environmental courses and 26 craft tutors (all from VET courses level 1-3).\r\n\r\nThis application benefits from over 10 years of Grampus promoting environmental and traditional skills and craft placements through the Leonardo da Vinci programme. This application and consortium combines the experience of delivering two certified IVT projects \u2018Training in Contemporary Applications of Traditional European Crafts\u2019 (TICATEC) and \u2018Developing Environmental Skills In Rural Europe\u2019 (DESIRE) within the Lifelong Learning Programme. (mobility certificate UK/09/LLP-LdV/MC/Z007) \r\n\r\nHost countries represented in the consortium are Czech Republic, Slovakia, Cyprus, Germany, Romania, Iceland, Slovenia ,Bulgaria Ireland and Turkey.\r\n\r\nParticipant students and recent graduates will develop a higher degree of self confidence, put theory into practice, gain new skills, improve existing skills and competences, inspire a renewed interest in their chosen subject, gain new language skills and complete a CV enhancing placement which will improve employment prospects and/or enable an informed progression to higher level study.\r\n\r\nParticipating staff will benefit from placing their own training in a wider European context. Travelling tutors will not only explore new skills, methods, approaches and techniques but will also share their own experiences with host organisations. This experience will give staff access to new ideas and approaches to training which will have a positive impact on their own training delivery. This will ultimately benefit vocational students of the tutor and enable the tutor to pass on new skills and information with a broader European scope.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to: 1 Provide a period of \u2018real work\u2019 experience for beneficiaries studying environmental and craft courses in the UK at VET level. 2. To ensure that this period of European experience is of relevance to the participant\u2019s course of study and can be accredited as such. 3. To increase the appreciation in beneficiaries of the benefits of European cooperation and the fact that we are facing similar challenges across Europe. 4. To provide beneficiaries with sufficient time and support to increase competencies in key environmental and craft skills being used on the placement. These include:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Skills: planting, coppicing, footpath design and construction, countryside furniture construction (bridges, steps benches etc), biodiversity assessments and species identification, basic surveying, habitat management, organic sustainable food production.\r\n\r\nCraft Skills: weaving, embroidery, silversmithing, blacksmithing, ceramics, wood carving, green wood construction, traditional building techniques (natural materials), \r\n\r\n 5. To develop a sustainable European VET partnership (hosts, UK colleges and Grampus) which can share experience and develop future cooperation projects. 6. To increase the employment prospects of participating students through gaining real-work experience and laying the foundation for language skills 7. To enhance UK VET training provision in environmental and traditional skills by providing 7-day staff placements for tutors with relevant European hosts.\r\n\r\nThe project management methodology for the PETS consortium is consistent with the 2001 Recommendation on mobility for students, persons undergoing training, volunteers, teachers and trainers and the ten principles set out in in the European Quality Charter for Mobility.\r\n\r\nStudents are accredited as part of their UK course of study for the mobilities. All participant mobilities are recognised through the Europass certificate as well as the Europass CV and language passport. Host partners provide a minimum of four language lessons with professional tuition. All staff mobilities are recognised within an agreed CPD plan with their own organisations. Host partners also provide certification and a record of achievement in their own format as additional evidence of achievement.\r\n\r\nDetailed learning agreements are drawn up prior to placement through discussion between participants, hosts and UK colleges. These provide a realistic benchmark against which the success of the project and placements will be evaluated.", "http://www.cornwall.ac.uk", "Grampus Heritage and Training Limited", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000265_23"], ["4DJ", "Laboratorn\u00ed a ml\u00e9k\u00e1rensk\u00e1 praxe student\u016f, absolvent\u016f a pracovn\u00edk\u016f VO\u0160P a SP\u0160M Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e ve Spojen\u00e9m kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed", "Cornwall College Further Education Corporation", 35974.0, "Our project \"Laboratory and dairy practical training of VO\u0160P and SP\u0160M Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e students, graduates and staff in the United Kingdom\" has emerged from our previous excellent experiences with Leonardo da Vinci programme (individual placements in the Netherlands) and on the grounds of our need to offer a good quality practical training abroad not only to our students, but to our graduates and staff as well. Since the target groups have changed we started to look for new partners in the UK. During her professional training in the UK the project manager managed to obtain contacts to our partners and since 2012 we have been discussing the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to enhance vocational and language competences of the participants and, introduce them to common laboratory and technology practice in British schools and professional companies. We intend to practise professional terminology of our students and to verify and enhance their key vocational skills (laboratory and technology). Further on, we plan to compare various dairy producers and milk processing facilities in the UK and the Czech Republic, raise self-confidence and language fluency of the participants, their interest in the branch and establish need for lifelong learning. Finally, we feel the urge to motivate young people, attract new students and regain lost credit of the school.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 20 participants divided into 3 groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The 1st target group consists of all 12 3rd grade students of Food analysis in secondary school. There is a lack of strong individuals who would participate in an individual foreign practical training. However, they uttered need and interest to carry out vocational training abroad as a group for a short period of time. Thus, we have planned a14-day training with 2 accompanying teachers at schools focused on the same branch. The 1st week (29/06-06/07/2014) has been arranged with Reaseheath College (lab training, excursions and a trade show in Birmingham).For the 2nd week (07/07-13/07/2014) we plan to verify lab and technology skills in Duchy College. With regard to the profile of the group and the fact that there is a hearing-impaired student with learning difficulties and 2 students who will turn 18 within July, we assume that presence of 2 accompanying persons is necessary (enlisted within activity 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The 2nd target group is made of 5 experienced adult participants with excellent moral and personal background. They are students and graduates of both secondary and higher vocational schools, who have been indicating true interest, have mastered English and experienced a stay abroad. We have planned a 3-week individual training in food labs, which will verify and develop their key vocational and language competences. We assume they will be more self-confident, start to think of their job prospects on labour market, confirm their need for lifelong learning and understanding general matters in context. The training will be provided by our partner agency Europa Training UK Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The 3rd target group is formed by a lab assistant, our 2011 higher school graduate, who has got relevant language knowledge and vocational skills, excellent moral and job profile. She has been showing deep interest in the branch and admits need for further education and training. We have planned a 3-week job-shadowing activity with Europa Training UK Ltd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology of the project realization includes a preparatory phase (organizational matters, vocational, cultural and language seminars) followed by the training courses themselves and finally there is a dissemination phase, which will result in series of articles published in local and professional media, information posted on school website, an interview for a school magazine Fresh Milk, CD with photos and presentations, discussion with students. To conclude the project we will carry out evaluation via individual questionnaires and interviews with the director and project manager. In the end we will evaluate the project with our foreign partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnticipated impact regards participants (enhanced vocational and language skills, personal development, need for lifelong learning), the target groups (enhanced cohesion and team work), all participating organizations (development of mutual cooperation within Erasmus+ programme, enhanced key competences of project teams and higher credit of the institutions).  \r\n\r\nWe expect that throughout the project we will raise quality and a number of student, graduate and staff mobilities in VET, support foreign language studies, raise both quality and volume of mutual cooperation among educational institutions, companies and social partners. We aim to offer equal education to all students and contribute to transparency and recognizing skills and qualifications in Europe.", "http://www.cornwall.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-CZ01-KA102-000924_2"], ["4DJ", "Smooth Transition to Employability and Professional Skills from School & VET", "Cornwall College Further Education Corporation", 166249.0, "CONTEXT BACKGROUND: STEPS (Smooth Transition to Professional Skills and Employability from School & VET project emerges from the confluence of the need to promote employability and professional skills of young people, a fact that both the European figures prove it, but also the daily work of COCIN in this area, and on the other, needs identified by San Juan Bautista school and VET teachers and students regarding Employability Guidance from School and VET (see part D of this form and further detailed in attached PDF) A Networking event organised by COCIN on February 25, 2014 within WELCOME & CO transfer of innovation project (2OI2-L-ES1-LEO05-49461), where educational institutions were main target group/attendees allowed first contact with that shown needs.
