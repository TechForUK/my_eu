The project provides the following components of international professional management competency:\r\n+ expand / deepen the knowledge of foreign languages\r\n+ apply professional knowledge in a foreign company and learn new working-methods\r\n+ acquire intercultural competence\r\nAs a vocational school we train for various professions of business, technical, socio-educational fields and the field of care. Our school also has \u201cProduktionsklassen\u201d. These students also should get - as disadvantaged - the opportunity to participate in a learning mobility. For the trainees who gain the additional qualification \"European businessman/-woman\" the participation is obliging. \r\nFor the first time we would also provide this opportunity for apprentices who have completed their vocational training and have not yet participated in a mobility. \r\nIn total for the BBS Osterholz-Scharmbeck (also for 5 other vocational schools in the region) applies for 271 mobilities for 2 years, including 8 to the disadvantaged students. 12 teachers will accompany them and the  groups with minors.\r\nAs a model school for a mobility centre for the school district L\u00fcneburg, a project of the Ministry of Education in Lower Saxony, we support vocational schools which have carried out up to now only a few or no mobilities. They are part of our project and will send students of the socio-paedagogical area, electronics engineers, hairdressers, retail dealers, wooden technology, all together 95 delegations.\r\nIn order to promote the internationalization of initial vocational training, it is important to improve the skills of trainers and teachers. So we offer the possibility for learning stays and working stays. In addition to individual mobilities that deal with methods and concepts to improve vocational education and training systems, we will send a group of teachers. As a mobility center, we want to send teachers to the NL  to deal with the objectives, procedures and methods of vocational training and to prepare concrete mobilities for their students. Through the individual mobilities we want to strengthen the strategy of internationalization of the respective vocational school and improve the language skills. Their absence in school is a reason for the restraint of teachers to implement mobility projects. 28 people will participate in these activities. A further aim is to create a mobility orientated curriculum for participation of Lower Saxony vocational schools.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2 \u2013 6- week stays most trainees will complete a vocationally orientated language training and do an internship, some will make the internship at the foreign branch of their training companies and together with an English college we plan to perform a school-based program for two groups.\r\nIn addition to the job-related activities, the participants will cover the following topics in the placement companies:\r\n+ Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other the resources.\r\n+ Create professional biographies of employees\r\nWe expect the participants to gain an increase in technical and methodological skills, and also in interpersonal skills and a strengthening of intercultural competence. Further we expect as a result that they\r\n+ improve their language skills and in terms of job-related use.\r\n+ can compare the procedures in the foreign company with the processes within their company.\r\n+ are more motivated for their profession and the type of school they attend. This might prevent early school-leaving.\r\n+ know what a company can do to reduce greenhouse emissions and work resource-efficiently.\r\n+ e.g. care \u2013 apprentices improve their understanding of care and demonstrate a respectful and social behaviour.\r\n+ e.g. in the area of social-pedagogic they get to know concepts of the partner institutions and work accordingly.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation, we have developed a coordinated project management of 9 work-packages.

The practical rele-vance of the apprenticeship is ensured during the vocational training by firmly inte-grated work experience placements in companies in Bremen and also by the opera-tion of international training firms. Our objective is the institutionalisation of work ex-perience programmes in the target languages of English, French and Spanish (roughly 120 students have chosen either French or Spanish as a second language!). We have always been faced by the problem of dissimilar school structures and inter-ests when searching for partner schools to cooperate with. A Leonardo da Vinci pro-ject for the preparation of work experience provided the opportunity for colleagues at our school to develop devices for the preparation, controlling and evaluation of work experience in a transnational project. Work experience placements have been organ-ised and carried out over the last years in a similar structure but with other responsi-bilities. Most of our students would not be able to participate in a work experience placement abroad were it not for the financial support provided by the Erasmus + Programme. Our students are taught language skills in a first and second foreign language in an internationally active training firm and in commercial correspondence in preparation for demanding administrative activities. All students have French or Spanish as a second foreign language (they will have received tuition in one of these languages for at least six or eight school years by the time they sit their final exam). English will have been learnt for eight to ten years. All students have the possibility of acquiring external foreign language certificates. Roughly 40% to 60% of students make use of this opportunity depending on their age group. The focus of our partner schools in France, England and Spain as well as their contacts to regional compa-nies match our interests. The work experience placements serve the acquisition of international expertise, of social and intercultural competence and, especially in the case of our trainees, the furthering of language skills.

The positive experience already gained young people at the beginning of their working life will change the setting to a common Europe.\r\nThe trainees will build on their language and human competencies and acquire new professional action competence.

The project focuses on offering a three-weeks internship in the European Union. The students involved in the project are doing a vocational training or a similar career in school. For next two years we are planning to send six students every year to different countries like Great Britain, where we work with a really reliable partner.

In this overall context we organize work experience placements abroad. Thus they are one of the building blocks of our profile as a Europe School. Furthermore, work placements abroad are part of the curriculum provided by the Hessian Ministry of Education. They also  meet the requirements of the job profiles of the learners involved in this project: Foreign language assistants and bespoke tailors work in internationally operating companies, social care assistants and students also need intercultural competencies as they will be working with an increasing number of clients with a migrant background. Finally, the shop assistants work in Alsfeld, a European Model Town, with lots of tourists from all over the world.\r\nIn-service teacher training has a European dimension too and is, therefore, another building block of our profile. In the past activities took place in Finland, France and Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of this project is based in the development of personal competencies of the learners. Flexibility, initiative, resilience, cultural open-mindedness and  a tolerance for ambiguity are being promoted. Also, promoting the foreign language competencies, especially listening and speaking skills, is essential. Foreign language assistants need skills in reading and writing as well. With regard to the vocational competencies, the placement  functions as a link, i.e. a connecting activity between the first and the second course year. The learners apply what they have learned in school and thereby expand their skills and competencies through practical work in the placement companies. The political dimension of the project can be found in its close connection to the European labour market. It is an opportunity to experience European mobility.\r\nThe overall objective in teacher training is staff development following to-date standards. The teacher in question is to enhance her competence profile, i.e. her didactic skills and teaching methods and to improve her job opportunities within the Max-Eyth-Schule\r\n\r\nAll in all 72 students are involved in this project. The average age is between 18-20 years. Most participants have left secondary school with a GCSE-school leaving certificate.\r\nAll students complete their placements in companies, however, in Great Britain, Sweden and Finland we cooperate with local vocational colleges. It is their task to provide placement companies and host families, to organize induction courses (UK only) and, eventually, to act as contact persons for our students.\r\n\r\nA team of teachers who bear responsibility for the respective target groups supervise the project. The project management follows a proven and documented routine. Essential stepping stones are as follows: information, application and election of participants, foreign language, intercultural and organizational preparation, monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of results. The results are then used by second-year students for their own preparation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the overall aims of the project, its outcome and effect are expected in the promotion of intercultural capacity, self-confidence and resilience of the participants. Regarding the vocational competencies the full-time students will have applied their acquired theoretical knowledge in a practical environment. They learn to immerse quickly into a foreign business and social context and they will be able to make use of this experience in their professional career. Finally, with regard to  foreign language learning we note that most students develop better listening skills. They are also able to improve their fluency.\r\n\r\nThe certificate the students receive at the end of their placements (Europass Mobility, reference letter) is the immediate benefit the students gain from the project.

Secondly, students attending a full-time course that leads to graduation are applicable and finally, the teachers, training supervisors and the representatives of our European partners.\r\n\r\nThe students are eager to gain new experiences in professional business situations in order to improve their intercultural decision-making, responsibility and language competence and thus qualify for the European labor market. The \u201cEuropass Mobility\u201d is issued as a standardized certificate to give the trainees the possibility to document learning periods in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe entire number of requested mobilities is ??? for trainees and ??? for staff members from the vocational schools and other institutions in the sector. The total number of mobilities is going to be split among the two cooperating schools. The students are going to be offered spots for internships in the partner countries Finland, Ireland, Estonia, Spain, Romania, the Netherlands and the UK. The mobilities for staff members are going to be used in order to meeting European partners and getting agreements on the necessary steps involved in facilitating a mobility.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay in a foreign country, students with less language proficiency are recommended to take part in a 1 or 2-weeklong language course before starting their internship. In such cases, a language school would be the receiving organization. Particularly for part time students, trained  within the dual system, this option is less important. That is why they normally start their internship right away and in these cases, the company facilitating the learning period, is the receiving institution.\r\n\r\nThe implementation and realization of traineeships in foreign countries demands careful consideration by the members of the EU-team when picking the participating students. During the preparation process, contractual and other necessities are being taken care of thoroughly. Furthermore, an intercultural training session ensures the proper understanding of cultural habits and particularities on the side of the students. During the stay in a foreign country, the students are representing their schools, companies and homeland. They are supposed to show an appropriate attitude in everyday life making cultural experiences. In private and business conversations with individuals they are to be open-minded, respectful and understanding.\r\n\r\nThe BBS I Lueneburg and the BBS Winsen (Luhe) are contributing to the internationalization of vocational training together with their local and regional partners. Both institutions are advocating the principle of international understanding and rapprochement between various European cultures. An important factor of that is to educate subjects about cultural characteristics and distinctions of citizens from European nations as well as their respective habits. The objective is to tackle our students\u2019 prejudices during their internships, make them more tolerant towards new cultural experiences and help them develop an attitude of inquisitiveness and acceptance.\r\n\r\nIt is also the goal to foster the development of intercultural, language and socio-cultural competences that are relevant within the sphere of the corporate world. During that process the different learning abilities and skills of the learners are to be taken into account.
