PYROCHAR will provide small municipalities and their waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) with an economically and environmentally sound solution for the treatment and disposal of their sewage sludge.\n\nThe implementation of European Directives for waste water treatment, while improving general quality and management of wastewater in the Union, has led to a situation in which, today, 10 million tonnes of sewage sludge are produced annually across the 26 member states.\n\nMore than 60% of the WWTPs in Europe service small municipalities. For these plants, the established sludge treatment and disposal options, developed specifically for large treatment plants, are too complex and expensive to provide on-site practical solutions.\n\nBecause of this, small WWTPs face a number of challenges presented by sewage sludge:\n\u2022  They must comply with EU directives for wastewater treatment and sludge management.\n\u2022  The costs of sludge treatment, storage and transport to composting/incineration facilities, farming or to larger WWTPs for further treatment are high.\n\u2022  New technological solutions and those in development are focused on medium to large scale WWTPs. The adaptation of these to small scale plants requires investment and investigation that are simply not prioritised.\n\u2022  There is a high level of public mistrust of sewage sludge and its reuse, which widespread fears about adverse effects on the environment and human health.\n\nThe PYROCHAR technology will thermochemically treat sewage sludge, converting it to biochar (biomass-derived charcoal) and synthesis gas (syngas) in a system with low operation and maintenance costs and compliant with EU regulations.

The project will consist of co-curated exhibitions, accompanied by a rich public mediation programme, artist residencies, a common web platform, and an international conference. The aim of the project is twofold: on the one hand to deal with past phenomena related to migrations, and on the other, to link these phenomena to current migrations. In order to do so successfully, it is necessary to collaborate on a transnational level.The questions that the project departs from are: What are the common experiences that might link these seemingly different migrants? And how did mass arrivals of people from various parts of the world change not only the way we perceive Europe but also the way Europe is perceived from the outside? With a focused attention to the forms of progressive imagination we would like to offer some answers to those questions. The questions are especially relevant in our contemporary situation when new migrants, asylum seekers and refugees are arriving from all parts of the world due to social, political and economic reasons as well as climate changes. Europe has always been faced with the challenge of including migrants in society. These processes are usually long and complex.
