Nano-scratching clearly operates at a different length scale to macro- and micro-scratch tests, but can be a straightforward extension of the capability of nanoindentation equipment. This is an area where European industry is very strong, three European SMEs have a dominant role in production of such instruments.\nIn scratching a sharp, stiff tool is moved on the surface of the sample while a normal force is applied on the tool tip. At different threshold values of the force the tip penetrates into the sample by various mechanisms. These threshold forces, or more precisely the stresses that are generated at these thresholds, are characteristic parameters for the failure of the substrate-coating system in question.\nTest procedures and software for nano-scratching are in their infancy compared to those for nanoindentation.
