We have identified a great need to develop opportunities for students to develop their global compentences. With this project AARHUS TECH will be able to offer the same opportunities to students in school based practical training as students having a contract with a company. The project will develop the quality of the school based practical training and give the students at AARHUS TECH equal opportunities in preparing for a globalized labor market. \r\nFurthermore, this project will raise the bar for quality of the mobilities of students by including competence development at both teachers and management level. Furthermore the ambition is to integrate ECVET as a standard for all mobilities through long-term partnerships which allows teacher-to-teacher cooperation on selecting and developing the relevant learning outcomes for each education at both basic and advanced level.\r\nThe project is a step in making the vocational educations more internationalized as well as supporting the school based practise as a real and valid alternative to the traditional apprenticeship contracts. \r\nIn the coming year AARHUS TECH is also going to strenghen and improve the international strategy and therefore the school wish to sent a management group to Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Finland to learn from their experience. Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 has succesfully gone through a similar proces over the past 10 years and is today considered among the best vocational schools in terms of internationalisation.\r\nWith this application we focus on three mobility activities:\r\n1) Students in school based practical training to go on a minimum 3 week mobility in a company in Finland, UK or Italy. \r\nStudents in school based practise suffer from the genreal understanding that their practical training is less relevant and educating as if they were in a compamny. This might have been right 5-10 years ago. Today the reality is different and the general quality is high. One aspect can be improved - and that is to strenghen their possibilities to go abroad. This requires more than for other students because the ministerial demands on documenting and supervising their learning is much higher for school based practise than for in-company students.

A new reform of the vocational system, a huge restructuring of the organization and a cut back of 10% of staff. This could easily have had a negative influence on the international opportunities for our students. This is not the case. Since 2014 we have channelled all focus from partly placement in companies and partly modules at partner colleges to focusing on developing quality modules together with partner colleges in Europe. This has led to the situation we have today, where we can present a number of well described, ECVET accredited and fully validated modules for our students. The modules are being implemented in our yearly schedule, which means students can plan ahead and select modules according to their interested and the interest of their employer. 111 students and 22 teachers are to benefit from this mobility project, which follows the development plan of the international strategy of AARHUS TECH. The majority of our students going abroad will replace part of a main course with an international module. Mobilities in this project will support students from ICT, painters, Industrial technicians, blacksmith, electricians and chef to attend international and fully accredited modules in Netherlands, Finland, Spain and France. Many of the modules are offered through a college Network www.EM-EU.EU which is developed through a KA2 Strategic partnership (participating partners: JAO and SAVO, Finland; Horizon College, Netherlands; XABEC, Spain). In the EMEU network, we focus on implementation of ECVET and quality assurance of modules. Cooperation with Lycee Professionel Monge is following the same concept and guidelines although Lycee Monge is not yet a part of the EMEU network. Previously the main international activities for students were integrated in a prolonged the basic course. With the new reform, we had to rethink this. This spring we are running the first test of an optional course \u2018Go Global\u2019, which includes an ECVET accredited mobility experience at Solihull College in UK. The optional course are for basic Year students who has the needed levels of Math, English, Physics and Danish and thereby have the possibility to choose extra curricula courses. Go Global is being tested with ICT and Auto Mechanic students and is expected to be an optional course at all educations from spring 2017. Because it is a big group travelling together (20-25 students) and there will be students below 18 years, we believe it is crucial both for group and to support our partners to send an accompanying teacher. A total of 22 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. 2 teachers, one from industrial technicians and one blacksmith, will each teach one week at XABEC, Spain. Equally, one teacher from XABEC will teach at AARHUS TECH. 9 teachers will go for job shadowing at Horizon College, JAO, Lycee Monge and Solihull College. The job shadowing will include the development and description of new ECVET accredited modules to be introduced for each other\u2019s students. Part of the restructuring of AARHUS TECH includes a new quality assurance department. A project group in this department will visit Solihull College to get inspiration and input for the development of new teaching concepts and quality assurance. Furthermore, 2 management representatives and 2 from the communication department of AARHUS TECH will also make a training abroad to get new input for communication strategies both for AARHUS TECH as a whole and specifically to increase and improve the dissemination activities of the ERASMUS+ projects.Our Charter application got a very positive feed back. There are 3 points we would like to reflect.Implementation of ECVET is improving rapidly. Being part of the strategic partnership EMEU has fuelled the process. The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules. The transfer is both within each department and across department \u2013 for instance between ICT and painters who are now also included in the EMEU Network. The Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened. Using the Module concept across educations makes it realistic that all students at some point in their education will attend a module either abroad or together with international students at AARHUS TECH being taught in English.Dissemination of project results needs continuous attention. This is definite an aspect which can still be improved. Therefore, the communication department is also involved in this project as active participants. It is the aim that the international strategy in the future also will include a dissemination strategy involving the communication department.", "http://www.solihull.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA116-022193_3"], ["3PZ", "European Mobility project for apprentices and young professionnals - Tour de France", "The Work Placement Agency", 1545713.0, "The European Union is constantly moving forwards and the skills development of our European workers has become essential. Companies are now dealing with international exchanges and facing multinational competition. Qualifications and skills are therefore put into question. In order to contribute to this expansion, it is primordial to provide each apprentice with the possibility to be trained and to work on a European level. It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Les Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and make every effort to value on-the-job training and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and the sharing of knowledge. \r\n\r\nLong term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. Part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d syllabus gives the opportunity for our journeymen and journeywomen to have a one-year work experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 6700 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.\r\n\r\nWe have also had the opportunity to allow, since 2004, almost 16100 apprentices to benefit from a 3 week mobility project within the European Union, combining all trade sectors (industry, construction, baking, leather and textiles trades). \r\n\r\nIn order to institutionalize our actions, we manage to officially integrate the 3 week mobility project in to the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract for all our level 4 apprentices since 2009. \r\n\r\nFor 2018-2020, we would like to maintain this momentum and keep the objectives shared under our strategic development plan by sending again more than 1000 apprentices on group mobility projects together with their VET trainer (110 groups in total), 180 post-apprentices for a long term mobility (one year), 108 apprentices for 3-months to 9-months individual mobility \u2013sharing time between a company and a VET center in the host country, 60 post-apprentices on 2-week technical training courses and manage two different job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these actions Les Compagnons du Devoir are continually aiming to improve and since 2016 we have put in place our own quality management processes developed through the ISO 9001 certification. \r\n\r\nThe quality of our mobility projects relies greatly on the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest precise programs compatible with the apprentices\u2019 syllabus in France and with the specificities of the host country. This approach guarantees the relevance of our programs and reassures the employers of our apprentices, who could be concerned about the benefit of a mobility outside France.\r\nThese projects will allow the participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills as apprenticeships and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. \r\n\r\nOur partners involved in these projects are VET centers, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organizations in over 20 countries. Mobility is more and more recognized in these countries, therefore most work placements will be renewed year after year. \r\nYears of experience with our partners allows us to organize our projects with mutual trust and better prepare each participant for their mobility.\r\n\r\nEach participant\u2019s skills and competences gained abroad will be validated by the European partner and the French VET trainer on our online training platform \u201cAquisav\u201d.
