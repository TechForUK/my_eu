Ltd", "It is clear that group (batch) identification is not an adequate method to trace sheep movements across the EU, as the Foot & Mouth outbreak in 2001 demonstrated. Once animals move through different holdings, farms, or markets, it is very difficult to track where each animal is going without individual identification and recording. Should there be a disease outbreak the uncontrolled movement of animals could cause the further and rapid spread of disease over a large geographical area. Therefore the tracing of each individual animal is vitally important to control infectious diseases. However, compliance with the EC legislation for 100% assured tracking of livestock is difficult to deliver with the current mandated LF systems, having a reported recall of only 90% of tagged sheep in group movement situations. This non-compliance could potentially result in financial penalties of up to 50% of individual farm subsidies. The ROSEI project will develop an RFID tagging system offering a robust & reliable solution enabling 100% recall of tagged sheep in flock conditions. The proposed LF & UHF dual band solution  will have longer range & faster read rates for seamless flock and herd scanning enabling the farmers to comply with the strict legislation for Sheep monitoring & tracking.

However, current tracking systems that use low-frequency (LF) radio frequency ID (RFID) tags have a reported success rate below 90\u00a0% when groups of animals are moved.\n\nNow, the EU-funded 'Robust sheep electronic identification' (http://www.rosei.eu (ROSEI)) project is tasked with developing an RFID system with 100\u00a0% tracking efficiency. Project researchers hope to achieve this using a dual-band LF and ultra-high frequency (UHF) system.\n\nROSEI first completed a study of user needs in the sheep industry to inform a full analysis of system requirements. The design of the ROSEI database has been completed, and a combined UHF/LF passive RFID tag prototype has been built. \n\nResearchers developed and optimised the tag antenna through testing of different design variants on sheep. Additionally, a new type of RFID reader has been designed and built that can detect multiple RFID signals in a specific area.\n\nThe project will now focus on integrating the new RFID tag into an existing commercial tag design.

Currently our understanding of how viral, ecological, environmental, and climatic factors affect disease transmission and outbreaks is limited.

This demonstrates the urgent need for effective control strategies to protect children. To prevent spread of dengue, the EU-funded 'Innovative tools and strategies for surveillance and control of dengue' (DENGUETOOLS) project has brought together leading experts in the field.\n\nAs a first step, the consortium set up a laboratory-based surveillance system in Sri Lanka, which includes hospitals, outpatient settings and households. Thousands of samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the virus, including field-collected adult mosquitoes. Additional assays were also developed for point-of-care detection of dengue in endemic areas.\n\nAs an intervention against dengue transmission to school children, scientists proposed the use of insecticide impregnated uniforms. However, the repellent efficacy drops upon repeated washing indicating the need for further optimisation.\n\nConsiderable part of the project is dedicated to the understanding of vector density, capacity and the preferred breeding sites. In various European countries, the consortium studied the impact of insecticidal aerosols on mosquitoes. They are working on associating temperature fluctuations with the risk of a dengue outbreak. Ongoing work to evaluate the risk of transporting dengue should complete the disease risk mapping.\n\nUsing a well-designed population-based system, the DENGUETOOLS initiative proposed to monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of dengue. This is central for warning against epidemic transmission and identifying the priority areas for intervention. Furthermore, the generated predictive models and maps should help policymakers in Europe to better prepare for and control dengue in the future.

We intend to make young people work close to together to develop a strategic partnership initiative that aims to be maintained over time.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this project is to establish the basis for consolidating a cooperation structure with two other European entities, a British and a French that is capable of generating a comic to spread into new local events, regional, national and international. We want vertebrar international interpersonal networks that encourage youth participation in activities at European level through concrete action with a veneer to stabilize over time and allows importing the good practices developed by our partners, and export our expertise. With this initiative, which is based on social entrepreneurship, it is also intended that participating associations are able to give birth to a common border and landscape project for the creation of an initiative in several languages to communicate Europe through the language of comics. This initiative member associations provide resources, materials, know-how and learning to communicate Europe more and more effectively when they are sent to other young people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main added value of cross-border nature of the project is broader than will and the uniqueness of its approach, making better translate its cultural imprint. Our world today is globalized and cultural phenomena that become fashionable, as the Superheroes. However, they tend to have a distinct national character and mostly come from non-European countries. This initiative aims to highlight the commonality through identification with a superhero that can only be European if from his own conception youth involved in their creation of several countries. Furthermore, when generating versions in several languages and try to penetrate several markets at once, there is no better way to have people already own country working on the ground.", "http://yem.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-3-ES02-KA205-009060_1"], ["4DX", "Escuela de Liderazgo Innovaci\u00f3n Ciudadan\u00eda Europea Online: Europa en la Escuela!", "Young European Movement Ltd", 24422.0, "Europe is part of everyday life for European citizens, but this cross-cutting nature is not reflected in academic curricula. The E-LICEO program, an acronym for \"School of Leadership, Innovation and European Citizenship Online\", is an initiative that seeks to fill a gap in the school curriculum of Spanish students, who barely deal with issues related to the European Union in Their centers. Thus, neither primary education nor compulsory secondary education deals with issues related to Europe, nor does it occur in post-compulsory education, that is, in training cycles, baccalaureate or university, except in the case of specific courses.\r\nIn a collateral way, this program aims to strengthen the access of Spanish youth to the opportunities that the EU has created these years (such as programs such as Erasmus Plus and Euroscola), but remain underutilized, expanding the impact, to the extent Of all possible Spanish territory. We intend to create a network of trainers on European issues in schools and universities. With this project we seek to establish the bases to have the necessary resources to consolidate this structure and that it will be able to generate new local, regional, national and international events that will bring together international interpersonal networks that encourage the participation of the young Spaniards in the activities of European level. In this way, we intend to contribute to strengthening the associative fabric focused on European themes and with the vocation to organize events so that the young Spaniards can integrate and participate, developing capacities that are very necessary in the new multicultural environments.\r\nAs a necessary complement to this face-to-face work with students, in the digital world in which we live it is necessary to complete the face-to-face training of students with online courses that prolong the activity developed in direct contact. In this way, we intend to consolidate the action carried out in person with a possible online follow-up, at the same time as we open the possibility for training on Europe to anyone who is interested in the issue, expanding our scope.\r\nThe association that presents this project, the Young Europeans and Federalists of Spain, we have more than 35 years of experience working the question of Europeanism with the young Spaniards. For more than three years we have given talks in secondary schools and universities to raise awareness of the opportunities that Europe offers to young people. On this occasion we decided to bring together a group of associations that, like ours, have also been working on these issues for several years.", "http://yem.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-ES02-KA205-010022_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4JB", "BROOK STREET (UK) LIMITED", 44638.0, "External personnel \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.02.03)", "fts_2017_57074", 2017], ["5UG", "ETHER NDE LIMITED", 43613.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_58118", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "AL1"}
