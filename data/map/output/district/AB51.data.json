The project targets a multitude of forest owners and stakeholders to spread integrated, transferable solutions and viable policies to unlock immobile forest resources and ensure sustainable forest functions. A novel pan-European Information System, the \u2018MOBILISER\u2019, is a unique knowledge base of innovative practices and technologies, existing stakeholder initiatives and effective support programmes in the regions and an expert system to evaluate the impact of up-scaling solutions to the larger EU context. The MOBILISER links to Regional Learning Labs, fostering participative dialogues on enhanced forest governance to secure collaborative initiatives and build commitment for improved policies and solu-tions of sustainable development. As a proof-of-concept, SME partners jointly implement novel pilot projects showcasing targeted forest use and tangible impacts on rural economies. This European Information System incorporates a broad dissemination strategy via easily accessible, intuitive, multilingual interfaces to maximize the uptake of integrated mobilisation solutions by forest owners and stakeholders across Europe and beyond. The two major European research organisations, JRC and EFI, facilitate the wide transfer and ensure continuity of the cross-regional monitoring system beyond the project\u2019s lifetime. The project will help overcome socio-economic and technical barriers linked to ownership fragmentation and develop major opportunities in expanding wood and bioenergy markets. Focused recommendations and future RTD priorities underpin vital policy areas on multiple levels and raise awareness for wood mobilisation initiatives. Overall the project secures increased supplies of wood, enhances sustainable forest use and strengthens the forest-based sector as a key contributor to Europe\u2019s growing bioeconomy.", 138774.0, 5994219.0, "SIMWOOD", null, null, null, "http://simwood.efi.int/", "http://www.ruraldevelopment.org.uk", null, "fp7_110708_951173271"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8YE", "Language Training", "Rothienorman Primary School", 3515.0, "Project Background;Education Scotland aims to ensure that every child, from P1 onwards, should have the opportunity to learn a foreign language. This policy, the 1+2 Language Initiative, is to be fully implemented by 2020. In Rothienorman Primary School we have decided our first foreign language is to be French. This ensures progression into secondary school where the MFL taught to senior 2 and beyond is French too.In order to meet the requirements of the new, national initiative we plan to up-skill two primary teachers at Rothienorman Primary School in the French language and in foreign language teaching methodologies, so that we can more effectively embed the language into the curriculum. This will be achieved through attendance at an 8 day immersion course based in France, coordinated by LFEE.Attendance at this course will;- Improve the delivery of new national foreign languages initiative at a school, cluster and council level- Help develop connections with national colleagues and partners abroad thus improving cultural awareness and developing an understanding of European and global citizenship- Encourage children to use ICT resources to communicate with partners abroad so that the new curriculum is meaningful and a motivating experience for our pupilsParticipants' profiles;Caroline Palmer;  - Aged 38  - Motivated primary school teacher with more than 7 years teaching experience  - Studied French to a higher level and has since refreshed prior learning for both work and leisure  - Currently teaching French to Primary 2/3 composite class by embedding learning into daily routines and by using a range of active       learning games, (including through the use of ICT)Amanda M MacLean;  - Age 24 years  - Motivated primary school teacher, relatively new in my teaching experiences  - Studied French to standard grade level but have been refreshing my memory teaching my class and through using Duo Lingo app      on my phoneIt is anticipated that all other staff within the school, and a good number of staff within cluster and beyond will benefit through activities such as the sharing of resources and ongoing training opportunities. Likewise, all 136 primary-aged children at Rothienorman (and a great number beyond), will benefit from the transference of skills between colleagues and the provision of ideas and resources in order to make the teaching of French a more varied and meaningful experience. Results will be disseminated within school, cluster, council and nationally through a range of media (for example online), and the impact of the training course will likewise have benefits for the participant, their school, cluster, council and national authority too. The primary impact will be the greatly improved knowledge and confidence of the course attendees, and how their learning can be used to inspire the learning of pupils at Rothienorman School and the teaching of those they are able to support (both within school and beyond), with their newly acquired learning. The links created will help all involved to realise the nature of our place within Europe, develop greater understanding between nations and ultimately improve societal and industrial progress in the long term, as the children we teach carry their learning into adulthood.", "http://www.rothinonorman.aberdeenshire.sch.uk", "Rothienorman Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023837_coordinator"], ["0EZ", "Optimized Training - Innovative Methods and tools for Acceptance of prior Learning in qualifications and workplace training", "Polaris Learning Ltd", 305589.0, "Background:The Optimal partner countries, NO, UK, IR and FR, have set ambitious fish farming production growth targets, increasing the demand from fish production and supply companies for job-seekers with proven expertise and competence. The current generation of farm operatives must develop the skills to operate increasingly sophisticated fish farming equipment and ICT systems, according to specifications, as a matter of urgency. The lack of job applicants with evidence of the competence and skills potential employers are looking for is a shared concern.  Many do have relevant knowledge and skills which have been gained during fish farm employment informally or within a technically related sector, that go unrecognised, compounding the problem. Sophisticated systems for the recognition of prior learning (RPL) are needed, so as learners with some experience can \u2018fast track\u2019 the completion of fish farming qualifications that employers respect and trust. Profile of participants:The partner countries VET providers and employers will work in partnership to develop and pilot learning technologies and methods that can improve the delivery of VET to work based learners through the application of RPL methods and technologies. All learners involved in the pilots will have gained some relevant and/or transferable knowledge and skills, informally, during their employment, but will also have significant knowledge and skills gaps to address. Such gaps in knowledge and skills result in heterogeneous VET classes, which are a serious challenge many VET teachers are faced with when they try to optimize learning outcome for work based learners in distance learning solutions consisting of a combination of e-learning and (some) face to face training.The introduction of RPL will leads to individualised learning, allowing teachers and instructors to focus on the most challenging topics and concepts with individuals or groups of learners. The RPL tools and methods can be applied to synchronous distance learning, overcoming the geographic barriers that often prohibit them from travelling to join conventional face to face classes and training sessions. Objectives: The ultimate goal of Optimal, is to develop a RPL system that enables an individual\u2019s informal competences and skills to become recognised and accepted, within fish farming qualifications and built on through individualised learning.  This will be achieved by: - Evaluating alternative RPL processes and technology being applied within innovative VET delivery systems within the partner countries, identifying best practice for sharing. - Piloting new, cost effective and user friendly RPL methods/ ICT tools that can determine and document evidence of a learners\u2019 existing knowledge and skills, for acceptance as formal competences within respected fish farming qualifications.  - Evaluating the learners\u2019 experiences of the RPL process and the subsequent delivery of their individualised learning plan, to inform the development of improved RPL systems. - Developing new specifications for improved RPL tools and methodologies, informed by learner and employer feedback during the piloting and evaluation phase. ImpactsMethods and technology supporting RPL and individualised learning will be developed and improved, fully involving VET providers, industry and learners within the process, addressing industry\u2019s skill needs priorities for key occupations, such as the cage farming operative.More VET teachers will be enabled to apply improved and proven RPL methods and technology to the delivery of their VET courses,  to make them more flexible. Consequently, VET will become driven by individual learning plans and supported by flexible and accessible learning resources, including e-learning. A 90% reduction of face to face teaching is anticipated, improving the accessibility of VET qualification based courses by work based learners, gaining time efficiencies and reducing costs without reducing quality in comparison to conventional face to face delivery. By focussing on individual knowledge and skill gaps, the quality and effectiveness of learning support and VET provision as a whole will be raised. Long term benefits:Access to workplace training in fish farming industry is increased, while training costs are reduced without reducing the quality of the training.The proposed new RPL-TOOL has the potential to be used in many sectors outside VET education, for instance in higher education to make an \"instant mapp\" of students knowledge and skills. Teachers may afterwards immediately adjust and adapt the training activities such that they reflect students knowledge and competence.", "http://www.polaris-learning.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA202-022106_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "AB51"}
