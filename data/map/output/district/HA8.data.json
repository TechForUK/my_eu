This will slow the patients\u2019 cognitive and functional decline, avoid carers getting exhausted and reduce costs of emergency care.\n\nOur project will comprise two phases: first we will use digital accessibility tools to re-design the existing application for dementia patients. The development will be steered by patients, carers and doctors, through user-centric design: we will collect feedback on each new version of the application until the design is perfectly adapted to the users\u2019 needs.
