In this context, the development of high efficiency motors using a limited amount of permanent magnets or completely new magnet-free motor designs is crucial. A promising option for this new generation of electric motors could be reluctance technology, which has been left out of the first line up to now due to its lower power density when compared to PM motors. On the other hand, the use of axial-flux configurations has proved recently in PM motors that power density can be increased in a relatively cost-effective way. The combination of both approaches, reluctance motors in axial-flux configuration, could lead to power densities comparable to those of PM motors in current EV-s while minimizing (PM assisted synchronous reluctance motors, PMSynRM) or avoiding (switched reluctance motors, SRM) the usage of scarce magnet materials. The aim of this project is to develop both axial-flux SRMs and PMSynRMs in parallel (meeting EV power density requirements), exploiting their commonalities and synergies in the design and prototyping phases, to further opt for the most suitable solution to be integrated in commercial EV-s. Being the combination of reluctance technology and axial-flux configuration a completely novel approach for EV applications (SRMs) and for any kind of application in general (PMSynRMs), one of the main challenges of the project will be to get a cost-effective and high efficiency motor design, considering a potential large scale manufacturing and industrialization of this new generation of motors.'", 35254.0, 2293915.0, "VENUS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110532_960580234"], ["8FB", "Demonstration of integrated smart water supply solutions at 4 sites across Europe", "Syrinix Limited", "European water utilities face many problems related to their 3,5 million km\u2019s of distribution networks.

The outcomes of this project will enable both these imperatives to be achieved simultaneously.  The project aim is to establish production lines in Europe that manufacture components for lightweight complex-shaped automobile body structures that are significantly lighter and of comparable strength and stiffness to those currently available.\nThis will be achieved by exploiting a new patented thermo-mechanical processing technology (HFQ) for sheet aluminium alloy that enables, for the first time, parts in heat treatable alloys to be produced to net-shape with maximum attainable mechanical properties. The life-cycle energy consumption of automobiles will be reduced; in the production stage, by the low energy requirements of HFQ, which is enhanced by the potential use of low cost recycled raw material and in the driving stage, by the reduced fuel consumption associated with lightweight vehicles. Reduced pollution is a natural corollary of low energy consumption.\nExploitation of this groundbreaking technology will be achieved through refinement of its laboratory scale development by university, research institution and manufacturing SME collaboration, leading to production lines being established in Tier 1 companies. Two such lines are anticipated as an outcome of the project. In 8 year period, over 30 production lines will be established in Europe and over 1000 jobs could be created.

We believe that disabled people should have the freedom to live their lives the way they choose - with the opportunity and support to live independently, to contribute economically, and to participate fully in society. The needs and aspirations of disabled people are at the heart of what we do. The EVS project will take place in The Grove, the Leonard Cheshire care home located 6 miles south from Norwich.  The project involve 2 volunteers from Italy and Greece and will last 12 months with start date in September 2016. The volunteers selected for this project have background in disability studies and some experience supporting people with disability. They are great candidates with the right among of experience and interest in disability issues, and they both wish to continue working towards bettering the conditions and rights for people with disability.The main aim of the project stands in line with Leonard Cheshire organisational goal: to ensure that residents are provided with the opportunity to live their lives the way they choose - with the support to live independently. The project will in turn raise awareness of disability issues as it is expected that the volunteers will gain more knowledge of disability, and that the residents will become more visible and active in the local community.Specific objectives of the project include:1. To assist with activities (the most typical activities are arts and crafts, music, games, quizzes)2. To accompany groups of people living with disability on excursions in the community3. To take the lead in organising fundraising activity at The Grove, or in the local community. 4. To take responsibility for organising regular (fortnightly) activity.5.

Our volunteers are actively involved in shaping their EVS experiences by developing the activities plan with residents and staff. We encourage volunteers to bring their own ideas, skills and passions to share with residents. As a result, the role is varied depending on their own skills and interests, and the needs of residents and the activities they like to engage in. Our residents make sure their home has a lively atmosphere with activities such art and craft workshops, quizzes, IT workshops, music group, cooking and gardening. The care homes also organise special events such as fundraisers, holiday celebrations, cultural evenings or sports nights. Volunteers also support on social outings, day trips and educational events such as attending college classes. Hence the delivery of activities is heavily influenced by the skills and motivation of our volunteers to design a creative and fun activity programme.EVS volunteers have lasting impact on many different aspects of our service users\u2019 lives. Volunteers enable disabled people to be more independent, enjoy a greater choice of activities and form a healthy social relationship. The expected impact of project on the residents is that the diversity of activities and enhanced individual support will encourage residents to set new goals and be more open to try new things and in particular to contribute more to the local communiThe local community learn more about other cultures and disability.  With support from EVS volunteers we are able to host more  local social events that spread the EVS program and disability issues, as well as creates a warm and welcoming environment within our care homes.  An active and varied social life for our residents is often key to their health, happiness and quality of life.  Thus the impact of the EVS project at addresses a very basic human need of developing real and meaningful relationships, which is a fantastic result. The expected impact of the project for the volunteers is to become ambassadors for disability issues. It is expected that the participants will continue to promote disability rights and work towards a society that values disabled and non-disabled people equally.
