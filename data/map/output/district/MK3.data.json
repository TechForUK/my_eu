Europe is developing payload concepts for drilling and sample analysis, a contribution to a 250kg rover as well as for sample return. To achieve these missions, ESA depends on international partnerships.\nSuch missions will be seldom, expensive and the drill/sample site selected will be based on observations from orbit not calibrated with ground truth data.\nMany of the international science community\u2019s objectives can be met at lower cost, or the chances of mission success improved and the quality of the science increased by making use of an innovative, low mass, mobile payload following the LEAG recommendations.\nThis smart payload when used alone will accurately determine lunar volatile distribution over a wide area, including PSR\u2019s, as well as providing ground truth data to calibrate orbital observations. If two, or more, smart payloads are deployed, a greater area will be covered. If the smart payload is used as a scout for ESA\u2019s planned 250kg drilling rover or sample return mission, sampling locations of higher value will be identified.\nThe main innovation is to develop an in situ sampling technology capable of depth-resolved extraction of volatiles, and then to package within this tool, the analyser itself, so as to maximise transfer efficiency and minimise sample handling and its attendant mass requirements and risk of sample alteration. By building on national, EC and ESA funded research and developments, this project will develop to TRL6 instruments that together form a smart modular mobile payload that could be flight ready in 2020.\nThis instrument will be tested in a highly representative environment including thermal, vacuum and regolith simulant and the integrated payload demonstrated in a representative environment.\nA roadmap, complemented by an innovative PPP funding approach, for the implementation of the LUVMI flight model will also be developed.", 96463.0, 1314357.0, "LUVMI", null, null, null, "https://www.luvmi.space/", null, null, "h2020_205949_921020239"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6DP", "H\u00f8jtbegavede og talentfulde b\u00f8rn i indskoling og p\u00e5 mellemtrin - udfordring og succes.", "The National Association for Gifted Children", 7126.0, "Interskolen would like to expand their scholastic offerings regarding their gifted and talented students, especially with regard to the younger children.\r\nIn Denmark, there are only a few offers available for this group of children, and these are solely for the older students (Danish grades 7-9). There are no offers related to the younger children (Danish grades 0.-6).\r\nWe would therefore, like to have one of our teachers obtain the competence to both undertake the guidance of the gifted and talented students in grade 0-6 and to obtain the skills to guide the staff at the school (both teachers and personnel from the after-school activities (SFO)). This person will also have contact with the parents of the gifted and talented students.\r\nIt is the school\u2019s ambition that every child \u2013 also gifted and talented \u2013 is to be challenged to meet their individual potential. To challenge the gifted and talented children academically can be a challenge in itself.\r\nThis group of children often has difficulties in their social relations as well as fitting into \u201cthe normal classroom\u201d.\r\nThe end result is that these children often don\u2019t fulfil their potential or go as far in the educational system as their abilities allow them to. They often end up being underachievers who often do not reach their full potential.\r\nIt is important to support and nurture these children from an early age. Recent research shows that they have already, by 4th grade, achieved far below their potential level.\r\n\r\nOur intent with this project is to get a person within this field to obtain competence, both within the theory of teaching these children, and within the emotional area of dealing with gifted and talented children. We would also like to obtain experience with the practice of teaching these children through visits to schools that have different programs regarding the gifted and talented.\r\nOn the basis of all the above reasons, we have put together a project that consists of visits to various organizations that: \r\na) work with the daily challenges of teaching this group of children \u2013 both as an integrated part of a \u201cnormal\u201d class \u2013 and as a group consisting of only these type of children.\r\nb) work with supporting the well-being of these children and focus on the relationships between the gifted, talented and the average children.\r\nApart from these visits, we have chosen a university-based course that will give our participant a strong theoretical background within this area.\r\nA smaller group of staff, both teachers and the personnel of the principal\u2019s office, will, furthermore, be going on a course to work on the school\u2019s strategy and specialization within the gifted and talented children area. On this course there will also be a short introduction on working with this particular group of children.\r\nThe teacher who will be in charge of the gifted and talented area at Interskolen has been chosen based on professional and personal competence, plus has a profound interest in this area. The participant is a teacher of both Danish and music at the school, and has a line of creative competences in the humanistic field. She has initiated several projects in the past few years concerning the gifted and talented at the school and is in charge of a recently started \u201cmentor-project\u201d between students in different grades.\r\nSome of the project\u2019s activities will involve several participants. These will be chosen later based on function within the school, personal competence and an interest within the area.\r\n\r\nOur goal with this project is to maintain and develop a school, where every student is met on their own level and are given the optimal nurturement and support to fulfil their individual potential. To do this we need new knowledge, new experience and a network with other schools in order to develop programmes and scholastic offerings regarding our gifted and talented students.", "http://www.potentialplusuk.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DK01-KA101-004094_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK3"}
