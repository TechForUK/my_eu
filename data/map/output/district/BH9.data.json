Future educators, nursery nurses, care workers, apprentices in the hotel and hospitality trade will travel abroad to improve their intercultural, vocational and language skills. \r\nProject aims: The aim is to increase the European mobility of future employees. Things that we have in common and things that are different in the respective countries are the topic of ensuing discussions. Automatically, the foreign language skills, the social competences as well as the personal and vocational skills will improve. Many former participants said that they realized that also their professional skills are  international. There has been a lively exchange of methods and ideas with regard to activities with children in the nursery school which increased the self-confidence of participants as an equal partner for the British colleagues. Number and profile of participants: approx. 86 participants. Of those 20 future educators, 6 erasmus pro longterm work experience, 15 nursery nurses, 27 apprentices from the hotel and hospitality sector, 10 students who train to be careworkers for people with special needs, 8 teachers of English as a foreign language and technology teachers are scheduled to participate. \r\nActivities: Vocational work placements in nursery schools, in restaurants and kitchens and practical training sessions in the colleges of our project partners, as well as immersion courses for our EFL teachers.\r\nProject management: many years of experience with similar projects, constant improvements after evaluation and feedback with our partners.\r\nExpected results/effects/longterm benefit: Our vocational college will benefit with regard to its profile compared to other schools. The work placement abroad will provide additional qualifications for our students, it will improve language skills, and practical work experience which is an additional asset on the European job market. It also improves the staff qualification with regard to intercultural skills, the European dimension, language competence, teaching methods, CLIL-skills and to expand the network of international partners. It also improves the profile of our vocational school and the participating partners in the dual apprenticeship sector of hotels and restaurants in our area. Without the Erasmus+ programme many of our students would not be able to gain this work experience abroad. The EU grant makes it possible that also financially and socially disadvantaged students can participate.", "http://englishlearninghomestays.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004571_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH9"}
