OpenNESS will therefore develop innovative and practical ways of applying them in land, water and urban management: it will identify how, where and when the concepts can most effectively be applied to solve problems. To do this, it will work with public and private decision makers and stakeholders to better understand the range of policy and management problems faced in different case study contexts (ranging across locales, sectors, scales and time). OpenNESS will consolidate, refine and develop a range of spatially-explicit methods to identify, quantify and value ecosystem services, and will develop hybrid assessment methods. It will also explore the effectiveness of financial and governance mechanisms, such as payments for ecosystem services, habitat banking, biodiversity offsetting and land and ecosystem accounting. These types of interventions have potential for sustaining ESS and NC, and for the design of new economic and social investment opportunities. Finally, OpenNESS will assess how current regulatory frameworks and other institutional factors at EU and national levels enable or constrain consideration of ESS and NC, and identify the implications for issues related to well-being, governance and competitiveness. OpenNESS will analyse the knowledge that is needed to define ESS and NC in the legal, administrative and political contexts that are relevant to the EU. The work will deliver a menu of multi-scale solutions to be used in real life situations by stakeholders, practitioners, and decision makers in public and business organizations, by providing new frameworks, data-sets, methods and tools that are fit-for-purpose and sensitive to the plurality of decision-making contexts.", 24886.0, 9234536.0, "OPENNESS", "Turning the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capital into practice", "Despite improved understanding of the links between ecosystem health, provision of ecosystem services and human well-being, the concepts of ecosystem services and natural capital are still hard to apply operationally to policy and management problems.", "Humans benefit from ecosystems in many ways, such as the provision of clean water, the decomposition of waste, and the pollination of crops by bees and other insects. These direct contributions of ecosystems to human well-being are known as ecosystem services (ES). Natural capital (NC) refers to those elements of nature that directly or indirectly produce value for people, including soil, air, water and all living things.\n\nThe http://www.openness-project.eu (OPENNESS) project translates both concepts into operational frameworks that provide tested, practical and tailored solutions for integration into land, water and urban management and decision-making. It examines how the concepts link to, and support, EU sectoral and cross-sectoral policy initiatives and scrutinizes its potential and limitations.\n\nCentral to OPENNESS is a multi-scale case study approach, designed to ground ideas and theories on real-world observations and analysis. To do this, we work with public and private decision-makers and stakeholders to better understand the range of problems faced in 26 different case study contexts.\n\nThe OPENNESS team identified 20 key EU policies that will benefit from the project's findings, such as the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the Water Framework Directive and the Renewable Energy Directive. In addition, OPENNESS will help mainstreaming the concepts of ES and NC into land-use practices and forest management processes.\n\nThe multi-scale solutions that will come out of OPENNESS will deliver stakeholder-targeted options for ES assessments in real-life planning and decision-making situations. A menu of such solutions will be central to Oppla, the common platform that is developed together with the OPERAs project.

However, in Europe, and around the globe, bees face many threats and are often in decline as a result. One potential driver of reduced bee health is agrochemicals. While laboratory and semi-field studies suggest that such chemicals negatively impact bee health, their importance and relevance in the real world remains unclear. PoshBee is a consortium of academics, governmental organisations, industry, and NGOs that will address the issue of agrochemicals to ensure the sustainable health of bees and their pollination services in Europe. Integrating the knowledge and experience of local beekeeping and farming organisations and academic researchers (including the EU RefLab for bee health), we will provide the first comprehensive pan-European assessment of the exposure hazard of chemicals, their mixtures, and co-occurrence with pathogens and nutritional stress for solitary, bumble, and honey bees across two major cropping systems. Integrated studies across the lab-to-field axis will determine the effect of chemicals, their mixtures, and interactions with pathogens and nutrition on bee health. We will combine the skills of commercial bumble bee and solitary bee producers, ecotoxicological industry, and academics to develop new model species and innovative protocols for testing chemicals in bees. With MUST-B, we will integrate this information to develop dynamic landscape environmental risk assessment models for bees. Using proteomics, we will produce new molecular markers for assessing bee health and enabling long-term monitoring schemes. Finally, combining across our partners and stakeholder board, we will deliver practice- and policy-relevant research outputs to local, national, European, and global stakeholders.

Context/background of project.The Scottish Government has set out a strategy for education that sees foreign language  learning as a crucial part of preparing young people for the future in a global society.  It is clear, therefore, that realising such an initiative requires high quality training and development of teachers and all staff involved in educating young people. The mobility project being applied for in this case will deliver this high quality training and enable Spanish to become more widely taught at Kinross High School and within its feeder primary schools. 2. Objectives of the project.The key objectives of the project are:i) To improve the participants' competence and performance in Spanish at all levelsii) To build upon the participant's experience and expertise in the teaching and learning of Spanish across the age and ability rangeiii) To gain new ideas and stimulating and current teaching materials which can be used in the classroom  iv) To develop expertise in using ICT, songs, music, media and other authentic resources in the teaching of Spanishv) To develop cultural awareness and a deeper understanding of contemporary Spain and learn about the education system in particularvi) To share ideas and good practice with other teachers from Scotland, the UK  and other European countries.3. Number and profile of participants.There is one participant applying for this course. The participant is a very experienced teacher of Modern Languages with a degree in French/ Russian  (1991) and a more recently acquired Graduate Diploma in Spanish (2014). The participant continually engages in all aspects of Professional Development through inservice training events in school, within the cluster schools and other national training events. The participant continues to develop her own skills and competencies in Spanish independently at home as well as undertaking one-to-one Spanish oral classes outwith school on a fortnightly basis in order to continually improve oral confidence with spoken Spanish. The participant has significant experience of middle leadership in several schools.4. Activities.During the 3 week immersion course in Spain participants will attend intensive Spanish classes on a daily basis with an emphasis on the spoken language. Participants will be expected to engage in activities based around teaching and learning, creating materials to use in the classroom, ICT  and participating in other linguistic tasks. A full programme of cultural excursions is provided including evening trips out to Spanish restaurants , cinema or theatre. All activities are designed to maximise opportunities for listening to and speaking Spanish.5. Methodology.A record will be kept of all activities undertaken throughout the project. On return to school a timetable for monitoring and evaluation will be drawn up and integrated into the existing Departmental Improvement Plan and the Whole School Improvement Plan. The participant along with the Principal Teacher (ML) and SMT will be responsible for undertaking and recording the impact of all relevant activities associated with this.6. Results and impact.The results of the project will impact the following groups as follows:-PERSONAL A gain in confidence to teach Spanish within the classroom. The ability to teach all age ranges and abilities.-PUPILS Increased motivation of pupils and continued improvements in learning outcomes for pupils in Spanish.-MODERN LANGUAGES DEPARTMENT The sharing of new ideas, methodologies and  resources with colleagues.-KINROSS HIGH SCHOOL developing  European dimension of curriculum across the school via E-twinning and/or partner school link for creating interdisciplinary projects, email links, teacher exchanges , work experience abroad etc.-PRIMARY SCHOOLS sharing knowledge and expertise gained with primary colleagues to help support and deliver Spanish at primary level.PARENTS AND WIDER COMMUNITY sharing the project outcomes via school website, community newsletter, parent information evening and the business community.-PERTH AND KINROSS COUNCIL sharing information from the project with other colleagues in cluster schools and through modern languages inservice events.7.
