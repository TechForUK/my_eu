The modular platform will enable the design of diverse active nanosystems per diagnostic or therapeutic application as defined by their active agent compositions. For diagnostics, superior tracers will be developed for molecular MR/PET and gamma camera imaging, enabling efficient diagnosis and guided surgery respectively. Novel functionalized nano-core systems will be conjugated with semi-confluent active shell layer. Three types of shell layers will be design: (1) novel iron oxide nanoparticles as advanced MRI contrast agents and/or (2) DOTA complexes for MRI (with Gd3\\), or PET (with Ga-68), or gamma camera (with Ga-69); (3) Integrating within one tracer both iron oxide nanoparticles and DOTA-Ga-68 complexes for a sequential or simultaneous MR/PET imaging. For therapeutics, active nanosystems will be developed to deliver (1) therapeutic siRNAs or (2) anti-MP-inhibitory-scFVs. These non-classic anti-tumor drugs will be designed based on an extensive tumor degradome analysis for combining blockage of selective matrix MPs, thus preventing basic invasive and metastasis steps, with siRNA based neutralization of secondary molecular effects induced by the specific protease inhibition. Individualized degradome analysis will be developed for potential profiling of anti-MP and siRNAs based therapy per patient. To facilitate the above diagnostics and therapeutic effects, advanced tumor targeting and penetration active agents will be linked to nano-core functionalized groups, including a biocompatible PEG layer linked to tumor selective MMP substrate molecules and highly safe and potent novel somatostatin analogue peptides targeting SSTR overexpression.", 298538.0, 11482642.0, "SAVEME", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nhance-technologies.co.uk/", null, "fp7_98079_975090464"], ["0BY", "Develop and demonstrate a \u2018Mini-factory\u2019 concept for production of personalized skin care products for elderly population", "nHance Technologies Limited", "Skin alterations within ageing are significant and visible, and therefore disturbing feature in the quality of life of aged people.

In the absence of more targeted measures, after the first phases of reception, the new refugees risk being marginalized by the social and production community, falling victims to criminal activities.The MILAR project fosters the learning and testing of a new route towards the employability of refugees, adopting the model of Social Community Enterprise (SCE), at transnational level and in local communities in Italy, Sweden, Germany, and England.SCEs, innovative but still relatively unexplored experiences, consist of a set of economic and social activities which are defined as \u2018hybrid\u2019, i.e. not supported by a single stakeholder/body but rather by multi-stakeholder networks (public and private, profit and no-profit stakeholders), sharing the same collective need, such as for example providing jobs for unemployed people. This results in multisector (agriculture, tourism, environment, etc.) micro-projects which are mutually functional, and of both volunteer and commercial/productive nature.The partnership aims to experiment \u2018bottom-up\u2019 projects integrating social and production-oriented enterprises, with a view to promoting the labour integration of a heterogeneous target, such as the refugee population in Europe.The project is promoted by training agencies, social organizations, and institutions, all of which are equally involved in the phases of:\u2022        RESEARCH: collection and analysis of successful community welfare experiences and preparation of a transnational research framework \u2022        MODELLING: transnational peer-to-peer training pathway for learning and sharing experiences, with a view to developing the Guidelines for a common model of Social Community Enterprise\u2022       TESTING: in each partner country, testing of Social Community Enterprise projects and of learning pathways for refugees, gathered in a Compendium of experimentations and Toolkits for refugees\u2022        COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION The METHODOLOGY used in MILAR, precisely because it is focused on the community model of social community enterprise, promotes the constant participation and sharing among the partners, towards territorial networks and institutional stakeholders. The multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder development of new learnings - of trainers, refugees, profit and no-profit stakeholders, and local communities involved in experimentation projects, in a dimension which is always set in operational contexts - is promoted on two levels, transnational and local.The DIRECT BENEFICIARIES are:- 11 operators of vocational training in the TRANSNATIONAL MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM;- 30 operators of the partnership and of local networks in the LOCAL MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAMS; - 90 public and private, profit and no-profit stakeholders, in COMMUNITY BUILDING SITES;- 45 REFUGEES. The INDIRECT BENEFICIARIES, reached by communication campaign and multiplier events, are:- 300 ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES;- 2,500 LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS in fields close to the project topics and to the issue of refugees\u2019 inclusion; - 10,000 CITIZENS. The EXPECTED RESULT is a methodological and operational contribution to the increase in the employability of refugees, also through the combined growth, between \u2018specialist\u2019 operators and the economic/productive world, of capabilities and entrepreneurial spirit applied to social inclusion processes.In particular:- Transnational mapping of SCE experiences, fostering an understanding of the purposes of SCE and its possible use on a European scale;- Definition of a model of Social Community Enterprise oriented to the inclusion of refugees, allowing for the translation into ESF/ERDF management regulations and providing tools for the management of SCEs able to generate employment;- Definition of innovative methods (Building sites and Business Canvas) for the executive management of: o Local multi-stakeholder actions of social community enterprises, in socio-economic sectors peculiar for the integration and employability of refugees;o Learning pathways for refugees in informal contexts/on the job.

We all aim at creating and promoting a school with a sense of togetherness and a positive learning atmosphere. Why do we want that? In our different schools there are different problems connected with gender issues that hamper the learning atmosphere and success and a feeling of belonging together. We intend to make gender roles visible, we want to start investigating and drawing attention to this problem and tackle the problems we have discovered. \r\n      Each school will have a different focus addressing specific problems connected with gender issues we have discovered by already having conducted a survey among students. We all will try to find solutions and will present and share our experiences:\r\nThe school in Karlsruhe will tackle the problem that many boys have problems in studying, do less homework and tend to have worse results in tests than girls and will also try to make teachers aware of a sometimes sexist behaviour. \r\nSweden will focus on equal rights (each school in Sweden is obliged to have an equal rights plan) and work against racism, which has increased due to the high percentage of refugees. \r\nThe Bulgarian school will aim to build a bridge between Roma students and their parents  in order to \"emancipate\" these girls and women and make both generations realize the importance of having education and career in order to gain equality in society. \r\nThe French school will focus on the issues of social inequalities and their different repercussions on the schooling and in the education of boys and girls. The gender roles and inequalities will be framed through the questions of homework, housework, sports practised during free time, chosen orientations after school etc. . They will also set up a study hall once a week: voluntary students or parents will participate. \r\nThe English school will focus on improving the independent learning and risk-taking with girls and explore to what extent their learning is different from that of boys. It will aim for the project to be led by the girls themselves in their own exploration of gender issues both at home and abroad.\r\nAfter the first project year, the findings from each school will be presented at the project meeting with students and teachers at the International Forum Burg Liebenzell, Germany. The findings will be shared in the group, so that the other schools can profit from them, thus learning cooperatively. In the second year, each school presents the ideas and the materials from the first project meeting to the rest of their respective schools to implement the ideas they found most useful, with a view to creating a school with optimal learning possibilities for gender. \r\nMoreover, we will all work together on one common topic each year. In the 1st year, we want to reflect on our own gender -investigate important role-models for our students in European history and  in the present. In the 2nd year the schools will examine together gender roles and issues in society and in the media.  All results will be presented at the second project meeting in Strasbourg.\r\nWe will have two teacher meetings. The 1st will take place in Sweden in November 2017, the 2nd in November 2018 in Bulgaria. We will get to know each other, the schools, the exchange including what each school has done and explain what we are going to do by the project meetings. We will ensure that we can evidence the impact of our interventions.  \r\nDuring our project we aim at finding methods (teaching, learning etc.) to tackle the gender-related issues in our schools and change gender-related attitudes and behaviour. Our school policies will be adapted and improved. We will create and use the eTwinning space and exchange our results and products via eTwinning. Furthermore, we will create a project website. A blog will be developed and a newspaper published with a collection of all our findings after the 1st year. During and at the end of the 2nd year our results and findings will be presented in various creative ways: by short films, presentations (prezi, power point), a piece of music or a poem in response to the findings, all presented at our last meeting. The results will be collected on a DVD and published on eTwinning and our websites. \r\n    We will evaluate the students\u2019 and teachers' opinions from all partner schools on the process of the project using questionnaires, interviews, creative forms of evaluation like collages, feedback, flashlight, world caf\u00e9 as well survey - monkey.\r\n    The results of our project will be published and shared with local and European schools and educational organisations.
