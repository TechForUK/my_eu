Our team of schools consists of Pilton a previous winner of 'International Secondary School of the Year' and Braunton full International School Award holders who have been involved in many other funded projects.\r\n\r\nThis project resulted from extensive discussion about a common theme which would have a lasting impact on all our institutions. Discrimination is a problem which has many forms but which affects every school and even community.  The current European climate of migrant acceptance, cyberbullying, bullying, gender equality and the whole prevent strategy has made awareness and acceptance amongst young people a prominent issue.\r\n\r\nOur project group felt that by addressing this issue we could develop a complex project which will help not only the individuals involved in it but the whole school and wider community in which our schools exist.\r\n\r\nThe student participants will be selected in each school to reflect students from different backgrounds who have differing experiences of the issues mentioned or who belong to existing mentoring or support projects in their school.  It is intended to take 6 students and 2 staff members to each mobility.  This will be a different group of students each time to allow for maximum exposure to joint collaboration.  The overall number of students and teachers directly involved over the project lifetime is estimated to be at least 800.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve a range of activities in individual schools leading up to each mobility and then joint working groups taking part in a variety of collaborative activities during the mobilities.  Students involved in the project will stay in the homes of host students and experience cultural differences.  This is an extremely positive outcome which although non-tangible, in the past has proved beneficial with many still in touch adding to the projects sustainability.\r\n\r\nSpecific examples of activities envisaged:-\r\n\r\n-  Pupil voice activities and pupil teacher questionnaires\r\n-  Team building activities\r\n-  Peer counseling workshops\r\n-  Internet safety workshops\r\n-  Acting short plays to demonstrate discrimination\r\n-  Expressing feelings, opinions creatively through a variety of channels\r\n-  Collaborating in team building activities\r\n-\r\nThe teacher participants have great experience in working with mixed ability and mixed nationality groups to achieve maximum possible results.\r\n\r\nThe impact of our project will be significant both within the individual schools and into the wider community.  All participants will gain from the initial experience but the project will leave a sustainable legacy in that each participating school will have created a fully-functioning support network of students and teachers who will have the skills to identify cases of the issues covered and to constructively support victims so that they remain focused on their learning, feel included, supported and ultimately do not become disaffected and drop out of education.", "http://www.braunton.devon.sch.uk", "Braunton Academy", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036662_coordinator"], ["1PX", "Improving Coaching Techniques in Beach Volleyball through Beach Camps", "ACADEMY OF BEACH SPORTS", 39721.0, "The main scope of the project is the exchange of good practices in the field of beach volleyball (henceforth BV), through supporting the mobility of coaches, coordinators and staff of four international non-profit beach volley organisations located in the UK, Spain, Denmark and Hungary. The collaboration is planned to be realised in the context of international BV camp programs, trainings, seminars and coach courses in order to create synergies in the divergent practices of BV training in the participating European countries. The project would not only improve the methods of popularising the sport and the skills of coaching but would enhance participation and equal access for children not provided at the moment. The main target group of the project and its outcome is the youth (10-20 years old) age group.In BV, beach camps are the most important forums where practical and theoretical knowledge can be developed and interchanged. Throughout Europe, under different weather conditions and instrumental opportunities, these camps developed different strengths and weaknesses. The project\u2019s timeline and the structure of the meetings (eight in total) follow the important milestones of an optimal beach volley season organised in different venues of Europe in order to explore the divergent conditions and characteristics of camps. The objective is to map the training and preparation opportunities during the whole year on the continent, seeking continuity and sustainability through coach development and through building good relations among the partner countries. On the basis of the collected material, the partnership plans to jointly compile a detailed and illustrated handbook in which the practices of different countries are combined together presented also on a related video portal where the practices can be uploaded. The handbook and portal will include all the important thematic topics elaborated on the partner meetings and coach seminars and on the associated blog page.", "http://www.academyofbeachsports.org.uk", null, "erasmus_590753-EPP-1-2017-1-HU-SPO-SSCP_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1PX", "ACADEMY OF BEACH SPORTS", 8278.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_59387", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX33"}
