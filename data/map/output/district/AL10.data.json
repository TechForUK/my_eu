To address this pressing issue, PMinMCI will conduct the first systematic and innovative investigation of prospective memory in older adults at risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Prospective memory refers to remembering to do things in future (e.g., remembering to take medication or pay bills on time). Although it is a vitally important skill for one to function independently in everyday life, it has received so far little attention. The project will focus on: 1) identifying the prospective memory deficits that could serve as an early marker of cognitive decline and a predictor of dementia, 2) recognizing everyday memory problems of individuals in the transitional state between normal ageing and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and 3) proposing early psychological intervention aimed at reducing their anxiety and worry about memory. The expected results will allow practitioners to recognize opportunities for early intervention and help older adults in at-risk population maintain well being and independence in their everyday life as long as possible.

The benefits are large, however, as compilers need only capture concurrency in a virtual way rather than capturing, mapping and scheduling it. This separates the concerns of programming and concurrency engineering and opens the door for successful parallelising compilers. Mapping and scheduling is performed dynamically by implementations of the concurrency control instructions in the processors ISA. Another advantage of this approach is its binary compatibility. This means backward compatibility over a base ISA and forward compatibility as compiled code is executable on an arbitrary numbers of processors.

The HBP Flagship Initiative (HBP) thus proposes a unique strategy that uses ICT to integrate neuroscience data from around the world, to develop a unified multi-level understanding of the brain and diseases, and ultimately to emulate its computational capabilities. The goal is to catalyze a global collaborative effort. During the HBP\u2019s first Specific Grant Agreement (SGA1), the HBP Core Project will outline the basis for building and operating a tightly integrated Research Infrastructure, providing HBP researchers and the scientific Community with unique resources and capabilities. Partnering Projects will enable independent research groups to expand the capabilities of the HBP Platforms, in order to use them to address otherwise intractable problems in neuroscience, computing and medicine in the future.

Core fragmentation, pressure from the expanding ionised gas, magnetic fields and mass loss through stellar winds, all work against the effects of gravity, thereby restricting the final stellar mass. Advances in theoretical models, aided by numerical simulations (e.g. adaptive mesh refinement), have proposed elegant solutions; for example, the interaction between radiation and the dense circumstellar gas is subject to radiation-Rayleigh-Taylor instability, creating low opacity chimneys to vent out the radiation pressure. Likewise, heated cores and disks are stable against Jeans fragmentation. The exact manifestation of these issues and their solutions vary significantly between theories, and the physical structures found around embedded, still accreting massive stars provides a strong discriminator between models. Therefore, this research project aims to better understand the physical conditions of the gas and dust structures within the 500-5000 AU regions of infant high-mass stars by using adaptive-optics-assisted polarimetric observations in the infrared (essential to probe through the high extinction of high-mass cores).

Ostrobothnia and Vaasa commuting area is bilingual and multilingual. There are many international companies who has English as working language, specially in technology (energy). International competence and good language skills are tools for future success. \r\n\r\nDuring 2013-2015 Vaasa Vocational Institute started piloting ECVET principles in the international mobilities for students. At the same time the institute has tried to establish a continuing and mutual collaboration based on mutual trust and understanding with the partners in Europe. The aim has been to get all study programs at Vaasa Vocational Institute involved in the international activities. \r\n\r\nOVERALL GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE: \r\n\r\nThe project Establishing_ECVET@vao.fi is a mobility project for students and staff at Vaasa Vocational Institute. The project offers mobility to all study programs (EQF4) within the framework for  ECVET -principles. The focus lies on quality and security of mobilities and also on  indentification and recognition of knowledge and skills gained  during the whole mobility process from the beginning to the end with the help of portfolio combined with a electronic  blog.  \r\n\r\nThe focus lies even on the possibilities that the new national curricula for vocational education enables   and on identification and  recognition of informal learning and key competences for lifelong learning. A big emphasis lies also in participants commitment in planning the participants mobilities. \r\n\r\nThe participants are selected among second and third year students from initial vocational programmes (EQF4) within Vaasa Vocational Institute. Students within all disciplines are offered the possibility to participate.  Participants from staff will be head of departments, vocational teachers, study councellors and international co-ordinators. The amount of students is 74 and experts 15. \r\n\r\nThe partners abroad concists of organisations in Sweden, Estonia, Denmark, Norway, Germany, Great Britain, Spain and Slovenia (totally 15 partners). \r\n\r\nWHY  \r\n\r\nThe collaboration with the partners and the ECVET work at Vaasa Vocational Institute has now come to the point that there is a need to deepen, extend, establish and to develop the quality of the exchange. Also identification and recognition of knowledge and skills that the students acquire abroad has to been extended outside the vocational objectives. Vaasa Vocational Institute is developing models and tools for identification and recognition of knowledge and skills based on the  possibilities that the new national curriculum is enabling (starting in August 1th 2015). These models and tools will be piloted in this project. There is a need for established collaboration with the existing partners with focus on quality and security of the mobilities. There is also an interest in extending the cooperation to new study programs.  An intensive, mutual collaboration with focus on economical working methods and arrangements will gain both partners and students. \r\n\r\nTHE EXPECTED OUTCOMES  \r\n\r\nTo be able to offer qualitative and secure on-the-job placements abroad for students in all study programs within the principles of  ECVET framework. \r\n\r\nAn increased international knowledge, improved language skills and a increased possession of key competences for lifelong learning among the students \r\n\r\nA personnel who has ability and skills to coach the students in their process of gaining international skills. \r\n\r\nA model and tools for identification and recognition of knowledge that the student have obtained during the whole mobility process from the beginning to the end included informal learning. This model can also be established to other study areas, eg entrepreneurship. \r\n\r\nElimination of overlapping studies and evaluation which may enable shorter time of studies. \r\n\r\nA possibility to offer the students individual and flexible study paths which respond the students need and interest. \r\n\r\nTHE IMPACT OF RESULTS  \r\n\r\nThat  Vaasa Vocational Institute and vocational education is as a natural choice for potential students. \r\n\r\nThat students of Vaasa Vocational Institutes are attractive in the labour market and and are seen as a natural choice when employing new staff  \r\n\r\nThat the region of Vaasa has access to employees with strong international competence and good language skills \r\n\r\nThe relevant topics for the project are: quality assurance, recognition(non- formal and informal learning/credits), international cooperation, international relations and development cooperation.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008856_4"], ["9AF", "Partir et ouvrir son regard sur les autres avec Erasmus+", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 95831.0, "Since many years, \u00ab Maisons Familiales Rurales\u201d of Franche-Comt\u00e9 have been working on setting internships for our students and apprentices via the previous Leonardo program.\r\nIt seems obvious for us to work on the new Erasmus+ project entitled \u201cleave and open up your mind and look to the others\u201d.

As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_35"], ["9AF", "Mobilit\u00e0 transnazionale per il settore del TErmale e del BEnessere", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 278186.0, "CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT.  Italy is the European country with the largest number of spas thanks to its unique geology volcanic phenomena. In fact the spa and wellness tourism in Italy host  4.2% of tourists in hotels or other types of accommodation, that  means 15 million people every year. If we analyze the human capital skill in the sector, we understand that the demand for the professions, as  restaurant and bar service but also staff in marketing and fitness, increased. These companies need to be equipped by the staff with different level of skill and competences to be able to meet  the challenges presented by the market and to take advantage of  the opportunities to grow . The project TE.BE.  intends to respond to this need, by offering  an opportunity to the students and graduates of  Lazio, Tuscany, Lombardy, Puglia, Veneto and Piedmont  region to obtain an educational and professional experience in foreign companies that operate in the tourism sector of  spa and wellness in the following areas :- Tourist services: specific skill  in restaurant, bar, kitchen and technical services for accommodation;- Marketing and communication:  tourism marketing  and communication skill - Health and fitness:   spa and wellness skill;- Management and administration: management and administration skill .OBJECTIVES.  The participants involved will be able to carry out a training and professionalizing experience in international environments, which will enable them to equip themselves with a mix of interdisciplinary and interconnected skill. The project also intends to use the methods and tools for skill and credits recognition through the use of Unit of learning to be capitalized and converted into the school  and / or training credits  by measuring, recognizing, validating the LO through linear and transparent procedures according the indications  of the ECVET.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS80 STUDENTS. BACKGROUND. Young 16/19 years attending the 4th year of Secondary School from the regions that will participate in the project. 20 GRADUATES/NEW QUALIFIED. Young people who have obtained  a qualification or diploma within last 12 months  and is connected with the sector of tourism and wellness.The project  will also give the opportunity of participation to disadvantaged persons.ACTIVITIES. Project activities are following:- Project management (divided into 4 main documents, which contain 4 main  aspects of correct project management: Coordination and Control Plan, Plan for Learning and Evaluation, Plan of Management of the Communication,  Dissemination and Valorization)- Preparing for the internship (linguistic, technical, educational, cultural, digital preparation)- Identification and activation of interns (following the selection of participants, the MATCHING of the candidate-company will be held  in collaboration with foreign parties who will evaluate the profiles according to the availability of the enterprises)- Accompanying of the participants under 18 years and disadvantaged persons (mainly by professors of the institutes involved) adequately prepared.- Monitoring during and ex post- Final evaluation (outcomes, project, good practices)METHODOLOGY. The used methodologies are  practices to achieve effective, efficient and repeatable activity.RESULTS AND IMPACT. In general, the project will have the main impact in education and training (VET) sector thanks to: training results  of mobility participants; acquired skill (soft skill, professional skill, personal, cultural and ethical skill); recognition of training credits. The dissemination strategy will support the global objectives and specific project activities, in particular the publication of the project OUTPUT (materials, in particular the video made by the participants), but also the OUTCOMES (results) and OUTREACH (impact).LONG TERM BENEFITS. In the long term, we expect: greater involvement of Italian partners (institutional or non), the extension of the partnership abroad, from territorial and skill point of view; the possibility to carry out exchange projects and cooperation also thanks to the participation in other European programs (as COSME and other instruments that finance the social and wellness tourism etc.); the opportunity to become (as the Consortium) a prestigious partner in mobility management and the adoption of the logic EQAVET  nd of the system of recognition of the credits ECVET.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005267_8"], ["9AF", "F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika an der HLW/HF Lienz", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 57132.0, "The College for Tourism and Commerce and the Secondary School for Hotel and Catering Lienz aim at being a perfect starting point for the international job market. A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourism, competent language skills in English, Italian and French as well as a focus on services management and international communication is a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. Part of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks in the college and 24 weeks in the tourism school. In the past two years the interest of both the students and graduates of the two schools in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.With this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. Additionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and a number of young people (including students and  apprentices of the area) have contacted us with the wish to get more information about it. The news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.Currently 35 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.  Besides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. The experience of the last years has shown us that our trainees start their practical training abroad as teenages and finish it as young adults. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies. This naturally makes them become role models for many others.Due to this project an international way of thinking, working and evaluating has been established at the HLW / HF Lienz and has made it a more modern and  more attractive place of education.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-AT01-KA102-016396_7"], ["9AF", "TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2016", "Focus Hotels Management Ltd", 181977.0, "\"TirolerInnen auf der Walz 2016\" -  \u201eTyroleans on the Road 2016\u201cThe project objective is to promote the transfer of Tyrolean students in vocational education and Tyrolean apprentices to European companies, offering them possibilities to gain work experience and to improve language skills.

It will permit traineeship abroad mobilities for 381 students of Premi\u00e8re or Terminale (Year 12 or 13) over a period of 14, 28, 35 or 58 days, including 8 students with fewer opportunities and 1 partially-deaf student who will be integrated to a group of 4 other students.

The different mobilities will concern 11 European countries, over a period of 2 years. The mobility management committees of 2 schools with experience in VET traineeship abroad will be more precisely in charge of the students with fewer opportunities and will be able to assess new tools and adapted methods at the end of the project and share their knowledge with all the MELYPROLOR 5 partners. This tool sharing is already carried out via the collaborative platform open to all the members of the consortium. It has improved over the different group projects and from this year, it offers new tools such as a form with the names of companies ready to answer the requests of new schools (either in the same domain or in additional domains) or a European citizenship questionnaire taken before and after the mobility. The mobilities are envisaged in 31 domains, from the restaurant industry to the art embroidery including the stone trades or the maintenance of industrial equipments.Whatever their course, the students of the technology and vocational schools often form a weakened public, not very prone to move, which is particularly the case in Lorraine (as the figures show). Thanks to the European mobility, they will develop their professional skills in a different setting as well as their language skills. They will also acquire autonomy, self-confidence, capacity for adaptation to constraints and new working methods \u2013 some qualities that will make their insertion in the working world easier, be it in France, in one of the 3 border countries or elsewhere. Beyond the accompanying staff,  often indispensable at the beginning and/or at the end of the mobility (since the students are still minors), the opportunity to include training mobilities for the school staff in this project gives these people the possibility to integrate in the receiving companies, to develop a partnership over time, to assess everyone\u2019s expectations, to negociate the training contents at best, and for some of them to register for the certification in the teaching of a subject in a foreign language (CLIL lessons).The students who will benefit from the mobilities as part of the MELYPROLOR project will have demonstrated their motivation before the departure and will build their project before, during and after the mobility with the members of the management committee along with the families and the consortium steering group. The first expected concrete result will be the validation of the EuroMobiPro certificate which, along with the EUROPASS certificate, will be added to the students\u2019 diploma.

This year, we want to introduce a similar program for the students enrolled in the FCIL, recent graduates from various fields of vocational baccalaureate, complementary mention or higher education. They need a first professional experience abroad giving them a key asset on the labor market. A group of forty high schools allows to pool resources between member institutions and share a common vision oriented towards an international opening.The main objectives of the program are:- To provide participants with a first professional experience abroad. The trainee will develop valuable professional and personal skills combined with knowledge in a foreign language.- To allow students to learn and develop skills differently through informal learning structures, while continuing their studies and receiving feedback, but also benefit from the added value of the acquisition of diversified language skills.By setting out those objectives, we want to give these young recent graduates the opportunity to follow a six-month internship in Europe. Speaking another language will be an asset to enter professional life.Various activities will be proposed to participants in order for them to successfully achieve these goals. Previous to their departure, they will follow an International Training Program (FCIL) at Gustave Eiffel high school divided into two courses: online courses, seminars with intensive language courses.Participants will complete three training modules on everyday and professional life and learn about the culture of the host country. By developing new skills through this course, they will be able to live fully their six-month internship in a European country.At the end of the internship the trainee will defend a dissertation in front of a mixed panel of several members of the high school group.To conduct this project, a methodology has been developed to organize the mobility program by sharing responsibilities between associated high schools and the coordinating high school.The European mobility department coordinator meets every institution in order to inform target groups about the program. Each institution will then be in charge of informing, selecting and preparing their candidates.Students will begin the training program at the start of the new school year. If they have not found a host company, procedures will be set up to secure a work placement for each student. Internship missions will be defined by the tutor in agreement with the mobility representative of the related high school and the coordinator.The coordinator of the European mobility department, together with the mobility representative of the related high school are in charge of monitoring related work placements. The tutor is responsible for sending assessment forms on a regular basis.We will achieve good results by introducing an innovative learning program for young people. The program ensures an early preparation for students in an innovative work environment before the start of their internship. Once in Europe, by experiencing the concept of European citizenship, students will measure the importance of having a very good knowledge of one other EU language.The success of the program will also be measured by the development of their ambitions, their capacity to adapt and to be independent in the development of professional skills in order to integrate the market or to make the choice to carry on their studies.During meetings, we will discuss and present indicators and statistics in order to follow progress. Furthermore, official statements will be communicated on a regular basis.One of the major benefits of this collaboration is to enable institutions to join the program, especially those lacking resources to support such an initiative.

The center will organize the diffusion of the project, so much before to the mobility to announce the project to students and the whole educational community, as once finished the mobilities, to announce the results and to incorporate these to the methodology of the centre. The school will also select participants and assign the grants according to public criteria that will bear with their academic process, the attitude and motivation and the level of languages, rewarding better candidates.The intermediary partner in United Kingdom will collaborate with the school in the research of the companies better adapted in the destination country to host placements of each one of the participants, as well as with the training centre for teachers to fulfil their job-shadowing. They will carry out also an individual monitoring program at the mobility, so that students have always a person of reference in the country of destination to deal with any incident. This partner will be in direct and daily contact with hosting partners to know of the development of the placement of every participant, and to keep the school informed about it, as well as about any incident that could happen, being the first one to solve this situation.The mobility of students is foreseen for March, 2017, so that these four weeks of placement would be the first period of their compulsory FCT\u2019s. Once finished it, they will continue his their placement in the habitual way, back in Spain, and up to complete the total obligatory hours of FCT as the rest of students. Once finished their mobility, students will receive several supporting documents of  their experience such us Europass and Internship Certify, that they will be able to attach their CV to increase their possibilities of getting into to the labour market.At this moment begins in the school the diffusion period that includes: personal interviews with the participants to know by first hand their experiences in all the areas, informative meetings to students and all of the educational community with the intervention of participants, meetings at internal level with teachers who have realized the experience to make their colleges know their experience and develop a plan into which to incorporate everything acquired thanks to this experience into the modus operandi of the school.", "http://www.focushotels.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024049_1"], ["0JJ", "AEA: Awakening European Awareness", "CHILD UK", 12962.0, "AEA is a Youth Exchange that will take place in Catanzaro Province, south Italy and will involve 36 young people coming from Italy, UK, Greece, Lithuania, Spain and Turkey, aged 18-30. \r\nThe focus of the project is the European Union and its many aspects.\r\nThe specific objectives are:\r\n- Knowledge of the different European cultures;\r\n- Breakingof national stereotypes;\r\n- Knowledge of the role of the European institutions;\r\n- Knowledge of the European legal system;\r\n- Knowledge of the initiative of European citizens;\r\n- Knowledge of social, economic, cultural, variables related to problems in local and international contexts\r\n - Spread of knowledge of the history of the European Union and its institutions, from the birth to the present day (focus on Brexit and Turkey's sitation);\r\n- To value the importance of democracy and participatory democratic system;\r\n- Increase awareness of social and civil issues;\r\n- Inform about the tools that the EU has taken and is taking to promote its policies;\r\n- Initiate a reflection on the issues of the common good and active citizenship;\r\n- Strengthen the knowledge and skills of young people;\r\n- Acquisition of a greater awareness of their own cultural identity;\r\n- Promoting non-formal learning, especially the one of other languages;\r\n- Encourage the exchange of young Europeans ideas and expertise;\r\n- Promote social inclusion.\r\nThe activities will be carried out using the non-formal method, through the practice of \"learning by doing\".

To help us pool our practices we are now using a digital platform called W-alter (http://prac-mfr.univ-lyon1.fr/).Note, that for many of the young people the mobility will be an opportunity and may possibly be their only voyage in Europe.  Many of the young people do not have the opportunity to travel with their families as they have limited financial resources (about 50% are financially granted students).  About 80%  of the students are from rural areas, and remain strongly attached to their territories. The students are mostly first year Btech in different professional sectors: ( agricultural, management of wildlife and flora, landscaping, horticultural production, forestry, equestrian, services to people and territories.The activities envisaged are mainly centered on professional internships in different companies.  The professional contents will be established in close collaboration with the host companies, according to the various sectors.  The host companies of which 80% already colaborate with us and have done for some years, were selected according to their competences with  the same competences also found in French companies.  These learning acquisitions will help many of the young people have a broader outlook and help them to analyse their professional skills and practices in French companies.Cultural heritage visits will be conducted outside of internship time.  The achievements of non-formal learning, will be in a family setting, or in hostels.  Which will allow for the student to gain in autonomy, taking responsibility, and the remobilisation of language learning.  The participants can open up to other cultures and other realities, and to other customs.The project will have a number of different impacts on different levels: individual, in the sending establishment, also at a regional and even at a national level.  Evaluations will be provided in all the establishments to allow everyone to express themselves on their acquired experiences.  Often the evaluations are plubic in order to allow a greater number of people to be aware of the impact of such a project.  An ambitious plan has been up to communicate as widely as possible about the project, and also to promote the young people and their activities.  At this stage in the candidature for the year 2016 and 2017, 150 young people will take part in internships in different companies, 25 staff members of MFR in an accompanying framework, 2 staff members in internship and 20 graduates.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased

A profound theoretical and practical education and training in the field of tourismas well as a  competent language skills in English and Italian forms a comprehensive educational framework for this goal. \r\n\r\nPart of this work-oriented education are obligatory practical trainings of 12 weeks.  \r\nIn the past two years the interest of the students and graduates of the HLW Lienz in doing a practical training abroad has risen enormously. In order to facilitate all the work regarding practical trainings abroad for all people involved (students, parents, teachers, partner enterprises) two teachers got in charge of co-ordinating the entire Erasmus+ programme for the school and founded the  Verein der HLW / HF Lienz zur F\u00f6rderung von Auslandspraktika in the school year of 2015/16.\r\nWith this additional offer of training places abroad as well as the entire co-ordination of the Erasmus+ programme organised at the school, the internationalisation and the quality management of the two schools could be intensified and the positive reputation of the schools as a contact point for international work experience was established.  Due to the positive  feedback regarding the Erasmus+ programme by students and their parents as well as teachers of secondary schools we can also assume that the option of doing a practical training abroad has already become one of the main reasons why these students choose our schools their next educational step. \r\n\r\nAdditionally to the strong co-operation with the partner enterprises, based on mutual visits and a regular communication and contact throughout the whole year, the Erasmus + programme was promoted at the school and in the whole area with a vast amount of information about it. This included informational meetings as well as a buddy project with former trainees, information evenings for parents and students, permanent information boards introducing the Erasmus+ programme as well as all the parntner enterprises at the school, articles and blogs about the project on the homepage of the school, presentations about it at the parents' day and all secondary schools of East Tyrol etc..  Through this advertising of the programme as well as the personal networking of the trainees regarding this project other schools have already been inspired to consider practical trainings abroad for their students and the news about Erasmus+ programmes is spreading.\r\n\r\nCurrently 33 students are involved in this project. All of them have already signed their placement contracts as well as Learning Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding with the partner enterprises in England and Italy. All the training places have been chosen by the students themselves. They all got a positive reply for a practical training after their application including Europass CVs, motivation letters and personal job interviews. As all partner enterprises only have had positive experiences with trainees from our two schools, this co-operation has turned out to be a win-win situation for both: our schools profit from this additional international offer and the training places can rely on polite, helpful, dedicated and competent trainees for the most hectic period of work.\r\n  \r\nBesides an improvement in practical knowhow, intercultural knowledge and linguistic competences, which all lead to better resuls in the final exams as well as the A-levels, a practical training abroad is especially important for the positive development of all personal and social skills, especially an enhanced self-esteem of the trainees. This huge step in their personal development obviously also has a great impact on their further career at the school and in their later life.  Their career prospects do not only increase because of this international work experience but also due to their - often newly gained - openness, flexibiltiy and professional appearance which they get during an international internship. A large number of students who have done a practical training abroad plan a longer placement abroad after their final exams and they are much more confident and sure about their future plans when they start applying for jobs in international companies.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y.

The aim is to provide the growing Vaasa region with a competent labour force that will thrive in the international, multicultural and multilingual working life and society. The objective of the project Professional Skills through Mobilities@vamia.fi is to implement the priorities of Vamia\u2019s internationalization strategy.\r\nAll international mobilities are based on the ECVET system. The methods for identifying and recognizing skills achieved abroad will be further developed for all students.

In addition to this, all the practices regarding adult education students will be developed in order to create a high-quality process for international mobilities.\r\nThe project will enable all staff members and students to participate in international mobilities.The project will pilot and in the future intends to expand the mobilities of newly-graduated students.  The project will enable shorter mobilities for students with special needs.  Multilingualism will be promoted by developing Vamia\u2019s English-language export mechanical fitter education and training (starting in autumn 2017) as well as developing CLIL in all vocational education and training programs.\r\nIn the project new partnerships will be created. New partners will be given the opportunity to job shadow or do on-the-job learning in Vaasa. This will allow the staff and students of Vamia to get internationalized at home, make new contacts and together develop the quality of student mobilities.\r\nDuring this project we strive to further develop genuine and high-quality partnerships and networking while supporting Vamia\u2019s strategy and benefiting all stakeholders as well as contributing to quality assurance and safety of student mobilities. The aim is continuous improvement of the quality of international activities and mobilities by applying and developing LEAN tools such as continuous development boards, and by simplifying and standardizing practices. This applies to preparatory courses for students, on-the-job learning and assessment, the administration of international activities and the uniformity of practices across Vamia.  This also includes continuous training of the staff on the areas of responsibility and the phases of the international guidance plan as well as the continuous development of the students\u2019 use of the personal digital portfolio.\r\nThe aim is also to provide everyone with the opportunity to go abroad regardless of their study program, age, sex, and language or cultural background. The aim of the project is also to develop and increase the mobilities of adult students. Short mobilities for special needs students with an accompanying teacher (2 weeks in Glasgow), and a system for financially supporting students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds will be developed.

The students are mostly first year Btec in different professional sectors:  agricultural, management of wildlife and flora, landscaping, horticultural production, forestry, equestrian, services to people and territories and sales. In total, more than 261 students + 14 members of the staff will start an internship .\r\n-70 Mfr staff, mainly monitors( teachers of MFR)  and members of the board in an accompanying framework of the youth internship.\r\n\r\nNote that for many young people concerned, the mobility will be the only opportunity for them to travel in Europe.  Many have little opportunity to travel with their families, who have limited financial resources ( about 50% are financial granted students).  Moreover about 80% of the students are from rural areas, and remain strongly attached to their territories.\r\n\r\nThe planned activities are primarily focused on professional training in the enterprise. The professional content will be prepared in close collaboration with the host companies in each different professional sector.  The host companies are selected on their specific skills, often complementary to the skills found in French companies.  These learning acquisitions will help many young people to have a much broader overview and analysis on their professional skills and practices in French companies and these ones will be taken into account in the ECVET process.\r\n\r\nCultural heritage visits will be conducted outside of internship time.  The achievements of non-formal learning will be observed in a family setting, or in hostels. and will allow the student to gain in autonomy, taking responsibility, and the remobilisation of language learning.

Non formal learning outcomes will be developped on their different places of accomodation (for example alongside their host families). These situations will enable them to be more autonomous and responsible, and to get them more interested in learning languages. The participants will then be able to open up to different cultures, realities and customs\u2026\r\nIn order to run this project, we set up a consortium. Eighteen VET schools work together and share their practices. The Federation of Maisons Familiales Rurales of Bourgogne and Franche-Comt\u00e9, in partnership with the DAREIC, coordinate the project. Several coordination meetings are held all along the project. Different tasks have been established in order to enable the sending organisations (VET schools) to focus on the students who will carry out a work placement with Erasmus +.\r\n The project will have an impact on various levels : an individual impact on the sending organisations, but also at a regional and national level. A promotion of the project is planned in all VET schools in order to allow everyone to share their results and experiences. To promote the project, public events take place most of the time, leading the largest number of people to know more about the impact of this project. An ambitious dissemination plan has been set up to widely communicate on the project, and to value the young people, as well as their activities.\r\n Several meetings will be held regionally, such as awarding ceremonies that will have an impact at a regional level. The Regional Federation is part of a working group at a national level. It is currently working on other projects that are more strategic.

The City of Vaasa has also created an internationalization programme to support internationalization and to improve language skills. This project implement the priorities of Vamia\u2019s internationalization strategy.\r\nAll international mobilities are ECVET based where the personnel and all students are taken in concideration (also students with special needs) regardless examination, age, sex, language or cultural background.  Adult students have not had possibilities to take part in student mobilities before immersion of Vamia and therefore our aim is to add the mobilities among adult students. \r\nThrough the reform two \u201cInternational study modules\u201d will be specified to adapt the new system. \r\nThe students\u2019 personal digital portfolio will be further developed  and the students and staff will be more deeply familiarized with the utilization of it. \r\nVamia has been partner during 17-18 in a pilot project with student exchanges of 6 months financed by EU Commission. The aim is to solve challenges of long stay mobilities. In this project the aim is to continue with these long mobilities. The aim is also to expand the mobilities of newly-graduated students and offer them extra study modules by participating in student exchanges. \r\nIn Vamia\u2019s English-language export mechanical fitter education and in CLILL-teaching there is a need of improving English language skills. Therefore we are going arrange a long term English language course in Vaasa and after that continuing with an English language course in Glasgow (5 teachers). The school in Elgoibar has a similar programme in English and both schools will in collaboration develop material, create work placements and improving personnel\u00b4s knowledge.\r\nStudents in security programme (8) will be offered a Security programme course in a vocational school in Denmark. It has been difficult to arrange work placements abroad for security programme students because of the local legislation abroad.\r\nNew partnerships have been created through different projects which we now want to pilot. Some of the previous partners will no longer be in this project because changes of contact persons has made the collaboration less qualitative. The collaboration between partners is mutual and this give a good opportunity for personnel and students in Vamia to internationalize at home, build new contacts and to develop the quality of student exchanges together.\r\nNew partners will also  be given the opportunity to job shadow or do traineeship in Vaasa. There are eg mutual partners in Portugal (a new country), Denmark and Basque country. Collaboration with Germany will be further developed (a big demand in Technics). Developing LEAN work among management system, in learning environments and in improving the quality in collaboration with our partner in Holland. 12 experts (Lean co-ordinators, team leaders, student administration and technical support persons) will participate in jobshadowing in Tilburg (like the heads of Vamia did in January -18). They will develop further LEAN procedures in their own department. The collaboration is mutual. The participating personnel will get trained for Erasmus+ procedures, ECVET and travel security so they are more confident when they send teachers and students abroad. Also 3 representants from working life Villa Isolahti will participate in expert exchange together with Vamia\u00b4 s personnel to get to know elderly care and practical nurse education in Spain Gijon. Villa Isolahti reseive on yearly basis several Spanish exchange students. The rest of the exchanges in this project consists of job shadowing visits to school and local companies, to build contacts and to develop student exchanges.\r\nThere will be transferred 2 expert mobilities from year 2017 to autumn because of the wishes of host partner. All student mobilies for spring 2018 will may be not used in fully and if that\u00b4s the case there will be transferred approximately 20 student mobilities to early spring 2018. The mobilities are traditionally more active in spring time. Because of the reform the students graduate earlier and third year students don\u00b4t participate in exchanges so often like in previous years. There are also some partners who don\u00b4t want to reseive students who are minor aged which make it difficult to send second year students (for Bilbao it is not a problem and therefore we have them as a new partner).  Our aim is to arrange in the early autumn student exchanges for the third year students. The short exchange to Glasgow for students with special needs will be transferred to autumn. We are also going to advertice the possibility to get extra study modules after graduating by participating in student exchanges.
