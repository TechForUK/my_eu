NW Ltd", 224825.0, 5, 9, "Go Further Reach Higher is a VET mobility project aimed at targeting 90 trainees with fewer opportunities and 32 staff who work with them being sent by five diverse UK vocational institutions, a mixture of academies, colleges and training organisations. Trainees will undertake a two week traineeship in either animal management studies or wood occupations. Trainees and staff working in the field of Animal Management will spend their placement in either the Netherlands or Malta and their training will be based in a Donkey sanctuary, or a Cat Sanctuary with opportunities to undertake activities in an Ostrich Farm and/or a National Park.  For those staff and trainees who are undertaking studies or training in the field of wood occupation and carpentry, their placement may be in Sweden or Portugal in one of three fields, in carpentry, in restoration, or in joinery, three distinct areas giving participants a different experience and different learning opportunities. Placements will be tailored to the individual participants needs and may include activities in one or more of these areas. \r\n\r\nParticipants taking part in Go Further Reach Higher will be individuals from the UK based in VET institutions who have experienced social exclusion, come from poor socio-economic backgrounds, were early school leavers or have additional support needs. They will be accompanied on mobility experiences with professionals who will aid their travel, support their integration into the host environment and engage in both training and free-time activities with them. Staff from the six UK organisations who form this consortium will engage in complementary activities with the same four host partners in order to widen the benefits within the partner organisations and gain additional learning and new methodologies for individuals teaching in their chosen field. \r\n\r\nUK & overseas partners joined this consortium with a common goal to increase opportunities for European Co-operation, to offer opportunities to staff and learners within their home institution, to dedicate time to co-operating with European partners working in the same sector and to investigate the possibilities for transfer of qualification credits through ECVET. Over the two years of Go Further Reach Higher partners aim to set up strong partnerships which can be built on, adding new sectors to the fields of mobility. Through strong dissemination measures which have been developed by partner organisations over the last seven years involvement in previous EU funded programmes, to increase the visibility of the results of the project and through recognition and validation encourage participants to celebrate the successes they have made personally, socially and professionally and capitalise on these on return to their UK vocational training institutions.", "http://www.proconnw.co.uk", "Everythings Possible ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000342_2"]]}}}}
