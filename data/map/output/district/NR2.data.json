Going abroad allowed the participants to learn new techniques within their occupations in the host country and increased their language skills and intercultural competences. The funding opportunities of the EU Leonardo da Vinci programme, now Erasmus+, allowed the extension of the programmes and lead in 2008 to the establishment of the sequa mobility programmes SINDBAD and TRANSDUAL.

There will be a day of outdoor activities where the young people will work together and learn new skills and challenge themselves pushing their comfort zones to partake in new experiences.
