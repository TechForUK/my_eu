It is also essential that the students realize the benefits of gaining work experience abroad. They will be discovering and analysing a new culture through immersion and a quality support program and encountering local young people through European partners which will help them acquire intercultural experience and behaviour essential to their ultimate satisfaction.

After two successful projects (2013-2014 and 2015/2017), the program would like to lean away from expertise to focus more on exchanges and European mobility in order to portray an attractive and enriching experience while using an international approach in teaching and educational practices.
