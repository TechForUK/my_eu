This platform will bootstrap a commercially sustainable localisation process that allows SME Language Service Providers (LSPs) to continuously reuse the output of web content translation projects. By integrating these outputs with language resources from public bodies, SME LSPs can easily and cheaply optimise and tailor open source machine translation and automated terminology extraction components to the needs of their customers. Today, the curation of parallel text involves the publication of the undifferentiated results of translation projects in differing formats or via centralised repositories. This restricts SMEs in leveraging these resources to train machine translation engines to match incoming translation projects. FALCON will enable the controlled sharing and reuse of language resources, combining open corpora from public bodies with richly annotated output from commercial translation projects. Federated access control will enable sharing and reuse of commercial resources while respecting business partnerships, client relationships, competitive and licensing concerns.  Fine grained traceability language resource reuse will enable return on investment calculations on resource curation in public bodies and SME LSPs alike. The consortium combines academic expertise in localisation interoperability, linked data management, statistical machine translation and statistical parsing with SMEs offering services and solutions for translation and terminology management. This project will enable the language service industry to realise its potential as a major sources of shared linked data by measurably improving cost, speed and quality benefits of reuse. The consortium members will then be strongly placed to commercially exploit these benefits.", 208808.0, 1445043.0, "FALCON", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110505_994910086"], ["5JE", "BotsAndUS - First Assistant Robot For Retail And Hospitality", "Botsandus Ltd", "The retail and hospitality sectors have been facing an international increase both in terms of demand and sophistication. However, they are facing a series of issues. For instance, online is threatening retailers, traditional hotels and event attendance, which offer the advantage of convenience, advocacy and smart, real time insights/data. Also, customers have become immune to marketing across all channels. In this context, it is crucial for the companies from these sectors to offer memorable, fund and useful experiences, which is the key to encourage and multiply visits and sales. BotsAndUS intend to take advantage of this context by offering companies that rely on face to face customer interaction a state-of-the-art robot. It is capable to interact with people of various genders and ages, to autonomously approach and engage in conversation, as well as react to emotions, all to offer outstanding customer service. The market size for retail robots will reach 10 billion euros in 2025, the annual reduction in the cost of manufacturing robots able to interact with humans will drop by 26%, whereas there will be 3o times more interactions per day between humans and robots. BotsAndUs aim is to develop a consumer robot, able to autonomously approach and engage in conversation, react to emotions. Our company puts the user at the centre of Human-Robot-Interaction and develops an innovative technology by combining social sciences, human-centred design and cutting-edge engineering. Bo is the first robot that combines various technologies from the ICT sector to obtain a \u201csocial robot\u201d, which will be able to optimally interact with customers by engaging in conversations and adapt to various working environments and feedback from people. To ensure successful commercialization, in Phase 1 of SME Instrument, BotsAndUSintends to develop an elaborate feasibility study for Bo robot commercialisation.", 43972.0, 62817.0, "BotsAndUS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213678_910321333"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SL8"}
