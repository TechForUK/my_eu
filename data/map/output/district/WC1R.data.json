This project intends to operationalize a system, called the Oasis Loss Modelling Framework, that combines climate services with damage and loss information and provides a standardised risk assessment process that can assess potential losses, areas at most risk and quantify financial losses of modelled scenarios.

Secondly, it offers a higher return on investment since it is cheaper to install, operate and maintain, due to its low number of moving parts, the absence of a gearbox and the location of all serviceable components are at ground level, enabling the turbine to seamlessly reach its envisaged life-cycle; Thirdly, its wings can be used as a reflective screen, making it an attractive medium for advertising.\nThe Phase 1 project will be focused on establishing a complete supply chain, a sound business model and commercialization strategy, a planning of all activities for deploying a large scale pilot with 10 turbines installed in different locations, as well as the elaboration of an industrialization and marketing plan.", 36142.0, 51631.0, "URBAVENTO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_198845_927815768"], ["4JS", "An online software platform for effectively matching investors with start-ups, focused on boosting the cleantech sector", "Cagix Eu Limited", "CAGIX is a software company, with long-term experience in the start-ups, incubation and investment industry, which has developed an online incubation platform that covers investment preparation, incubator operations and portfolio company management.
