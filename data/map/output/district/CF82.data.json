Thus the four Social and Health Care Colleges working together in this project aim to create the foundation for the students' possiblity to obtain knowledge  about inernational conditions by providing possibillities for the students to go abroad for practice placements in the social and health care area and child care area. The main objectives of the project is to enhance the students' international competences through practice placements abroad thus encouraging the students to improve their skills in foreign languages and to improve, their vocational competences, their personal competences and occupational competences thus improving their qualifications to participate actively in the European labour market.\r\n\r\nThe project is focused on social and health care students and child care assistant students,  both level 4 in EQF. The practice placements will take place at relevant institutions.  The particpating Danish colleges have an increased number of students wanting to do a practice placement abroad, and we expect to send out 154 students during the project.The practice placements wil be provided by partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges which offer similar educations.

The job was funded for one year (1/11/10 - 1/11/11) by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome of the International Coordinator's role was to submit a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011 on behalf of the FE sector in Wales.  This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the first year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility - the focus on improving teaching and learning within the FE sector in Wales has proved to be the catalyst for submitting a consortium application for funding in 2014 under Erasmus+ for staff mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.

In this project for 2015-2017 we also work together about staff mobility (Annex 1).\r\n\r\nFirstly student and staff mobility is an important part of the colleges' initiatives to strengthen the international perspective in our educations and an important contribution to make our educations attractive to future students. Secondly student and staff mobility is vital in order to profile our colleges as competent partners concerning international projects both in Denmark and Europe. The main objectives of the project with regard to the students are to provide a basis for the students to obtain knowledge about international relations especially within the social and health care area and the child care area. Furthermore to strengthen the students' intercultural competences through practice placements abroad in order to strengthen their skills in foreign languages, personal and professional competences in order to improve their possibilities to become a part of the European labor market. With regard to the staff the main objectives are to strengthen the development of quality and innovation in both teaching and administration and to enhance internationalization at our colleges by sending out members of our staff for supplementary education abroad.\r\n\r\nThe project encompasses 102 social and health care students and child care students, 9 teachers and 1 administrative employee. The stays abroad will take place at relevant institutions. For the students the stays will last 1 month for members of staff the stays will last 1 week. The stays will be arranged in cooperation with our partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges that offer similar educations. These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Letter of Intent to fulfill the demands of the project.\r\n\r\nThe sending organization is responsible for preparing the participants pedagogicaly, linguistically and culturally, making sure that the insurances and health insurances comply with the demands of the Erasmus+ programme. Furthermore the sending institution is responsible for transferring the grant from the Erasmus+ programme to the participants' accounts. The receiving organization is responsible for finding suitable practice placements to the students, organizing a programme to the members of staff that will fulfill their objectives, finding suitable accommodation, making sure that there will be a mentor at the practice placement to guide the students, providing a tutor from college that will support the students in obtaining their objectives and be available if the students need help in unexpected situations. \r\n\r\nFor the individual student it is expected that the learning outcome for the practice placement will be achieved and that the student will graduate in due course.

With regard to the members of staff it is expected that they fulfill the objectives for their educational course and develop their intercultural competences in order to ensure a continuous positive development of the international perspective at our colleges contributing to fulfill the international strategies at our colleges.  As a result it is expected that the obtained knowledge and experiences will be reflected in a development of the teaching methods and administrative practices at our colleges. The participants (students and members of staff) are expected to share their knowledge and experiences with their colleagues and fellow students in order to contribute to the development of the international perspective of our colleges. If the management of our colleges consider it to be of relevance it is expected that the participants in meetings with our local and regional employers inform about their experiences in order to enhance the understanding of internationalization at our colleges and for the educations as such.\r\n\r\nIn a broader perspective it is expected that our participation in activities within the Erasmus+ programme will improve the participating colleges development of the international dimension in our educations.

An unsuccessful vocational orientation due to a lack of competence of the involved people is i.a. a reason for an increased number of training abortions. Because of that the risk of future youth unemployment and social exclusion for young people in Europe will grow. The basis for a high-quality vocational orientation, that gains in importance because of the increasing cross-border education and training market mobility for both potential trainees, as well as the companies, is an EU-wide, on quality standards basing qualification of the vocational orientation measures implementing staff (e.g. teachers, professionals of youth work , trainers, career counselors). The need to develop a specific European qualification for voactiona orientation results from the following reasons: 1. In addition to numerous different measures with cooperating companies, an inadequate integration of vocational orientation e.g. in the school education and various consulting offers of different institutions, the implementation methods and priorities of vocational orientation in the EU are very versatile, non-transparent and non-uniform. That is attributable to a different degree of implementation of the vocational orientation in Europe and a different qualifications of the specialist staff. 2. Especially the industrial, technical and handicrafts fields with its diverse training opportunities offers young people with a low/middle school leaving certificate and disadvantaged young people numerous job opportunities.  3. The specialised staff (i.a. in schools, institutions of independent youth work, education providers, chambers, consulting intuitions, job agencies) has often only informally acquired professional / methodological knowledge and there is also often a lack regarding to the knowledge of the specific requirements of the workplace and the special job requirements. 4. Companies complain an inadequate professional monitoring and counseling for young people in the process of career choice, because the requirements of the working world are not known.The development of the above-mentioned EU qualification concept and the supplementary VET products contributes on one hand to a professionalization of the actors, who are doing vocational orientation measures/guidance. On the other hand young people will be accompanied and advised in a better quality in their process of career choice, with the result that the next generation of skilled worker is sustainable ensured for companies. To make the EU-concept transferable in all countries and regionsand  cross-border comparable, we also develop quality standards for the concept to ensure the quality. Furthermore, a good practice guideline for the implementation of vocational orientation measures/activities will be developed that supports the practical implementation through the preparation of unknown measures/ activities/models/teaching materials for the actors and making them accessible. In addition, an assessment instrument will be developed that allows companies to identify whether potential trainees are suitable for the selected training program/profession and if they have gone through a good vocational orientation. So for companies should be ensured that the trainees don\u2019t cancel the training due to lack of professional ideas and aptitute. Furthermore against the background of a sustainable implementation of the products should be developed a guideline for implementing  in the EU-level as well as a webplattform to download all the products and further information that support the work of the actors. Against the background of the project aim of the sustainable implementation of the developed products in the EU should be also developed guideline for implementation (i.a. to integrate all in the education of teachers) as well as a website to download all the products and of further information to support the work of the actors.The development of the different products is based on a VET scientific analysis (actual/ target analysis, case studies, expert interviews) in all participating countries on the current status of vocational orientation, the level of implementation in schools, universities and career consulting firms, training companies (initiatives, measures, programs, curricula, etc.) and the requirements of all stakeholders to a vocational orientation.With the support of the developed Products should be initiated a professional future orientation support process, which enables young people to establish their own career choice competence. The vocational orientation measures support young people in their career choice process so that they are able on the basis of their knowledge to meet the right career choice.", "http://www.cymoedd.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA202-003251_4"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7PG", "The Lawns", "Caerphilly County Borough Council", "The establishment of two new buildings on the Lawns Industrial Estate in Rhymney. 10 new units will be built on the site where there is already 21 fully occupied industrial units", "ERDF", 1291667.0, 2030811.0, "erdf_wales_81378"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF82"}
