If the control electronics were to be migrated to the engine core environment, it would be subjected to steady-state temperatures in the order of 2500C, rising to 3000C during transient engine behaviour. In this environment, today\u2019s electronic control units would exhibit inferior performance, reduced reliability and extremely short lifetimes.\n\nThe prime aim of the HiTME project is therefore to develop a safety-critical electronic system which can operate reliability when installed in the severe engine core environment. Central to this objective, will be the development, to TRL6, of electronic components and material technologies along with smart thermal and packaging designs that make the concept feasible.\n\nIn order to design a product capable of withstanding the high temperatures associated with an engine core installation, whilst still maintaining performance (accuracy) and life, fundamental advancement in key technological areas will be necessary.

Because eradication requires treatment with multidrug regimens, there exists a very strong need for a vaccine to prevent initial infection.\n\nImmunization with H pylori protein subunits in humans has shown adjuvant-related adverse effects and only moderate effectiveness. However, with much greater knowledge of the molecular basis of infection and having learnt lessons from previous vaccine developments, the current consortium have drawn together three strand that are considered critical to the development of an effective vaccine:\n-\tPowerful, safe and multivalent antigens\n-\tPowerful, safe and multi-acting adjuvants\n-\tPowerful, modular and flexible oral vaccine delivery system\n\nAll three of the above innovative technologies have been proven to be effective in doing what they are required to do, namely:\n\n-\tAntigens \u2013 produce antibodies against a number of key H pylori bacterial components\n-\tAdjuvants \u2013 stimulate the immune cells to produce significant numbers of long lasting antibodies\n-\tDelivery \u2013 formulate antigens and adjuvants together and target the stomach and intestine\n\nThis consortium (HELICOVAXOR) uniquely converges all three into a true vaccine with real potential to protect from H pylori infection. The vaccine is being designed for oral administration, efficacy, safety and temperature stability.\n\nThis consortium has assembled leading academic, industrial and regulatory groups, the activities of which will be coordinated to perform analysis of the formulations, efficacy and safety testing of the vaccines and the preparation of a regulatory dossier, all required before the product can enter human clinical studies.\n\nIf successful in pre-clinical studies, the consortium will work with vaccine companies to progress human studies and launch the product as a vaccine to confer protection from H pylori infection.", null, 1493099.0, "HELICOVAXOR", "Towards an oral vaccine for Helicobacter pylori", "A European consortium is developing a novel, orally delivered vaccine against Helicobacter pylori. Using encapsulating technology the vaccine will be administered orally, thereby directly reaching the site of H. pylori infection.", "According to the World Health Organisation, the incidence of H. pylori infection exceeds 50 % in developed countries and 80 % in developing countries. It is spread through casual contact and can persist for life, inducing active and chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Although most infections respond to antibiotics, some patients develop resistance and are at higher risk of disease.\n\nTo address this medical issue, the EU-funded 'Development of an oral Helicobacter pylori vaccine' (http://www.helicovaxor.com/ (HELICOVAXOR)) project proposes to develop an oral H. pylori vaccine. This vaccine should be effective at both preventing and treating H. pylori infection.\n\nPrior immunisation attempts with H. pylori protein subunits in humans have shown adjuvant-related adverse effects and only moderate effectiveness. Having learnt from these, the current consortium is combining multivalent antigens and multiple adjuvants for increased efficacy. Two H. pylori antigens (i.e., HpaA and urease) have demonstrated stronger protection compared to immunisation even with lysed H. pylori bacteria.\n\nDelivery of the vaccine is based on the SmPill\u00ae integrative oral drug delivery technology. This system encapsulates the drug to be delivered using an advanced nano-emulsion/micelle format that is stable at ambient temperature and ensures controlled release.\n\nFollowing the vaccine prototype completion, the long-term plan of the project is to scale up production and prepare the vaccine for clinical trial. Given the high worldwide prevalence of H. pylori infections and their strong association with gastric cancer development, efforts towards a therapeutic vaccine are long overdue.", "http://www.helicovaxor.com/", "http://www.diamondpharmaservices.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/146968.jpg", "fp7_106836_953524163"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CM19"}
