Without immediate enhancement of capacity and capability in this specific area of biodiversity science, the native seed industry in Europe will fail to develop towards the multi-million dollar markets of the US and Australia. NASSTEC plans to interconnect the public and private sector through the establishment of a multidisciplinary European doctoral \u2018school\u2019 with the aim of integrating knowledge in plant ecology, genetics, molecular biology, taxonomy, ecology, conservation, seed biology, environmental science, agricultural botany, crop science, breeding and horticulture. This knowledge will be transferred to industry, thereby contributing to the EU bio-economy. NASSTEC includes 7 full (FP) and 7 associated partners (AP) from 4 EU Member States. It interconnects 4 different sectors: private companies (3 FP and 2 AP), NGOs (2 AP), public land governance bodies and academic institutions (4 FP and 3 AP). The scientific and training programmes embrace 12 research topics, clustered under three sub programmes: A) In situ seed sampling; B) Seed biology characterisation; and C) Production and deployment of seed. Critically, the findings from the three sub-programmes will be interconnected, integrated and communicated rapidly and effectively to the ESRs/ER and all external stakeholders through a global e-Learning Environment (ELE). This ELE will be pivotal in delivering a balanced scheme of exchange visits and secondments, a rich programme of network events, news of network achievements and research information; including the findings of the final NASSTEC conference. NASSTEC will increase the competitiveness of ESRs/ER substantially and ensure that human capital is directed towards the development of a sustainable and dynamic European native seed industry.'", 399089.0, 2725966.0, "NASSTEC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_109248_998251251"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6JJ", "Language Training", "Maisondieu Primary School", 4720.0, "Maisondieu Primary School intends to include the delivery of  the national 1+2 Languages initiative in all 14 classes next session.  The school would like to raise attainment in languages amongst pupils, as well as increase staff confidence in their provision of modern languages in the primary school.  It is important that senior pupils have more confidence in their languages ability when making the transition to secondary education.  The three participants in this course will then deliver languages training at Early, First and Second level throughout the school to the other 11 teaching staff.\r\n\r\nThe school strives to be a forward-thinking place of learning, and needs teaching staff who are confident in their French abilities to deliver quality training to other members of staff.  This project offers an unprecedented opportunity for staff to share and gain learning and teaching resources which make languages learning enjoyable and achievable for pupils.\r\n\r\nThe three participants all have some previous training in the delivery of modern languages in the primary school.  All have identified languages provision as a personal target in their own action plans.  The three experienced teaching staff are all full time, and have had experience of teaching at Early, First and Second level.  This training in language and methodology will help staff embed the target language of French into the daily curriculum at Maisondieu.\r\n\r\nThe immersion course in Salignac will provide participants with the opportunity to further their knowledge and understanding of the French language, including grammatical consistency.  Learning about the use of songs when teaching French will greatly benefit staff when delivering lessons to younger pupils.  Gaining a further understanding of modern French culture and the French education system will allow participants to embed these elements into their daily learning and teaching, enabling pupils to be successful learners and global citizens.  The opportunity to share resources and ideas with other participants is invaluable, and is an essential element of professional development.\r\n\r\nThe participants will gain further methodology regarding the successful learning and teaching of modern languages with children.  The staff are keen to engage with the idea of global citizenship whilst on the course.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the impact of this project will be that all staff at Maisondieu acquire new skills essential for the successful teaching of modern languages in the primary setting.  Participants will gain further cultural awareness which in turn can be shared with other staff and pupils.  The 1+2 Languages programme will be embedded into the daily life of the school, including the teaching of the French language everyday.  The school will raise the importance of learning a modern language within the community, with meaningful links being made to the world of work and skills for learning, life and work.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits of this project are that the learning and teaching of modern languages will be embedded into the curriculum, with natural progression through year groups evident.  Confidence in the teaching of languages will be high amongst all teaching staff in the school, and pupils will positively engage in modern languages learning.  Effective languages learning will also result in greater confidence amongst pupils, as well as higher levels of attainment.", "http://www.maisondieu.angus.sch.uk", "Maisondieu Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013243_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DD9"}
