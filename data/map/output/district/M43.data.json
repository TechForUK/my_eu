This has resulted in a mutually beneficial project which aims to improve and develop teaching in both settings. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to develop teachers understanding of the customs and culture in our partner school in order to enhance our delivery of Spanish as a Modern Foreign Language. The involvement of our MFL coordinator in conjunction with our International Coordinator and a Strategic International Group will ensure a long term impact on the curriculum. \r\n\r\nWe also hope to observe the creative use of performing arts to enhance the curriculum in order to inspire pupils. These methods will be analysed to see if they would have an impact on the curriculum delivery at Moorside.\r\n\r\nIn return, our Spanish partners hope to observe how we at Moorside use ICT to enhance and support the curriculum. They are also interested in the way we gain pupil attention and generate calm learning environments. This will enable our participants to develop their coaching skills by sharing methods with their Spanish colleagues. \r\n\r\nWe intend to involve 8 members of staff in traveling to our partner school. However, presuming our partner school are also successful, many more staff will become involved in the project as a whole due to Moorside hosting Spanish staff and working alongside them. The participants involved in traveling to Gloria Fuertes will be staff who have already shown an interest in developing our European profile by filling in application forms and describing the impact they feel their visit will have. \r\nThe main activity will involve job shadowing, as well as participation in lessons towards the latter end of the visit. The role of the teacher visiting will be decided by the host school, in conjunction with Moorside's International Coordinator.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above activities, we expect our Spanish curriculum to become inspiring and engaging. We will also ensure that our Spanish curriculum includes reference to customs and cultures. This will have long term impact on the MFL curriculum at Moorside.", "http://www.moorside.tameside.sch.uk", "Moorside Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000122_coordinator"], ["6AF", "Embrassant Fran\u00e7ais en Masse/ Embracing French on Mass", "Fairfield Road Primary School", 7444.0, "This project relates to a larger than average primary school in the North West of England. Through discussions with the Senior Leadership Team and the elected members of staff, it has been decided that the aim of the project is to ensure that languages is core within the school curriculum and children's learning. \r\nThe Languages coordinator has highlighted that the following need to be given priority:\r\n*To provide staff development in delivering and teaching the curriculum, including both language and culture\r\n*To support staff and increase staff confidence in the teaching of French\r\n*To support staff in planning for progression  \r\n*To develop school links with a partner school in France\r\n*To develop a cross curricular approach to the teaching of French \r\n*To facilitate these outcomes and to ensure a strong lead by the Modern Foreign Languages coordinator, elected candidates should have the opportunity to make links with a French school and increase their own knowledge of language and culture, in order to support staff in school from September 2014.  \r\nThe four candidates will then be able to lead, support and assess staff development in both Early Years, Key Stage One and Key Stage Two. \r\nThe impact envisaged will be:  \r\n*The changes in Modern Foreign Languages are led strongly within school by four confident, knowledgeable members of staff\r\n*Support via Team Teaching, staff meetings and development days in addition to support with time tabling and cross-curricular links will happen to facilitate staff development during the academic year 2014-15 \r\n*Staff subject knowledge and confidence will increase\r\n*The curriculum becomes embedded throughout school\r\n*Children's learning and progression is apparent through regular assessment\r\n*Real and purposeful links with partner schools further supports the Modern Foreign Languages curriculum  \r\n\r\nThis will provide an excellent opportunity to ensure French becomes an integral part of Fairfield Road's curriculum; and will give the elected members of staff invaluable knowledge and confidence to drive forward a substantial and meaty project within school, which has been given high priority.", "http://www.fairfieldroad.tameside.sch.uk", "Fairfield Road Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002139_coordinator"], ["7DA", "Moderne Leistungsfeststellung und Leistungsbewertung im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich", "Moorside Primary School", 7606.0, "Background of our new project \u201eModerne Leistungsfeststellung und Leistungsbewertung im europ\u00e4ischen Vergleich\u201c  is the implementation of the new Bavarian curriculum (Lehrplan Plus) at our school in the school year 2014-15 and hence the possibility to break new ground within the framework of school development. Furthermore we want to integrate the cooperation with European partner organizations as a permanent part into our school concept and to push forward the internationalization process of our institution.\r\nOur aim is to establish in our everyday school life alternative forms of judging pupils\u00b4 performances as well as discussions about the progress of each child. This year we had such kind of discussions for the first time, whereas other European countries are already used to that. The two selected partner schools in Great Britain and South Tyrol already possess a profound knowledge in this field. During a job shadowing we want to benefit of their experience and gain a profound insight into judging pupils\u00b4 performances and discussions about learning progress, which we later can use to improve our own system. In order to be able to communicate competently and purposefully during the job shadowing visit and also with future European partners, the visit of language courses is intended. \r\nTo strengthen and not to overstrain the capacities of the involved organizations we confine ourselves to 5 mobilities and 4 participants (headmistress and 3 colleagues). The colleague taking part in job shadowing like the headmistress, is on the one hand the coordinator of our current Comenius- and the planned Erasmus+ activities. On the other hand she is representative of the new curriculum and spokeswoman of the 1st/2nd class teachers and therefore actively involved in our school development work. The two other participants were selected due to their high motivation and willingness to transfer their gained experience to the staff.\r\nWhile job shadowing in South Tyrol the headmistress will get an overview on school management level about the local school development policy and modern ways of judging pupils\u00b4 performances as well as the organization and realization of meetings with children and their parents to discuss about each child\u00b4s progress. The colleague job shadowing in Great Britain will study the same aspects from a teacher\u00b4s point of view. In order to be able to communicate competently with the English colleagues and to follow the lessons and the conversations with children and parents effortlessly, she will attend a special language course for teachers in advance.\r\nAs a follow up of the two job shadowing visits the staff of our school will be informed in detail about the new experiences and will be actively integrated into the school development process. Together we want to develop and to put into practice alternative forms       of observing pupils and their performance and establish regular meetings with children and their parents to discuss about each child\u00b4s individual progress. On the occasion of a professional exchange with colleagues of other schools in the framework of network meetings of the curriculum representatives, the colleagues of schools in our neighbourhood will also benefit from our experiences abroad and the resulting practice of observing pupils and their performance and of meeting with children and parents to discuss about individual progress. \r\nThe two other colleagues will attend language courses in Great Britain and then transfer their knowledge to the staff within a teacher training. One teacher will focus on the communication with European partners and thus motivate our colleagues to take part in our Comenius- and Erasmus+ activities. The other teacher will emphasize the methodology of teaching English to young learners and thus enhance the professionalization of the English teachers and their lessons at our school. This should contribute to motivate the pupils and to enable them to communicate in English with children at our European partner schools. \r\nThese are our aspired results and effects and the long-term benefits of the present project:\r\nOur school development plan should be affected positively in a sustainable manner. For this purpose we want to establish, on the basis of the knowledge gained abroad, modern forms of observing pupils and their performance and conduct regular meetings with the children and their parents to discuss about pupils\u00b4 progress, basing strongly on the children and including individual learning and development targets. Beside the teachers especially the children and their parents should therefore profit from the project. The increased language skills of the involved teachers will have long-term effects on the professionalization of the English lessons at our school and the further communication with future Erasmus+ partners. Thus the present project is also very useful for our European development plan.", "http://www.moorside.tameside.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA101-013389_1"], ["7RA", "Raising Aspiration through the Spanish language", "Greenside Primary School", 27861.0, "Our school is located in a deprived area of Manchester. We want to offer the best possible opportunities to our pupils to raise their attainment. To help achieve this, we want to take a whole school approach towards embedding the Spanish language. We plan to; - Increase language knowledge and confidence,- Improve intercultural understanding,- Develop our understanding of effective teaching methods and strategies relevant to different age groups of pupils,- Gain knowledge of the most effective and appropriate resources for the different ages,- Experience life in a Spanish school, assimilating new teaching techniques and ideas, reflecting on our own pedagogy and discover new and innovative approaches to learning,- Improve management competencies of our MFL coordinators,- Find ways to integrate Spanish into all aspects of our school life, and increase internationalisation and the European dimension across different subject areas.Our plan is to develop a project which will see 16 members of staff from different year groups and with different roles in the school to take part in structured courses in Santander, Spain. These 16 participants will take on a leading role within the school, supporting other colleagues and disseminating skills and knowledge.The selected courses are intensive, 8 day courses that will immerse the participants in the language and culture of Spain. They include 15 hours of intensive language tuition with participants grouped according to their current level, methodology sessions delivered by ex-local authority consultants There will be the opportunity to spend two days in a Spanish primary school. There will be timetabled sessions as part of the course where we will have the opportunity to discuss our project with colleagues from other institutions and share ideas with them. We will continue to build on the work we are currently doing to improve the teaching and learning of languages and intercultural understanding in our school, e.g. through language courses and self-study and will develop further opportunities for peer support as part of the project.Project results will be incorporated into the management framework of the school and form part of our school development plan.Tangible outputs will include;- production of new teaching materials, - development of a training and support package, - review of management roles of the MFL coordinators,- changes in the timetabling of language lessons and an increase in cross curricular work, - whole school staff meetings to feedback to colleagues and discuss ways in which new methodologies, ideas and resources can be integrated into teaching practice,- monitoring of language teaching by the two MFL coordinators, - language, culture and methodology training by participants, - new lesson planning and observation formats which will be used consistently throughout the school,- many more staff (both teaching and support staff) involved in the teaching and learning of Spanish, - Spanish taught in more year groups including early years,- a strategy for linking language learning to literacy,- development of clubs and out-of-school activities.We expect these long term outcomes; \u2022 Improved language competence.\u2022 Better understanding of language teaching methodology.\u2022 improved intercultural understanding.\u2022 improvement in participants\u2019 confidence. \u2022 Increased motivation and enthusiasm for teaching. \u2022 improved planning and management skills.Learning outcomes for our pupils will include;- improvement in their language competence resulting from an improvement in teaching,- wider opportunities for language learning through clubs etc. and - the opportunity to regularly communicate and work jointly with Spanish pupils encouraging  improved language learning experience, more enthusiasm for the subject and a better understanding of how languages can benefit them in their future lives and careers.There will also be long term outcomes for our link school in Spain, other schools within our cluster ,and our parents.", "http://www.greenside.tameside.sch.uk", "Greenside Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023304_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M43"}
