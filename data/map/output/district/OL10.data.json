St. Luke's is situated in a deprived area. The community has limited cultural awareness due to the area being predominately \u2018White British\u2019. There are 300 pupils in the school aged 4-11 and we have 56 staff.\r\n\r\nFrench is currently taught by one teacher in school and this has limited impact on the school community; it is taught as a stand-alone subject and we want to embed this into the school ethos and environment. This project will focus on the following areas of improvement:\r\n\r\n1) The profile of languages in school will be enhanced.\r\n2) Staff at St Luke\u2019s have not previously taught French therefore we want to up skill and develop the confidence of all staff when delivering French. This will ensure children can make good levels of progress.\r\n3) Subject Leadership: The school has recently appointed two outstanding teachers to be our French Co-ordinators. Both are new to the role and will require support to develop their own subject knowledge and lead their colleagues.\r\n4) Cultural awareness and the European Dimension:\r\nOur staff and pupils lack personal experience of France and its customs. We need to develop their understanding by providing meaningful learning which gets to the heart of what it means to be French. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives this Erasmus+ Key Action1 staff mobility project will provide the opportunity for 8 Teachers and Teaching Assistants to attend intensive residential courses, based in Carcassonne, in the south of France. \r\n\r\nWhilst in France, they will take part in quality training activities and visit a French primary school. This will develop their cultural understanding and personal language skills; it will motivate and make French meaningful for the whole school community.   \r\n\r\nThese mobilities will:\r\n\r\n\u2022  improve participants\u2019 language proficiency and develop their confidence in using French\r\n\u2022  give participants first-hand experiences of the culture through a range of activities and by immersing them in local life. This will impact positively on their intercultural awareness and increase their subject knowledge\r\n\u2022  provide participants with a bank of effective and engaging ideas to encourage active learning and facilitate excellence in the primary languages classroom \r\n\u2022  encourage the use of ICT and new digital technologies in language teaching \r\n\u2022  familiarise them with key documents and resources enabling them to become more effective language teachers \r\n\u2022  encourage links between British and French teachers with a view to developing lasting partnerships and future projects.\r\n\r\nThe envisaged impact of the project will not only be on the 8 participants who take part in the French immersion courses, but on the whole school community; there will be lasting benefits to the school.  Staff will have increased confidence delivering French, pupils will be inspired and motivated by dynamic teaching and will have a greater culture awareness.  \r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits will be enhanced employability for staff as they will have received unique language training not available in the UK.  Pupils\u2019 life chances will be increased, as living in a deprived area with limited cultural experiences they will be given the opportunity to see beyond the community in which they live. Finally, the school environment will develop a more \u201cEuropean\u201d feel, as we will embrace the opportunity and visitors to school will see the impact through displays and signs around school.", "http://www.stlukesceprimary.co.uk", "St Luke's CE Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035739_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "OL10"}
