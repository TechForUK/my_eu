The Head teacher is a shared Head with another very small rural primary school in the next valley. In Forest of Teesdale there are 16 Pupils and in Rookhope, there are 19 pupils.  The staff comprises of 2 full time teachers and 5 part time across both schools. The locality is extremely isolated due to geography and as a result, the pupils are 100% white British and none of them have EAL. Most families are hill farmers, rearing sheep for breeding purposes.Forest of Teesdale Primary School is a mono-culture and one of our key priorities is to broaden the children's knowledge and understanding of other countries and cultures in Europe and beyond.French has been taught as an MFL in Forest of Teesdale since 2010 but the expertise of staff is currently extremely varied and mixed. This presently has a limiting effect upon the levels of mastery which the children can be expected to achieve.As we are all aware, MFL is now a compulsory part of the 2014 National Curriculum. The expectations is that children will make year on year improvement in their language skills proficiency. Although there has been a compulsory requirement for the last two years there has been limited provision of training for current teaching staff already in post to to develop their teaching skills in this area.It is with this status quo that I have been searching for quality CPD.Our project objectives are as follows:-- To develop participants knowledge of and Proficiency in French language, culture, tradition and heritage this will lead to them delivering cpd to all other staff in the school.-To train participants to become more proficient in the teaching and learning of French in the primary School. -To increase the pupil's understanding and knowledge of  French culture, traditions and heritage.-To enable pupils to make year on year progress in their attainment in French. To reach secondary ready levels and mastery in this subject area.-To maintain and develop an effective link with our French partner school to enable us to to undertake a range of language learning activities.The project will involve sending 3 staff on an 7 day course in France to undertake an intensive language and methodology course in year 1 of the project and sending those staff to job shadow in our partner French primary school in year 2. There is a clear selection process which has been outlined earlier in this application. These staff will then be expected to cascade their knowledge which has been gained to the rest of the school staff on their return.This visit to France will involve an intensive personalised tuition in the French language and culture including an opportunity to teach in a French school. The methodology will be suited to delivering teaching and learning to primary aged pupils.The project will impact upon the participants and also upon colleagues and the attainment of the pupils in Forest of Teesdale Primary school. Participants will also share information and resources with other schools in the Local Authority.The project will support us in sustaining our partnership with our linked French Primary School. During the second year of the project Job shadowing will take place with this school.Following the project the pupils will attain secondary ready levels and gain mastery of the French language.", "http://www.forest-of-teesdale.durham.sch.uk", "Forest of Teesdale Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023917_coordinator"]]}}}}
