EMIF aims to address this by developing a common Information Framework that enables improved access to these data sources, enhancement through linkage of the different sources and collection of additional new information. EMIF will focus on two specific research objectives in order to guide the development of the Information Framework:  identification and evaluation of biomarkers i) of the risk for metabolic complications in obesity; ii) of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease onset in the preclinical and prodromal phase, which in both cases will identify high-risk individuals for future intervention trials. To achieve this, a variety of data sources ranging from small-scale information-rich disease cohorts for biomarker discovery to large EHR data for population characterisation and biomarker validation will be utilised. An extreme phenotype approach will utilise the subpopulations at the extremes of a particular trait distribution using large-scale metabolomics and proteomics for biomarker evaluation. The development of the Information Framework will involve addressing data standards, semantic interoperability as well as ethics, data privacy, legal issues and the development of an IT platform for multi data sources access. The Information Framework will be designed to support the current research objectives, but more generally studies using human health data.

However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account.

Accurate structure and compositions of NuRD and PRC1/2 complexes were obtained along with potentially useful novel interacting molecules using ChIP-seq in mouse ESCs (mESCs). A flexible, sensitive and high-throughput genetic screening technique was developed for testing cell lines using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library.

Understanding the genetic background of individual cancer cases and the presence of certain 'biomarkers' can determine the outcome of drug treatment.\n\nThis is exemplified by colorectal cancer (CRC) where a subset of cases responds to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody therapies, based on the presence or absence of certain mutated alleles. In light of this, the EU-funded 'Modelling and predicting sensitivity to targeted therapies in colorectal cancers' (Coltheres) initiative aims to understand what defines the sensitivity and resistance to agents targeting the EGFR signalling pathway in CRC.\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that activating K-ras (KRAS) mutations are the cause of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in 30\u201340\u00a0% of patients but other molecular alterations can cause resistance as well. The Coltheres team is investigating these alterations and the associated gene expression signatures that can be used to identify more accurately which cancers will respond to EGFR inhibition.\n\nAssociation of KRAS mutations with acquired resistance to targeted therapies for CRC is also observed with B-raf (BRAF) mutations. Inhibition of the BRAF (V600E) oncoprotein by the small-molecule drug PLX4032 (vemurafenib) is highly effective in the treatment of melanoma. However, colon cancer patients carrying the same BRAF oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show a limited response.\n\nLooking into the causative mechanism of this observation, members of the Coltheres consortium have found that BRAF inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, supporting continued CRC proliferation. This also indicates that BRAF mutant colon cancers might benefit from combinatorial therapy consisting of BRAF and EGFR inhibitors.\n\nImportantly, the consortium has been able to detect these mutations in the blood of patients several months before radiographic evidence of disease progression.
