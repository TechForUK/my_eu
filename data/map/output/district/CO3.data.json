We don't (have to) hide from the purely academic (general) education system.  Rather, we emphasize our vocational background. Because our core value is our vocational identity it makes us very strong in offering useful qualifications for our students that suit the demands of our labour market.  We also allow our staff a deep insight into other European VET systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are planning two kinds of activities that reflect on the topics chosen: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelated to topic 1. Teach and Learn Foreign Languages:\r\n\r\nSending out language teachers to the places, where the language is spoken. Mainly we are planning to send our modern language teachers to official European training courses. But we also want to offer opportunities to teach at our partner schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelated to topic 2. Innovative Curricula / pedagogical Methods / Development of Teaching Courses and \r\n\r\nrelated to topic 3. Institutions and / or Methods to Enhance Quality (incl. School Development): \r\n\r\nIn essence we want to offer our participants  \"Teaching Observations\" or  \"Job-Shadowings\" at our partner schools and if possible even teach at our partner colleges (if possible, concerning the language). We want to learn from our partners what other / new processes we could take home and adapt. But we are also interested in finding and adapting new structures and maybe even introduce new training courses. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy doing so, we use the skills of our participants to fullfill our  guidelines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Our VISON is: We are THE authority of competence in our region and enable qualifications for life and work. Our MISSION is:  We  shape an education that transports key competences for an ever-changing working life.  That means: We  demand from our students to work on their competences and also promote our students adequately and individually.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell-trained staff are motivated to teach (very well) and also motivate their students to partake in our European projects. Therefore, we promote the will to be mobile in working life, since our students may need to move to places with more opportunities after their successful training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLast but not least, we at BBZ Schleswig are highly interested in becoming a European school  (http://www.europaschulen-sh.de/).", "http://www.colchester.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA101-000723_2"], ["3LL", "Crecemos con la Formaci\u00f3n en Europa 3", "COLCHESTER INSTITUTE", 59545.0, "The IES Cartuja from Granada submits this Erasmus+ project for the internships in companies of its students and for the Training of its teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mobility of the teachers will consist on study visits in order to know how the \u201cDual Vocational Training\u201d is working in other European Union countries. Teachers would visit educational centres teaching Dual Vocational Training, where students develop their training: part of the time in the educational centre and part of them time in the companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dual Vocational Training is developed in the IES Cartuja in an experimental way, as the IES Cartuja is considered a reference school in the implementation of ICT technologies and having received several Prizes and Honour Mentions due to the development of National and European projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce that they have started to teach the Dual Vocational Trainng, the IES Cartuja wants to share its experience with other schools of other European counties and get to know and learn from their experience too. The work fields in these visits would include: getting to know and visit companies, training programmes, administrative management field, monitoring strategiest, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IES Cartuja is convinced that for the educational improvement it is essential the existence of proceedings of evaluation and dissemination of those experiences contributing to the acquisition of competences by the students. This project is a good opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will consist of two flows of 6 teachers and professionals each with a duration of one week each. The period planned would not disturb the normal running of lessons in the IES, since in that period (for exmample April and May 2015) an important number of students would be carrying out the FCT so that it would be easier to replace these teachers in that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the profile of the teachers, it is outstanding the long experience in the development of European educational projects. The two flows would visit two very important European countries in terms of Dual Vocational Training, such as: England and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other project action is aimed at students of Initial Vocational Training (FPGM) of the Administrative Management specialty and to students of Basic Vocational Training of Administrative Services from the IES Cartuja.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce that the project will be approved, to ensure the quality of the project, the IES Cartuja has decided to count on the help of an organisation in Italy, with extensive experience in such projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IES Cartuja is located in one of the poorest quarters of the city of Granada. Therefore, students in this school come from poor families and belong to risk groups. Students work very hard to eliminate social stereotypes and to get a training to help them improve their socioeconomic situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday it is necessary to have work experience to find a job. And most important is to develop and demonstrate work experience in other countries, something that is difficult in this environment. Besides, it is essential the acquisition of language skills provided by this type of experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough this project we want to ensure equal opportunities for students of IES Cartuja and students from families with a higher socioeconomic status. The main objective of the project is to give these students a beneficial experience to help them in their personal and professional career in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project for students will be developed in Italy. The IES Cartuja plans to send to Italy three flow: two of five students each of the Initial Vocational Trainig (CFGM) with a duration of 74 days each, and a third flow of 4 students of Basic Vocational Training for 16 days with an accompanying teacher.

The project plans the mobility of 10 participants of Initial Vocational Training and 10 participants of Basic Vocational Training divided into two flows during the academic year 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. The School also wants to send 14 teachers divided into two flows, one per year, for job-shadowing activities in a Vocational Training School.The duration of the stay for students of Basic Vocational training will be three weeks, the first year in Portugal and the second one in Italy, both starting in March and accompanied by a teacher. These students come from three different specialities, so the internships will be related to the field of IT, Vehicle Repair and Electrical Installations. Regarding the students of Initial Vocational Training, there are four specialties included in the project. The mobility of the specialties of Vehicle Body Work, Electrical and Automatic Installations as well as Microcomputer Systems and Networks will last for 11 weeks starting in March, and the destinations will be Italy, Germany and Ireland respectively.

All the participants will fill out reports during their stay and the students will complete a daily internship record. The receiving organisations will also complete reports that will be sent to the School in order to ensure the proper monitoring of the mobility.   Finally, the stage of evaluation and dissemination of results will take place. At the end of the mobility, the participants will obtain a Europass Mobility and a certificate issued by the receiving organisation. In the case of students, this experience will be recognised as the module Training at the Workplace. Once the participants have gone back, the IESPHL will carry out an evaluation with the participants and conclusions of the project will be obtained. In addition, the participants will complete a report which will be used to assess the strong and weak aspects of the project. The Mobility Commission will meet to evaluate the management and results of the project.The dissemination of results will be done by local press means, the web pages of the school and the partners, as well as the VALOR Dissemination Platform.With this project we would like to increase the employment possibilities and ensure equality for the students of IESPHL.
