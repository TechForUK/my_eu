Chemical oxidation is both hazardous and has high environment impacts. Many oxidative bio-catalytic reactions and transformations have been identified in academic laboratories but only a very small number have been applied by industry to oxidize non-natural substrates.\nHence biocatalysis for oxidative chemical manufacture processes can deliver a major advantage to the European chemical-using industries and the environment. In this project we intend to develop the tools for implementation of bio-oxidation to synthesize and oxidize alcohols.\nCytochrome P450 enzymes will be investigated for hydroxylation of fatty acid derivatives and terpenes which have potential to be used in biopolymers and fragrance chemicals respectively form one line of investigation. The second is the selective oxidation of primary alcohols to give products with added value in their own right and as intermediates towards other valuable products.\nTo support the implementation culture collections and literature reported DNA sequences will be used to identify diverse enzymes with predicted oxidase activities, which will be used as starting point for an enzyme improvement program. Then fermentation and enzyme formulation techniques will improve reaction performance to a level where useful quantities of target products can be produced for evaluation by industrial partners, and engineering techniques will analyse and implement reactor configurations that will further improve this technology platform to enable this technology to be introduced as a routine technology in the IB industry and support the European KBBE.\nFurther a dynamic public engagement and dissemination program will be used to promote the project, IB and the FP7 program within the science community and the public, especially schoolchildren, to create extra value for the funders.", 352951.0, 5945848.0, "BIOOX", "Using biology for chemical production", "Researchers are harnessing natural chemical reactions that take place in the cells of almost every living organism to replace hazardous chemical synthesis of products.", "Oxidation is a chemical reaction used in industry to produce chemicals and consumer products and to treat waste streams. Since chemical oxidation is hazardous and environmentally unfriendly, scientists are looking to nature to perform oxidation reactions naturally and safely.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.bioox.eu/ (BIOOX) (Developing a validated technology platform for the application of oxygen dependent enzymes in synthesis and transformation of alcohols) project aims to develop a suite of biological enzymes (known as biocatalysts) that perform oxidation reactions for industrial-scale production of chemicals.\n\nAfter selecting diverse enzymes with predicted oxidase properties, BIOOX developed microbial strains and methods for producing these enzymes in bioreactors. Researchers then formulated techniques to improve the best enzymes' activities, and to increase their yield from engineered bacterial and fungal strains.\n\nBIOOX is now looking at alternative ways to use their improved enzymes for synthesising industrial-scale chemical compounds economically. As an alternative to purifying enzymes from microbes, for example, they developed an Escherichia coli strain that performs the oxidation reaction inside the bacterial cell.\n\nThey also designed a way to immobilise purified enzymes in flow reactors that, unlike batch reactors, allow reactions to occur continuously rather than in batches. In this case, substrates that flow into the vessel become oxidised by the immobilised enzymes, and the resulting product is removed in a continuous cycle.\n\nBIOOX will now scale-up newly developed reactors for evaluation by industry partners.

The main target is applications of lyase enzymes to selectively synthesize molecules with multiple chiral centres applying enzymatic carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond formation as the key technical platforms. We will then apply synthetic biology to improve fermentation processes in order to generate better enzymes.  Chiral compounds are an important class of chemicals that biocatalytic transformation has already demonstrated great potential to compete with chemocatalysts in their production with associated benefits that come from reductions in use of organic solvents, toxic metals and energy but application has been relatively limited. KYROBIO will address the main challenges with moving forward to the next generation of added value industrial applications of white biotechnology for high value chemical synthesis.\nUsing a supradisciplinary approach ranging from enzyme development, chemistry, molecular biology, fermentation and innovative isolation techniques the bottlenecks to applying this new technology will be overcome. It is expected that promising candidate chemicals will be commercialised within three years of completion and so scale up with economic and feasibility studies that are also key technology developments.\nThe consortium includes a strong presence of SMEs including SME leadership and also a large multinational company which ensures multiple routes to market for the outcomes of this project. We will also have economic and life cycle analysis coupled with significant dissemination plans to ensure wider understanding of this technology that will lead to increased acceptance and uptake.

In particular, chiral compounds are those that are mirror images of each other and the enantiomers are the two different forms. Because structural differences affect function, different enantiomers of the same compound can have different activities as drugs or catalysts of chemical reactions.\n\nSingle-enantiomer chiral compounds are an industrially important class of chemicals often used in catalysis. Biocatalysts (enzymes) offer an important alternative to chemical catalysts for reducing the use of organic solvents, toxic metals and energy. Scientists initiated the EU-funded project http://www.kyrobio.eu/ (KYROBIO) to increase the currently limited availability of the lyase class of enzymes that selectively synthesises molecules with multiple chiral centres.\n\nLyases form chirally pure compounds that are important in the manufacture of high-value pharmaceutical and specialty chemical products. KYROBIO is developing new classes of lyases and the processes required for exploitation. In addition, the consortium is reducing cost barriers by applying synthetic biotechnology to improve fermentation processes for enzyme production.\n\nAt the end of the first 30 months of the 4-year project, scientists are delivering on the project's promise with new enzymes and processes together with economic analyses of the catalysed reactions. The developments are supported by a toolbox of techniques, including those related to bioinformatics, molecular modelling, high-throughput enzyme generation and plant transcriptome analyses. These technologies greatly reduce experimental screening of mutants and materials used, simultaneously enabling more effective achievement of targeted properties.\n\nKYROBIO emphasises dissemination of green chemistry to a broad audience of industry leaders, academics, policymakers and the public. Researchers are conducting a vigorous public outreach campaign. A series of networking events, webinars, and public science education and training events have already taken place.

The proposed consortium, with 50% industrial participation, represents academia but also commercial interests in different stages of the research-to-market process. This top-down approach, together with a life-cycle innovation approach ensures an industrial drive to the project.\nClearly aligned with the scope of topic BIOTEC3-2014, CARBAZYMES will pursue the biocatalytic synthesis (spanning TRLs 5-7) of 4 APIs and 3 bulk chemicals \u2013corresponding to market needs detected by the industrial partners in the Consortium. This will be accomplished through an inter-disciplinary approach which includes: i) a broad platform of 4 types of unique C-C bond-forming enzymes, mostly lyases; ii) the capacity to rapidly evolve enzymes to operate under industrial conditions by means of novel enzyme panels and massive screening methods; iii) application of microreactor technology for bioprocess characterization; iv) demonstration actions comprising technical (up to 100L) and economic viability studies carried out by industrial partners.\nCARBAZYMES unmistakably aims to have social and economic impact by addressing markets worth bn \u20ac, developing enzyme evolution technologies beyond the state of the art and creating qualified jobs and technical-scale facilities at the industrial partners\u2019 sites.

However, advancement of this field is slow because (a) glycans have immense structural complexity resulting in major technical challenges for their analysis and (b) there is a lack of experts with required glycoanalytical skills. GlySign will address this gap by training six young scientists within an innovative training-by-research programme with high industrial-academic mobility to eventually push forward the translation of novel glycomics-based diagnostic tools into clinical practice. This will be achieved by further developing a range of selective and sensitive glycomics technologies for the analysis of samples from patients and healthy controls in close collaboration between industry/academia as well as clinical chemists and clinicians who will be the end users of GlySign\u2019s final products.
