The consortium is coordinated by IIS J.F. Kennedy.The project will involve 110 students of the penultimate year before the diploma; the mobility will be of 5 weeks, in summer 2017, heading to France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, United Kingdom. Before the departure, the participants will receive accurate preparation activities. The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit. Together with the enhancement of linguistic and professional \u201ctools\u201d, the project highlighted the intercultural consciousness as one of the essential competences to start up a revival processes which might favour the employment linked to the potential touristic attractiveness of the territory.The touristic offer can be innovative if it is gifted also on a human level personalisation, which requires the operators to master some competences to be improved through the transnational mobility. These competences concern some soft skills such as ability to have an open vision towards society, relational skills, self-entrepreneurship, flexibility personal organisation as well as specific technical skills.  The professional profiles involved are related to Tourism and other linked sectors: services (marketing and administration, information technology, restaurants and hotel accommodation), agri-food and environment management.The common goals to the different professional profiles are aimed at the acquisition or enhancement of the following skills:1-To interact by using Foreign languages 2- To positively face new cultural contexts, 3- To adapt to unfamiliar situations, to be flexible, mindful and interested towards new experiences and to live them as a learning opportunity 4-To practise personal autonomy by means of daily training of self-organization and of stress management5- To build-up constructive relationships and to take charge of responsibilities at work  6- To acquire or develop some professional skills The mobility is integrated in the sending school curriculum and it is recognised as equivalent to the school-work Alternance (work based learning); therefore, the application of ECVET procedures in organizing and implementing the work experience abroad will enable the recognition of credits. The participants will also receive the Europass Mobility Document, the Certificate of Competencies, in addition to the other certifications foreseen, which will enrich the personal portfolio for entering the labour market.The continuity with the previous Project editions strengthens the collaboration of the members of the national and international partnership, and it improves the shared practices applied to organize, manage and evaluate the mobility. This continuity is also a condition for the success of the Mobility experience, whose impact will be measured by a follow-up Observatory of the sending schools in the three years after the conclusion of the Project.

Key Enabling Technologies such as advanced materials, nanotechnology, biotechnology are increasingly having a transformative effect on the sector. ICTs are having a highly significant impact on manufacturing processes with ICT enabled processes such as computer integrated manufacturing, \u201cdigital factories\u201d, etc. Companies require the adoption of new internationalisation strategies aimed not only at cost reduction but at quality improvement and more advanced techniques.Against this background teachers agree on the manifold benefits of work-based learning experiences abroad allowing learners to enrich and expand classroom learning, to show them how concepts and theories are applied in practical situations in multicultural working contexts; to offer learners access to tools, equipment and facilities generally not available in schools. The project fits into school-work alternance scheme aimed at providing learners\u2019 with supervised hands-on, curriculum-related working experiences. A school-work alternance experience abroad means a whole set of different requirements for a student compared to a work placement in the home country. Moreover, experiencing life and work abroad involve the continuous use of the language in different situations: this will benefit the students not only because it strengthens their knowledge of the foreign language but also because it develops the essential communication skills for business & social interaction in a multicultural environment.

The internationalization of the techniques and tools used in schools would allow teachers to implement a more attractive teaching method, able to enhance socio-affective skills, to intercept different cognitive styles, to focus on the difficulties of each student in order to reduce the percentage of school dropouts, as required by the ET2020 strategic framework. \r\nThe project revolves around the issue of school dropout, which is a multidimensional phenomenon that goes beyond the school context itself and that depends also on the adolescent\u2019s life and social environment. The framework of the context refers to users with low rates of study motivation and high levels of school dropout in an area at high social risk in which the school discomfort can no longer be considered as an emergency, but actually as a structural feature of the training system and this calls for a new revision. A training course led abroad would enable teachers, through their comparison with colleagues from other countries, to acquire new group class management techniques in order to detect and prevent the phenomena of school drop-out, which undoubtedly represents an element to counteract.\r\nThe teachers that will take part in this project are highly motivated to increase their  didactic, methodological, linguistic  competencies as well as ICT abilities, in order to improve the educational offer of that the Institute, promoting this project, is able to deliver.\r\nThe main aims that the project is going to pursue are the following: \r\n- to explore, develop and evaluate the best practices resulting from the cooperation of a large group of teachers and educators;\r\n- to attend English language courses in order to reach level B2 in anticipation of a possible CLIL course;\r\n- to acquire language skills in L2 for professional debates and prepare more interesting teaching materials and tools able to adapt to different learning needs;\r\n-to reduce the level of early school drop-out;\r\nThe number of participants will be of 15 people, and they will be selected among the teaching and management staff of the Institute and the group will live an experience functional to the improvement and strengthening of their competencies within the partner institutes in United Kingdom, which are, more precisely, the Conlan School in St. Asaph and the Tellus Education Group in Plymouth, coordinated by T.E.E.P. \u2013 Training Education and European Project. \r\nThe activities planned and offered by the Institute are the following:\r\n- statistical analysis of cohorts, analysis of the criteria of selection of those students resulting more at risk; \r\n- use of active listening techniques and peer-tutoring so as to identify difficulties and/or criticisms;   \r\n- personalized interventions;\r\n- feedback and evaluation results.\r\nThe need to evaluate students\u2019 performance, along with the implicit/explicit expressions of discomfort is not new, but the methodological tools of research characterizing this project are innovative, based on a \u201cpreventive approach\u201d and connected to aspects of both statistical and psycho-pedagogical nature. \r\nThe project will monitor the impact on the general didactic activity of the institute and will evaluate whether the training activities carried out abroad will have triggered the change and innovation desired.

Arts practices can have a significant impact on education research; for instance, drama, music, dance and visual arts can be used to: understand how learners internalise mathematical concepts, reflect on how decisions are made in the midst of action in leadership education, or investigate the use of the intuitive alongside the rational and analytical in the educational experience of engineering students. These and many other methods of arts-based research can be used as a lens to provide unique insights into the learning processes that lie beyond the scope of conventional text- or number-based educational research.Non-textual arts-based forms of research can provide valuable insights into pedagogical and professional practices not only within the arts but especially when applied to fields that normally lie outside of the arts.

The outcome will be an agreed definition of the role and competences of the administrators which will act as a specification for the modular training to be developed and piloted as an exemplar during the project.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT WILL PRODUCE REAL IMPACT AND LEGACY\r\nThis framework has huge potential to encourage and support learning and employment mobility for the administrators and to put transparency into qualifications developed in different countries and sports but to the same template (the common agreed standards in the framework) and linked to EQF and ECVET. It is aimed at an occupation at the centre of the future growth and development of sport and can therefore have real impact on the real world of sport\u2026 potentially impacting a growing sector (over 800,000 full time employees and 35 million volunteers in the EU) and in fine the life of the EU citizens.\r\n\r\n+ THE PROJECT IS BUILT ON A STRONG PARTNERSHIP\r\nThe Project Partnership is strong, involving 12 partners from 10 countries: 8 national organisations and 4 pan-European Associations (EFCS, EOSE, ISCA and Tennis Europe).

Initiatives start and end in the community, and the end is always a new beginning. Learning, capacity-building and empowerment takes place through community, not prior to or isolated from it and is always linked to an authentic situation, an emerging need, not to an abstract dictum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first year the project will work side-by side with the first group of adults, learning to create and practice step by step the community action mentality. This \u2018Breaking Down\u2019 year will take as its starting point the life and work situation of the long-term unemployed adults, and identify opportunities and potential resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn initial group of 10-20 adults will be established by each local partner, who will be supported to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 slowly increase capacity to address the community\r\n\r\n\u2022 build up small eco-systems of networks as a consequence of their efforts\r\n\r\n\u2022 directly benefit from their entrepreneurial actions or take further action for change \r\n\r\n\u2022 mentor other adults and contribute to the Virtual Guidance services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Year 2, second local groups of 10-20 adults are helped, this time mentored by a team of unemployed adults from the first year.

They will build up important community relations and networks in support of their missions, supervise and support adults and mentors and serve as key players in the virtual guidance services.

European schools are increasingly finding themselves on the frontline expected to be able to deal with diversity-related issues. Opportunities to experience diversity as educational enrichment are too often lost. Teachers struggle with inadequate pedagogical repertoires to work with and put into value diverse pupil populations and wider communities. Neglected groups and individuals too readily drop out from education as a result of an inadequate learning environment.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address the diversity challenge and its negative consequences by improving the provision of intercultural competence and understanding in pre- and in-service teacher education. We contend that by broadening teachers\u2019 pedagogic repertoires, awareness and understanding of diversity, the number of early school leavers will be reduced and diversity can be an enrichment rather than a challenge for European education.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to: \r\n1. increase student teacher knowledge, awareness and understanding, \r\n2. involve student teachers in developing intervention and compensation measures designed to keep pupils in education and increase the resilience of at-risk pupils, \r\n3. educate student teachers to build bridges between formal, non-formal and informal education drawing on the resources and potentials of different local educational communities, \r\n4. build capacity in innovative, cross-disciplinary teaching and research methodologies at all partner institutions\r\n5. design a module to be implemented in teacher education programmes widening the provision of intercultural education in pre- and in-service contexts. \r\n\r\nThe participants from eight higher education institutions create a broad base of expertise for the project and key channels for the implementation of the resulting module. The participating institutions represent expertise in drama and arts-based education, adventure and language education, cultural geography, ICT, teacher development and action research. The partners have a track record of positive collaborations and shared interests, with complementary areas of expertise. In addition, 96 teacher students from all eight institutions and different disciplinary backgrounds will take part in the intensive courses. Other stakeholders, such as decision makers in the education systems as well in service teachers will be addressed. \r\nThe activities of the project divide into project management activities and educational tasks. Project management includes planning meetings, project evaluation and dissemination tasks divided between the partners. Educational tasks include three intensive courses and cross-disciplinary methodologies, developing and piloting the course. Dissemination tasks include online publishing of resources, a pedagogical guide for teachers and multipliers, as well as publications in teaching oriented pedagogical journals.\r\n\r\nThe methodology draws on action research principles to build cross-disciplinary capacity among staff and at partner institutions.

Such needs are:- the need to re-engage seniors of all ages and backgrounds in the production of economic and social value- the need to find new solutions to existing and emerging social challenges not addressed by the open market and not sufficiently addressable by public services- the need to engage users, clients and citizens in creating such solutions- the need to create dynamic social change mechanisms to respond flexibly to the fast changing global and local economies, social infrastructures and labour marketsEMERGING CHANGE OPPORTUNITIESThese include such opportunities generated by increasing consensus among policy-makers, researchers and professionals on what kind of innovation is needed, possible and attractive, and what innovation means \u2013 including recent re-thinking of the terms innovation, social innovation and social economy.These opportunities for change recognise :- recognising that social innovation is a driver of and contributor to economic growth- recognising that social entrepreneurship goes far beyond establishing a private company and embraces all sorts of initiative-taking, whether for profit or not- recognising that authentic social innovation cannot happen to but with people, and that social innovation needs top-down as well as bottom-up initiative-taking to be successful- recognising that social innovation includes a wide range of societal challengesPROJECT MISSIONThe project objective is to mobilise teams of seniors in participating project communities and beyond to build capacity among them to serve as SOCIAL CHANGE BROKERS in these communities, spotting social change needs, bringing together relevant stakeholders and citizens and facilitate or drive the social change process, and to exploit the social change processes to sustain their activity through creating appropriate organisational frameworks, be it as volunteers, association members, employees, consultants or social service providers.The project brings together 3 top priorities in Europe 2020 policy:1. The need to retain or re-engage the increasing number of European seniors as active social and economic contributors2. The need to bring about social innovation as an alternative to traditional public services3. The need to promote entrepreneurial mind-sets and initiative-taking in the communitiesThe project brings together those policy needs in a strong, systematic and sustainable, yet practical and realistic way: - it will mobilise groups of seniors in EU communities to build capacity to act as SOCIAL CHANGE BROKERS in the communities, identifying social change needs and facilitating the change process by bringing together relevant stakeholders across relevant sectors, including activating citizens as co-drivers of social change.A senior social entrepreneur can be a CATALYST of social change.PARTNERSHIPThe consortium brings together 8 partners from 6 EU countries: practice partners, knowledge partner and an experienced quality partner.The Municipality of Aarhus, Denmark, coordinates the project.OUTCOMESThe project will along its 24 months duration produce the following key outcomes:SENIOR SOCIAL RESOURCE CENTER SUPPORTI AM A SOCIAL CHANGE BROKER \u2013 WHAT R U?PORTFOLIOS OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURINGPOLICY PAPER \u2013 LESSONS LEARNED FROM SENIOR SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURINGPOLICY PAPER/GUIDANCE \u2013 EUROPEAN FUNDING AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURINGResulting from the continuous transnational networking of seniors through the project and serving as platform for further European initiatives a network will be established by the seniors engaged in the various phases of the project, including:- senior social change brokers from the first group, serving as mentors for new seniors along the project- second group senior social change brokers mobilised and capacity built through the project- seniors engaged through the collaboration with what is called neighbouring communities and communities in other countriesNew initiatives can build on the lessons learned from the project and similar  and might address a variety of EU funding measures.In particular, the project aims to create a qualified EaSI initiative to be submitted in 2017 or 2018, taking the Senior Social Entrepreneuring and similars.", "http://www.chester.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA204-022286_4"], [2015, "Open The Doors - New Directions in NEET prevention through teacher capacity building", "UNIVERSITY OF CHESTER", 109745.0, 7, 10, "Open The Doors - New Directions in NEET prevention\r\n\r\n\u201cTeachers cannot teach how to be entrepreneurial without themselves being entrepreneurial.

The careful management of air flow within a building forms part of this strategy through the control of inlet fresh air and exhaust air, maximising air re-circulation, and minimising the amount of fresh air which is often drawn in through a heat exchanger. However, there is a high risk that the air quality is reduced. Continued exposure to environments with poor air quality is a major public health concern in developed and developing countries. It is estimated that the pollutants responsible for poor air quality cause nearly 2.5 million premature deaths per year world-wide. Significantly, around 1.5 million of these deaths are due to polluted indoor air, and it is suggested that poor indoor air quality may pose a significant health risk to more than half of the world\u2019s population. Perhaps surprisingly, remedial action to improve air quality is often easy to implement. Relatively simple measures such as increased air flow through ventilation systems, or a greater proportion of fresh air to re-circulating air are sufficient to improve air quality. Low-energy air purification and detoxification technologies are available which will reduce the concentration of specific pollutants. Similarly, filtration systems (e.g. electrostatic filters) can be switched in to reduce the level of the particulate matter in the air (the principle pollutant responsible for poor health).

In Ohmic heating, foods are made part of an electric circuit and heat is generated within the foods due to their electrical resistance. The process offers advantages such as rapid uniform heating, reduced surface fouling, high energy efficiency and high quality food products. Ohmic heating has potential to be dominant in the food processing industry. However, the potential is supressed by technical deficiencies such as electrode design problems, inefficient pump design, and lack of control in electrical conductivity, which limit the technology\u2019s extensive application. Ohmic heating currently processes 8% of the global fruits and vegetables production, but if the technical incapacities are solved, it has the potential to process over 35% of this sectors requirements, creating a market opportunity of \u20ac85 billion.\nOHFASTT give breakthrough Ohmic heating technology capable of producing high quality food through advanced engineered solutions to problems that have hampered the uptake of Ohmic heating. This will realise a new commercially attractive technology to the EU and global markets. Food processing companies will benefit through a15% reduction in energy use and a subsequent 8% reduction in energy costs. This will reduce CO2 emissions by 16.6% and thus prevent the emission of a total of 326,808 tonnes of CO2 globally every year.

Project will advance recent innovations towards preparation of ordered nanoporous, nanostructured materials using anodisation methods and applying them to develop commercially relevant novel materials and address the market potential for these improved materials. The nanostructuring process is the growth, during the anodising process, of nanoporous films consisting of well-ordered pores of Anodic Al Oxide in hexagonally close-packed distribution with large aspect ratio. The concept of self-assembly is not yet implemented in actual anodising Al processes due to a number of bottle-necks; project aims at developing pilot line equipment and methodologies enabling to overcome them. The objective is to solve actual market needs by achieving the single stage treatment and industrial evaluation of nanostructured aluminium alloys. The overall research methodology of the Nanocoat project will follow a progression from detailed laboratory studies through scale-up to applications testing on industrial aluminium grades under industrial relevant conditions, to evaluate their structural and functional characteristics, the reproducibility of the process, and to deliver to end-users suitable test structures as predemonstrators. It is expected that on controlling the formation of the anodised nano-size cell structures on aluminium it will be possible to achieve novel performance in terms of adherence, wettability, corrosion and wear, and adsorption/absorption properties. The scope of applications is very large in the field of surface engineering.

The building blocks will have three broad pillars: one focused on PM efficiency (being Lean), one on PM systems that meet the psycho-social needs of project staff (being Seen) and one on making PM responsive to the need of organisations to be innovative and manage change (being Lean and Seen). The programme will cater for different contexts of project delivery in developed and developing countries, to reflect the global and interconnectedness nature of projects.  A network of five academic partners, including one from a developing country and five non-academic, will deliver the holistic PM framework to guide project delivery in the future.
