Some data on what may be considered Beyond GDP indicators are being collected by official statistics offices, but they appear not to be considered in policy making or are given a peripheral role.\nThe central assumption of the project is that indicators, if effectively embedded in the policy making process, are an effective transmission mechanism to connect research and policy. The aim of the project is therefore to enhance and speed up both the development and the effective use of indicators that can balance the use of GDP so as to support the sustainable development policy process in the EU.\nIdeally, indicator users need to be aware of the knowledge that exists, and vice versa indicator producers need to be aware of the context(s) in which the indicators will be used. Indicators should be developed as part of an interactive process with multiple feedbacks that ensure that user demands are taken up in the production of alternative indicators. Besides this knowledge gap, it needs also to be understood as part of a change process, in which one has to overcome various other barriers that prevent the existing research from being acted on.\nThe BRAINPOoL project approaches this problem as a mismatch between demand and supply and aims to solve this via action research and knowledge brokerage activities. This is done by:\n\u2022\tStructuring the research reservoir on Beyond GDP indicators by synthesising existing overviews of Beyond GDP indicators, and assessing the degree to which they have been taken up in policy making;\n\u2022\tIncreasing the understanding of the user context of Beyond GDP indicators;\n\u2022\tStimulating user-producer interactions by organising meetings, discussions and workshops and improving the relation between users and producers at different levels;\n\u2022\tConsolidating and structuring a follow-up beyond the duration of BRAIN POoL by establishing institutional structures and/or feeds into existing ones in such a way that interactions between indicator producers and users will be sustained.\nThroughout the project linkages will be established with relevant target groups, such as policy makers on different levels, statistical offices, and planning agencies.", 172760.0, 1374090.0, "BRAINPOoL", "Alternative indicators for policymaking", "An EU initiative aimed to increase the influence of more inclusive alternatives to the gross domestic product (GDP) indicator that represent progress in a broader sense.

A key constraint to reaching the sector targets therefore appears to be the lack of systems to assess the potential of a technology and lack of ability to take new appropriate technologies to scale effectively. WASHTech seeks to address the problem through research on an innovatory process for assessing the potential and sustainability of a wide range of new technologies, and for designing successful strategies for scaling up.\nThe overall development objective is for more effective investment in new technologies to achieve MDG targets. The project (WASHTECH) objective is to strengthen sector capacity to make effective investment in new technologies, through development of a framework which assesses the potential of new technologies introduced into innovative de-centralised systems.\nThe project objective would be achieved through research producing two levels of outputs.

The aim is to enable a patient\u2019s nervous system to communicate with new devices that replace or supplement a malfunctioning organ, for example to restore hearing or eyesight or to treat degenerative diseases like Parkinson\u2019s.   Human functional enhancement technology refers to a wide range of converging technologies which have the potential to enable significant modification of the systems of the human body, beyond what might be seen as medical purposes. The subjects of the ETHENTECH project address some of the most far-reaching fields among new and emerging technologies today - in terms of their potential social impact and the challenges these will pose to ethical issues and values of European citizens and societies. The project\u2019s two fields of implant and human enhancement technologies both lack ethical frameworks and European and international guidelines. This absence reflects the emerging and complex nature of both areas. They also represent cases where issues of dual use are a significant and further complicating factor.

This project will enable us to drive forward  further in our mission to innovate our EAL practice, inextricably tied as this is to our dedication for social justice and the highest quality education for all our pupils, regardless of their cultural and linguistic background. We aim to not only develop good English-speaking learners, but good bi- and multi-lingual learners who can feel safe in knowing their multicultural backgrounds are a wonderful asset which should be allowed to thrive, rather than be perceived as a deficit.  \r\n\r\nThe benefits of European citizenship are clear to all of us in our school and as a school we have a responsibility to provide the best opportunities  in life for our pupils. Once our members of staff become engaged in this project they will be able to transfer this European vision across to our pupils through the development of their teaching practice and increased inter-cultural awareness. This funding will allow us to engender in our pupils a thirst for appreciating and learning from multicultural environments and peoples and ensure that as they continue to grow that they have an open-minded and positive inter-cultural perspective to pass on to future generations. \r\n\r\nThe Henry Fawcett core team will return with a wider inter-cultural approach to providing  the best opportunities for all our pupils to develop their learning after shadowing European colleagues and having the chance to discuss strategies and impact . We also expect participants to engage more parents in their children's education and create opportunities for the parents to be part of activities during curriculum time, in order to build our children and parents' confidence and self-esteem. Our focus on developing school partnerships with Portuguese and Spanish countries is also to increase the impact of learning languages and better understand bilingual speaking learning environments, as well as to develop our Science, P.E. and outdoor learning. Research has shown that children will engage more in school life when learning a language for a purpose, not only to communicate but also to increase their subject knowledge. Therefore our links with Portugal and Spain will aim to develop resources , curriculum and the achievement of our EAL pupils. \r\n\r\nThrough the job shadowing we also would like to learn more from how countries like Sweden and Finland,  well known for successful integration of families from refugee backgrounds, provide comprehensive structures into education which take into account the deeply traumatic experiences that some of these pupils have often been witness to as part of their migration journeys.\r\n\r\nHenry Fawcett Primary School is proud to say that we wish to provide a similarly excellent practice in welcoming multicultural families to our school and we are eager to learn the best practices from European partners who have successfully developed such programmes.", "http://www.henryfawcett.co.uk/", "Henry Fawcett Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035997_coordinator"], ["5LG", "Creativity for Early Years Science Education training course", "Vauxhall Primary School", 3925.0, "The training course aims and objectives promote the overall objective:\r\nTo foster creative approaches to science teaching and learning in preschool and the first years of primary school.\r\n\r\nIt will bring together practitioners from throughout Europe to build effective community networks, support teacher's professional development, design innovative scenarios and assess the impact of interventions. \r\n\r\nThe training will result in short term and long term benefits.

This is one of the most important factors that has a real influence on a successful return to the society of such people. \u201eBusola\u201d association was brought into existence to organize various forms of educational activities for people that are set in prison. Thanks to such programmes like \u201eLifelong learning\u201d or Erasmus+ it was possible to create a network of professionals who work in the field of prison education and at the same time it was possible to give the beginning to the cooperation within KA1 action, the effect of which is the present project. \r\n\r\nPeople who work outside prison walls very often have very little insight into how specific and characteristic are conditions of working with inmates and what challenges there are in front of those who deal with people staying in prisons. \r\n\r\n \u201cEducation behind bars\u201d project will enable those who will take part in it, the possibility of broadening their own horizons, exchange of experiences with colleagues working in the same field in different EU countries. We think that thanks to the international cooperation we will be able to inculcate on Polish ground some ideas overseen in other European countries which, in turn, will turn out to be a great supplement (or a brand new undertaking) of an educational offer for prisoners. We want this project to be a contribution to a bigger number of new ideas borrowed from host institutions. Ideas that we want to borrow are all connected with the use of art or sport as the means of social rehabilitation, methods of teaching/learning foreign languages or ICT in the conditions of prison isolation, etc.\r\n\r\nAll those who will take part in the mobilities within the \u201cEducation behind bars\u201d project are members of the association and at the same time they are active educators working in the field of imprisoned people. We hope that thanks to this cooperation all engaged parties will take advantage of it and will acquire new knowledge. Thanks to internationalisation of the project, we believe that we will gain new skills that ultimately will be used while working with inmates. Experience shows that mutual learning/teaching, taking part in training sessions, training conferences and job-shadowing, always prove to be extremely successful, fruitful and inspiring to further activities. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we assume that we will manage to broaden even more the network of people engaged into education of prisoners.

At Charlotte Sharman School,  we are seeking to create an international vision, in line with the requirements of the current MFL curriculum, that all Key Stage 2 pupils have access to quality teaching of a modern foreign language. In addition, a growing proportion of our pupils come from Spanish speaking backgrounds and their parents do not have a strong command of English. A further strategic aim is to ensure that all staff working in KS2 will be able to communicate effectively with the parents in the school community to encourage more parental participation in children's learning. \r\n\r\nIn our most recent Ofsted inspection (April 2015), our school achieved 'good'. It was noted that our school has a very multicultural learning environment, seeing evidence of international events to promote understanding of other countries. Senior leaders took this information, alongside the School Improvement Plan (the journey towards 'outstanding') and could see that in order to reach that target of having a fully balanced creative curriculum, we needed to provide a much more in-depth experience of speaking a modern foreign language. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to obtain funding that we need in order to address the modern foreign language curriculum needs identified in our School Improvement Plan. \r\n\r\nWe intend to send 8 staff from Key Stage 2 (years 3,4,5 and 6) to Spain for one week immersion training in both 2019 and 2020. The provider is a longstanding Spanish Language Training Centre (Malaca Instituto) in Malaga that has provided training for staff from other schools in our borough over many years, with clear, measurable results. We believe their courses, which address all aspects of language teaching will raise the confidence and capability of our teaching team to deliver lessons successfully. The courses will incorporate intensive immersion in the culture of the language as well as intensive pure language and language teaching methodology classes, supported by contact with local schools and teachers. \r\n\r\nOur key language teaching staff who will be involved in year 1 of the programme will also be part of year 2, thus building on knowledge and skills acquired. On their return from the week's intensive training in year 1, staff will be appointed 'ambassadors for language' within the school, having half termly INSETS meetings to share good practice and continuously keep the teaching and learning of Spanish at the forefront of the school's agenda. \r\n\r\nProgress will be measured through: lesson observations to assess the development of oral communication, listening skills and reading; book looks to assess the impact of quality teaching on written communication and environment checks to assess the development of the language being a visible part of daily school life. We will also make links with other schools in the local area so that our language teaching skills and expertise can be shared with the wider school community.  \r\n\r\nPrior to the second part of the training in year 2, all collected data will be analysed to ascertain gaps within knowledge so staff know what aspects of subject knowledge and skills to focus on and where further development is still needed. After the second training week new or updated strategies will be disseminated throughout the school to further improve Spanish lessons. It will also be our intention to devise strategies and a framework that will begin our pupil's language learning journey much earlier in KS1. Our staff language ambassadors will provide training for Early Years and KS1 teachers so they can immerse young pupils in the language starting at a much earlier age by giving them the confidence to teach Spanish in an interactive way. \r\n\r\nThe impact and result of this long-term training experience will be that we will have a strong, confident and up-skilled teachers improving the daily learning of languages for all children within the school and eventually in the wider local community.", "http://www.charlottesharman.co.uk", "Charlotte Sharman Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047148_coordinator"], ["5RD", "European Humanitarian Action Partnership", "RedR UK (formerly Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief)", 271636.0, "The EU HAP is a partnership of 4 stakeholders of the Humanitarian Sector represented by Academia (NOHA and 9 European Universities), Training Providers (RedR and Bioforce), Employers (Acci\u00f3n Contra el Hambre and Aktion Deutschland Hilft) and Employees (Humanitarian Professionals represented by the NOHA Alumni ). The partnership addresses the current needs of the humanitarian sector: a) increased demand for qualified and trained humanitarian professionals to respond to increasingly complex crises in a sector that employs around 250,000 workers disbursing nearly US$20 billion (2012); b) coordinated approaches to train people that can provide an effective humanitarian response, fulfilling the EU\u00b4S duties reflected in the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid; c) clear progression routes for integrating competent professionals in the labour market; d) mechanisms for recognition and certification of competences in a sector characterized by international mobility and high turnover; and e) understanding of the multidisciplinary nature of the sector. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initiative aims to promote the exchange of best and innovative practices and improve the quality and efficiency of education in order to boost competences, increase employability and improve opportunities and professionalisation. More specifically, the project will a) establish clear linkages between occupations, skills/competences and qualifications in the  sector; b) facilitate the validation and recognition of humanitarian qualifications, identify learning pathways from vocational and other education types in the humanitarian sector to higher education; c) improve access to humanitarian education through a variety of delivery modes and the development of Open Educational Resources; d) promote a transnational community of knowledge & practice by developing an interactive platform of Humanitarian Activity in Europe; e) establish a European Observatory of Humanitarian activity with recognised data collection laboratories in each member state. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEU HAP counts with the  profiles and expertise of its partners: ADH, a German umbrella organization gathering 21 prominent humanitarian NGOs; ACH, an active member of the international network of Action Contre le Faim International with longstanding expertise in training and research;  RedR, a well-known training provider with a vast experience in short, tailor-made courses; and Bioforce, a vocational training centre running long-term training programmes.

Concretely, the PAC project will realise new knowledge and innovative pathways in prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life to improve their social inclusion and empowerment. This project is produced against the background of legal and human rights prisoners have to participate in different prison activities (e.g., in education, sport activities, cultural activities), and being actively involved in the organisation of prison life (e.g., democratic participation, involvement in the organisation of prison activities). \r\nThroughout Europe, more than 1 400 000 people are imprisoned. The prison population is diverse in terms of nationality, ethnicity, languages mastered, age, etc. Although prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life has been related with diverse positive outcomes such as improvement of skills, self-esteem, self-confidence, and better relationships between prisoners and prison staff, it has been found that there is a lack of knowledge about how to develop, implement and support different types of prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life, in particular for diverse groups of prisoners (including prisoners awaiting trial, foreign speaking prisoners, illiterate prisoners, etc.).

This state of play will be based on a review of the literature and the results of an online survey. \r\nSecond, the PAC consortium will focus on developing, testing and implementing innovative learning practises to increase prisoners\u2019 participation and involvement in prison life in 5 European countries (i.e., Belgium, Croatia, Italy, The Netherlands, and United Kingdom), based on this state of play. Using process and product evaluations, these innovative learning areas will be scientifically investigated in order to develop a toolkit for professionals to realise new European learning areas. In this toolbox, practical tips and tricks for local and regional institutions for realising learning areas will be given. \r\nFinally, another important part of the PAC project is the strategic influence on local, regional, national and European policy makers in order to facilitate future learning areas in order to increase the participation possibilities and chances of prisoners.
