Yet, by so doing\u2014intentionally or otherwise\u2014they also contribute to the making of a European people. This, at least, is the central thesis of ARITHMUS. While typically framed as a methodological or statistical problem, the project approaches this as a practical and political problem of assembling multiple national populations into a European population and people.\n\nWhy is this both an urgent political and practical problem? Politically, Europe is said to be unable to address itself to a constituted polity and people, which is crucial to European integration. Practically, its efforts to constitute a European population are also being challenged by digital technologies, which are being used to diversify census methods and bringing into question the comparability of national population data. Consequently, over the next several years Eurostat and national statistical institutes are negotiating regulations for the 2020 census round towards ensuring 'Europe-wide comparability.'\n\nARITHMUS will follow this process and investigate the practices of statisticians as they juggle scientific independence, national autonomy and EU comparability to innovate census methods. It will then connect this practical work to political questions of the making and governing of a European people and polity. It will do so by going beyond state-of-the art scholarship on methods, politics and science and technology studies. Five case studies involving discourse analysis and ethnographic methods will investigate the situated practices of EU and national statisticians as they remake census methods, arguably the most fundamental changes since modern censuses were launched over two centuries ago.

Often, when produced by people, such artefacts embed a fictional idea invented by the creator. For instance, an artist might have the fictional idea: [What if there was a quiz show, where each week someone was shot dead?] and express this through a painting, poem or film. While such ideation is clearly central to creativity, with obvious applications to the creative industries, there have only been a few small, ad-hoc studies of how to automate fictional ideation. The time is therefore ripe to see whether we can derive, implement and test novel formalisms and processes which enable software to not only invent, but assess, explore and present such ideas. We propose to investigate the following model for creative idea generation: (a) collect and analyse some information about a domain, to form a shallow world view of that domain (b) form a set of what-if style ideas from the analysis using notions of surprise, semantic tension and incongruity (c) assess, rank and select ideas based on the quality and quantity of narratives that can be generated using each idea, and (d) use the world view, idea and narratives in linguistic renderings, taking into account notions of relevancy, expansion, obfuscation and affect.

Building on biographical interviews with children, relational and geographical mapping techniques, selective participant-observation with children, and children social research workshops in three cities (London, Athens, Mumbai), the project examines the meaning of personal and social change in middle childhood (6-11 year olds), the circuits of social action that children tap into in an attempt to make changes real, the extent to which privilege, marginalization and economic crisis shape children\u2019s practices of participation, and the ways in which encounters with difference (gender, ethnicity, race, religion) challenge children\u2019s orientation towards social action. By sampling children from a diverse cross-section of each city the project will collect and follow a total of 100 children over a five-year period. The project will provide a rich data sources for making within and between country comparisons and in doing so enable the development a theoretical paradigm for understanding children\u2019s participation that is derived from the bottom-up, that is generated in diverse settings, including non-Western, and that takes advantage of the current rupture to established socio-economic realities to ask questions about the future of social action.", 355126.0, 1205039.0, "CONNECTORS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.goldsmiths.ac.uk", null, "fp7_185372_999882791"], ["6NW", "Transitional Justice Mapping", "Goldsmiths' College", "In 2009, under the auspices of the ERC, a four year programme of research was launched to look at the legal shaping of memry after two apposite conflicts, both of which were marked by mass atrocity.

Over 30% of the pupils have special educational needs and/or social , emotional and mental health needs. \r\nOFSTED rate our school as 'good' with outstanding leadership. Our areas for improvement are to raise attainment at key-stage 1 and to accelerate the progress of our higher attaining pupils.\r\nWe believe that this can be achieved by offering our children a broad and balanced curriculum in addition to the explicit teaching of English and Maths. We also believe that the early years of a child's education are the foundation for further learning and must be of the highest quality. \r\nWe have a large staff of approximately 70  and strong leadership at all levels. Therefore we have the capacity to focus on 3 main areas of school improvement over the next 2 years.\r\nAs part of our school improvement plan we intend to send 6 key staff to Sweden to look at Early Years and Leadership. The staff include the Deputy Head Teacher,  the current EYFS Leader who is an experienced, outstanding practitioner and an aspiring leader in the 4th year of her career. We believe that the staff will bring back new ideas and approaches which will help us to build on the already outstanding practice in the Early Years. Our Early Years staff work closely with other Early Years providers and therefore they will also influence the practice in these other settings.\r\nAs part of our school improvement plan we have appointed a Leader for Outdoor Learning. This is particularly important for our children as many of them live in overcrowded flats with no immediate access to the outside. We already make good use of our playground and we offer many outdoor school trips, which provide memorable educational experiences for our children. We plan to send our Outdoor Learning Leader and a working party of 9 other class teachers/teaching assistants to Latvia to learn about their approach to outdoor learning. We believe that this will give us fresh ideas to bring to the curriculum at Childeric which will motivate and inspire our pupils.\r\nAs part of our school improvement plan we intend to send 6 staff to Gran Canaria for one week language training. We believe that increasing their own proficiency in Spanish and learning more about the methodology of teaching Spanish, as well as the contact with Spanish teachers and cultural immersion, will give our teachers increased confidence and skills to teach our pupils more effectively.

Furthermore, students\u2019 interactions with artists\u2019 processes offer a creative space for exploration with media and techniques, ideas, concepts and issues. \r\n\r\nThe proposed CREARTE project focuses on the establishment of creative partnerships between primary schools and visual artists in the framework of visual arts education. It draws upon the priority areas of the ET 2020 process and the target for reducing school drop-out rates, offering an alternative literacy for children of the age of 6-12 to get involved in experiential and cooperative learning by working with visual artists that could act, in this way, as significant role models to inspire creativity. Children's experiences from such cooperations could be transformative, leading also to the ET 2020 objectives for \"improving the quality and efficiency of education and training\" and \"enhancing creativity and innovation\". CREARTE also aims to meet the priority of strengthening the profile, leadership and research role of the teaching professions by providing teachers with new methods, tools and resources so as to design collaborative projects that meet the needs of their students. Additionally the project aims to strengthen education and training paths of educators by delivering high quality training to in-service teachers and build effective partnerships between training providers (advisors, academics, trainers), educational institutions (pedagogical institutes, universities) and policy makers (inspectors at the Ministry, European Chapter of an international association). The project's direct participants consist of 28 experienced educators from 5 countries (Portugal, Spain, UK, Cyprus, Sweden) that are professionally involved with visual arts education for many years. They teach at various levels (universities, in-service professional development, primary schools) or are policy makers. Most of them have participated in EU projects in the past, are involved in academic writing and curriculum development, and belong to visual arts organisations. A number of them hold doctorate degrees and some are visual artists as well. \r\n\r\nAs a number of EU visual arts curricula encourage cooperations with visual artists, CREARTE suggests the development of a European network of professionals that will facilitate the construction of partnerships between primary schools and visual artists' communities. To achieve this, it is proposed to establish a network that will:\r\n- develop communication channels and foster professional enhancement for the design and exchange of good practices that involve primary school partnerships with visual artists\r\n- establish cooperation between educators, students and visual artists through the development and implementation of school programmes in the framework of visual arts education\r\n- develop OER produced during and after the conclusion of the project\r\n- design an online artists\u2019 database that will serve as a resource and contact point for schools and artists seeking cooperation across Europe\r\n- design a professional development course that will be offered through Key Action 1.\r\n\r\nCREARTE targets to primary school teachers of the involved countries, as well as teachers of the rest of Europe and the world. The project initiates with the review of existing practices regarding school partnerships with visual artists, and utilise staff expertise for the development of the training events for the 28 participants; it evolves with the training of 120 primary educators at the partner countries as well as the development of the OER platform that will incorporate educational materials; it continues with local school implementations by the trained educators with the involvement of visual artists; it progresses with 3 multiplier events for 240 primary educators at the partner countries; it parallel develops an online artists\u2019 database as a tool for bringing together artists and primary schools; it develops an online academic publication; it fosters the design of a short course that will carry on the project outcomes; it ensures quality control by several assessment strategies and milestone check-ups.\r\n\r\nThe activities that are planned to be maintained after the end of the EU funding include the implementation of new local training activities; the maintenance and dissemination of the OER platform and artists\u2019 database; the dissemination of the online academic publication; the offering of a KA1 short course.

In recent years, as traditional social structures have weakened, the role of the school has become even more relevant in this respect.  Developing the 'whole child' has become more important than the traditional focus on  delivering a narrow curriculum of pure, academic subjects.  Meanwhile, concern about the health and well-being of Europe's citizens is growing as economists note the financial implications of an increasingly less active, less healthy, longer living population.  Our 'obesity crisis' is repeatedly referenced as a future economic risk to European success.  \r\n\r\nBringing together these 2 issues is the focus of our project.  How can educators develop the traditional role of schools to focus more firmly on Health and Well - Being and ensure we foster positive, 'inclusive' experiences of physical education and healthy eating?  How can schools encourage positive attitudes in all pupils and set them on a path to fitness for life and a healthier, more productive future?  \r\n\r\nThe task begins with up-skilling current and future teachers to lead the attitudinal change we require from all educational sectors.  This project seeks to do that by bringing together a number of high achieving schools, aware of this need to 'educate for life', as well as Universities with a Teacher Training remit--including a focus on training Physical Education teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership consists primarily of a University and 2 schools in each of three countries--the UK,  Spain and Greece.  (An additional partner of a University based fitness facility adds additional expertise and resources to complement the other UK partners and  bring the total number in the partnership to 10.)  \r\n\r\nThe group have agreed a 2 year work-plan of collaboration in order to exchange knowledge, bring more focus to the Pupil Health & Well - Being agenda and develop joint resources.   4  joint,  transnational meetings  and a program of on-going  local activities to strengthen education are planned.  Joint activities between the schools and Universities involved will be supported.  \r\n\r\nOngoing research, knowledge sharing, the development of resources and dissemination & evaluation will all take place as the partnership work together to develop 6 training modules, which the 3 University partners have agreed to incorporate into their future teacher training.  The modules will focus on teaching and learning styles, behavioral change, cultural influence and inclusion in schools, as well as more traditional aspects of physical education.  They will also form the foundation of our final year training event  following our last transnational meeting\u2014a trial run for an ongoing in-service course offer for school staff across Europe, to be offered year on year following the project's end.  This annual course will be advertised on the EU Erasmus + Key Action 1 course database and be self-funding, with each of the 3 countries involved hosting it in turn and with a transnational partnership cohort delivering.  \r\n\r\nAll lesson plans and resources produced by the project will be offered free to those who take part, as well as generally via the project web site, which will be funded to continue for a minimum of 5 additional years.\r\n\r\nThe schools involved are high achieving and focused on 'education for life'. Many of them succeed in areas with high levels of deprivation.  The Universities are all long standing trainers of future teachers with different approaches to the tutoring of general teachers as well as specifically to the development of future Physical Education teachers.  We want to combine these approaches to develop the most coherent training possible for current and future teachers, allowing them to begin the process of expanding the remit of their teaching and their schools to focus more effectively on establishing healthy patterns of living.  This will initially be within the organizations in the partnership, but over the life of this project, should spread locally via local dissemination activities and finally, across a wider European area as the end products are disseminated via our ongoing delivery of our  European in-service course for school staff.  \r\n\r\nMethodology  will be scientific and rigorously tested.

Despite the great potential of creative and cultural enterprises, some 900.000 in Europe that, according to the EU Commission, total 3 % of the overall European GIP (402 billion of Euros) and a relevant quota of jobs, those enterprises are widely undervalued. So, not only do they need support to the entrepreneurial component, but also the establishment of stronger relations with assets of consolidated manufacture.\r\nThe Smart Jump project intends to strengthen the links between training and labour environments, through the improvement of training offer (with the reduction of gaps of specific skills for entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship) and the support to the governance systems referring to education and training. These systems are nowadays ruled through interactions that are more and more complex, between training organisations, companies, policy makers, decision makers and society as such. More in detail, this proposal intends to strengthen the quality of learning offer linked to the entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship of women and young entrepreneurs who are active or have entered the creative industries sector. The starting point is a model - in this case developed in Sweden with the Women Resource Center - called Four Helix, that aims at developing female entrepreneurship through joint actions of Institutions, of companies, of university and society. Smart Jump will concretely operate to fine tune the training offer at local level and at partners\u2019 level with the strategies of economical development directed to growth and innovation. The project envisages the realisation of different activities and results, of sharing the Swedish practice, of joint development of training contents for female and young entrepreneurs, of transnational actions (mobility and training), of design of a community including entrepreneurs and professionals to dialogue with the Public, university and society. The strategic partnership is made of 7 partners from 5 EU Member states. It encompasses public bodies (such as the Veneto Region) and private organisations (such as Confindustria Veneto SIAV, WINNET) representative of enterprises, university (such as CUOA Foundation and Goldsmiths\u2019 College) and development of human capital.\r\nMain beneficiaries involved in the Smart Jump project are women and young persons who operate (or intend to operate) in the creative industries sector. On one side, female entrepreneurs or women who act as managers in Europe are less than 30 % and have limited access to high level interventions of managerial training. On the other side, the support to entrepreneurship, especially in emerging sectors and with high rate of development has been recognised as one of the possible answers to the dramatic situation of youth unemployment, particularly in Spain, Italy, and Hungary. As a consequence, 52 beneficiaries (women, young, staff of partners\u2019 organisations) will be directly involved in the testing phase of the learning model.\r\nThe work plan is articulated in three macro activities: a first step will deal with the analysis of the Swedish approach in order to design the structure of the cooperation model between actors. The analysis will integrate also existing practices in partner countries, and will set the training contents for entrepreneurial development. The second phase envisages the promotion of creativity, of learning to innovate, of entrepreneurship. The third step is about valorization and mainstreaming and the design of an international community to network stakeholders related to creative industries.\r\nIn terms of benefits and impact, the project will improve the training offer of partner organisations. It will develop high level skills to support entrepreneurial activity, and will support the organisation linked to the industrial systems.

Putting entrepreneurial skills into practice- for example network building, fundraising, creating new ways to involve the public - is becoming increasingly important as a way to stay healthy. However, this cannot go against other core tasks like conservation; this  should go hand in hand. Hence the concept of \"cultural entrepreneurship\". \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThere is a distinct need of obtaining more cultural entrepreneurship skills in the sector and putting them into practice. Although training courses aimed at the heritage and museum sectors exist in most EU member states, their availability, take-up and accreditation is not widely spread. This project aims at giving cultural heritage organizations and museums possibilities to acquire competences and tools in the field of cultural entrepreneurship. \r\n \r\nThe specific objectives are:\r\n- to define the cultural entrepreneurship concept, contributing to the mutual understanding and recognition;\r\n- to research the topic of cultural entrepreneurship in the member states and in the European context, and build a long-lasting strategic partnership of key education and sector organizations around a common research agenda,\r\n- to contribute to the 'cultural entrepreneur' curriculum by agreeing on the specific elements / skills necessary and effective ways to obtain these skills; using innovative techniques within current established fields;\r\n-- to develop a cultural entrepreneurship VET training course pilot specifically aimed at staff of smaller museums and cultural heritage organizations, experiment with it in the field;\r\n- to exploit the training course and the project results, within the parter organizations, but also Europe-wide by means of the creation of a cultural entrepreneurship online platform and community that will live on after the project.\r\n\r\nPartnership\r\nThe partnership base is three higher education institutions that are experts in the field of culture, management and entrepreneurship, the Amsterdam School of the Arts, University of London and University of Bologna.

The separation between Anglophone and Francophone literatures, and between classical and contemporary literary and cultural studies are examples of how connections can be lost.  \u2018Mediterranean Imaginaries: Literature, Arts, Culture\u2019 presents the particular space of this sea as an area of study, thereby providing a platform where scholars with different specialisations can meet.  The Intensive Study Programme (ISP) is highly innovative in studying not only how literature and other art forms are produced in the Mediterranean, but also how the Mediterranean has been represented and \u201cproduced\u201d by other \u201cNorth European\u201d cultures, historically and more recently. The ISP takes account of very recent literature and films that feature current forms of migration as well as developments on the Southern Mediterranean shores (the so-called \u201cArab spring\u201d and the recent waves of migration ), and their representation. The two week ISP  features lectures given by specialists in the field and these are followed by all the students. While attending all the lectures and their discussion, the specialist workshops,  organised in two series co-ordinated by the academic advisers to the project, allow students to choose between the two different workshop series, so that  students can achieve more focused specialisation on particular areas of the curriculum. Seminar A concentrates  on classical representations of the Mediterranean while Seminar B has a more contemporary focus. The students all attend a number of joint seminars (A+B) that allow them to share learning and research. Students from Malta, Goldsmiths, Nova Gorica, Minho, Cagliari, Florence and Carthage will benefit from the large pool of experts lecturing in the Intensive Study Programme. Students will achieve knowledge of a range of texts and films representing aspects of the Mediterranean, they will learn to identify literature and cultures from different periods and different areas, as well as influences between texts. Students will study how different works construct Mediterranean culture, history  or geography, how cultural encounters, clashes or exchanges are represented in various texts, and how these, in turn, impact on their national literatures.The syllabus of \u2018Mediterranean Imaginaries: Literature, Arts, Culture\u2019  enables students who are at a distance from the Mediterranean sea to study literature and culture from this region. The topic will draw scholars and students working in comparative, Anglophone and Francophone literary studies as well as others from disciplines such as history , cultural studies, film studies, visual arts, and philosophy, thus presenting a strong multidisciplinary approach. Through the ISP,  important cross-cultural perspectives and opinions will be shared amongst participants and students. This would not be possible if the module was run separately at the 7 universities. The follow-up events  - the post-graduate conferences organized by the UOM's Department of English - at the end of the ISP in  2017 and 2018  give opportunities to all the students to present their collaborative work to a wider audience. As these conferences will also include  literature culture related to the Mediterranean, the students extend their knowledge of  these subjects even further. The follow-up events in London in June 2017 and 2018 again call for collaborative work from all the students. The work will be presented by 4 of the Maltese students and by the 6  Goldsmiths students who have attended the ISP at the conference of the London Intercollegiate Network for Comparative Studies or of the Goldsmiths Literature Seminar. As the Maltese students do not benefit from mobility for the ISP,  it is appropriate that they should have the opportunity to go to London to work in a different academic environment.The Strategic Partnership as a whole widens the horizons of the students and academics taking part and makes them more aware of the wealth of knowledge on Mediterranean affairs harboured in 6 European and 1 North African university. This will enhance the international competitiveness of the participating universities. Students will also become more conscious of the practical ways in which literature can influence society, for example,   by addressing issues related to migration, racism and xenophobia in the Mediterranean and beyond, thus  enhancing their value as European citizens,  and increasing their employability.

By creating a transnational strategic partnership, built on different contexts and experiences across Europe, it will create a framework for the exchange of ideas and approaches and develop a Toolkit of resources for speculative design education. In the context of rapidly shifting social, technological, media and economic conditions an increasing number of designers are developing new approaches to design. These \u201cnew designers\u201d act on the borders of traditionally defined disciplines, blurring the distinctions between them. In their research, these new designers engage with diverse fields of science, primarily computer sciences and engineering, sociology, psychology, architecture, biotechnology, nanotechnology, etc., with the goal of critically reflecting on the development and role of technology in society. \r\nSpeculative design is the most significant example of these new design practices focused on \u201cproblem finding\u201d rather than \u201cproblem solving\u201d. It is a discursive practice, based on critical thinking and dialogue, which questions the practice of design. However, a speculative design approach takes critical practice one step further; towards new future imaginaries or alternative possible trajectories. Through a range of speculative methods, designers re-think alternative products, systems and worlds. Through its imagination and radical approach, speculative design forces one to think \u2013 raises awareness, provokes action, initiates discussions and perhaps even offers some alternatives that are essential for the world of today, and more importantly, the world of tomorrow.\r\nMain target audiences are educational institutions and PhD and master students (also bachelor) which are interested in investigating relationships between people, society and technology. However, speculative practice has a broader reach and influence. Namely, speculative design could be seen as a tool for society related practices which are important in raising awareness, initiating discussions but also taking actions, outside exclusively design context. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in speculative approaches within the wider design community that reveals the need for new designers in the industrial sector, i.e., in companies employing designers to consider scenarios for future trends and research into the adoption of emerging technologies.\r\nAlthough there are existing speculative design educational programs, regular educational practice is often slow to embrace new approaches and methodologies. There is a need for stronger institutional collaboration in strengthening these novel design educational approaches outside the regular curriculum (educational process). Multinational, multi-partner collaboration offers great context for developing, testing and disseminating novel educational content. In the regular teaching process, there is not often a chance to test new ideas and tools within an intensive context. From educational practice we experience an urgent need for a collection of resources related to this approach, accompanied by further reflective analysis and development. These resources, systematically structured and disseminated, could offer students new design skills for the 21st century, reflexive and critical toward their own practice in order to go beyond the limits of design definitions and to re-think the role of design and designers in today's society.\r\nThe main objectives of this project are:\r\n- to collect, exchange, reflect upon, develop and advance educational practice in the area of speculative design;\r\n- to create new (and strengthen existing) partnerships in the field of speculative design education with particular emphasis on forging interactions between designers and experts from other related disciplines;\r\n- to support and consolidate speculative design education;\r\n- to promote speculative design as educational approach and mode of critical thinking (to academic and broader audience outside design context).\r\nProject will organise these three events:\r\n- open discussion with experts (multiplier event);\r\n- international students workshop (multiplier event);\r\n- symposium (multiplier event with exhibition and final dissemination workshop).\r\nProject is going to produce three outcomes:\r\n- State of the Speculative Design Study: study will describe the current landscape of speculative design and related design practices at the European level - collection of best practices and case-studies;\r\n- Speculative Design Textbook: textbook for students but also practitioners, based on the Outcome 1 and reflections/evaluations from the discussion and the workshop.\r\n- Speculative Design Open Toolkit: open access online repository based on the Outcome 1 and 2 \u2014 to be freely used and maintained by the speculative design communities and networks.", "http://www.gold.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HR01-KA203-047427_1"], ["6NW", "CONNECTING AUDIENCES European Alliance for Education and Training in Audience Development", "GOLDSMITHS' COLLEGE", 811740.0, "CONNECT is a Knowledge Alliance that promotes innovative cooperation between universities and enterprises in the cultural sector across Europe.During the project a new Twin-track programme in audience development for students and practitioners working in arts management will be designed and launched by a transnational team of 54 researchers, teachers and trainers in 5 national hubs in Spain, UK, Italy, Denmark and Poland, each one composed by higher education institutions and private cultural organisations.
