The Mathilde-Weber Vocational College in T\u00fcbingen promotes the said project and has been engaged in annually implementing occupational mobility since 2003. The aim is to improve the quality of early childhood education and care through gaining insight into settings in other countries.  The promotion of social  skills and competence is a key subject in educational work with children. The project theme is put into practice  through observation within the allocated setting, conversation and discussion with the trained staff there and  activities specifically designed to promote social skills in those taking part.

Immersion in a foreign cultural environment  strengthens the receptiveness for new things and tolerance of anything different. Personal experience of being foreign makes the participant more sensitive to children and families with a history of migration and qualifies him or her for educational work within a diversely ethnic society. \r\nImproved language skills and an understanding of educational settings in other European countries encourage European thought and strengthen solidarity within Europe. \r\n \r\nThe comparison of individual experiences gained within diverse settings in different countries leads to a recognition of  and reflection on differences and similarities; personal attitude is  examined and the approach to the profession strengthened. \r\nParticipants are prepared for their work placement abroad over a one-year period.
