Conceptually, the Reasoning Workspace comprises three areas: (i) a Data Space which will enable an analyst to see what data and themes exist, (ii) an Analysis Space to which data can be brought into to carry out various computational analyses including statistical and text analysis, and (iii) a Hypothesis Space that will enable the analysts to assemble their evidence into coherent arguments that lead to meaningful and valid conclusions.\n\nThe user interface will be rooted in the concepts of Visual Analytics \u2013 the emerging \u201c\u2026 science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces' (Thomas and Cook, 2004), and specially designed to support the interactive dynamics (Heer and Shneiderman, 2012) required to enable real-time analytic interaction with data. The design of the user interface will move away from the traditional windows and list of lists views for presenting data, and instead to create information objects that may be directly manipulated and freely organised visuo-spatially by the analysts so that location and spatial groupings have meaning and can be manipulated directly by selection and dragging; or we can initiate Boolean operations on the content of the two or more clusters by dragging one cluster onto another. In addition, the presentation of multiple views of the information objects, in the form of network graphs, timelines, geo-spatial etc. can lead to further insight, especially when interactivity is enabled. This tight coupling between visualisation and computation is crucial for developing and maintaining cognitive momentum, the train of thought that enables creativity and sense-making.'", 662233.0, 13449145.0, "VALCRI", null, null, null, null, "http://www.a-esolutions.com", null, "fp7_188614_992464037"], ["7AA", "CRitical Incident management training System using an Interactive Simulation environment", "A E Solutions (Bi) Limited", "CRISIS is a 42 month project to research and develop an advanced critical incident management, interactive simulation environment for training security and emergency personnel in airport operational security. The prototype to be delivered will be distributed, scalable, collaborative interactive simulation environment that will enable training of crisis managers and their staff at airports, at different levels of the organization. The prototype system will avoid the simulation paradigm where the trainee selects one of a number of pre-set drill oriented choices at a predictable decision point. Instead, using an interactive games paradigm, the trainees will be able to practice situation and cue assessment, problem diagnosis, decision making and action coordination, in real-time in response to a critical incident. Currently, one key problem hindering the maintenance of a high level of preparedness in operational security organizations at airports is the long 2-year wait between major exercises. In CRISIS, we will enable organizations and individuals to train-on-demand, and as frequently as needed due to the innovations, such as end-user re-configurability of training scenarios. This will allow staff to train individually &apos;playing&apos; against the system, as a team within an organization, across organizations, and at different levels of the command hierarchy.

The EU-funded project 'Critical incident management training system using an interactive simulation environment' (http://www.crisis-project.eu (CRISIS)) worked on a cutting-edge critical incident management solution to train security and emergency personnel in airports.\n\nProject members examined how existing training procedures and systems can be modified to benefit from the new interactive training environment and to deal with identified training gaps. It developed a prototype of an interactive simulation environment that trains crisis managers and relevant staff at different levels of the organisation, avoiding predictable simulation exercises with pre-set drill-oriented choices.\n\nThe project created a train-on-demand security solution by developing software to simulate complex group behaviours in exercise scenarios and integrating related technologies to allow for robust functionality. It conducted field studies in collaboration with police officers and firefighters, as well as live exercises in Iceland, Portugal and the United Kingdom.\n\nWork also involved research into advanced decision technologies, creating sophisticated exercise templates and enabling exercise planners to configure sophisticated scenarios and situations for training.\n\nCRISIS members developed reconfigurable tools to accommodate particular situations and different environments, and also to scale up or down for small and large airport scenarios.\n\nThe system will be able to automatically update the instructor on trainee performance in real-time. It will also feature a mobile or tablet application that can be used by instructors to monitor performance.\n\nExtensive analysis and testing was carried out to assess the system's usability and training effectiveness.\n\nThanks to CRISIS, first responders and crisis managers from around the world can take part in crisis management simulation training to enhance their readiness and preparedness skills.

The best place to spread and bring into force this idea and the recommendations of the UN must be schools, because education and children are the best way to change the world. We will join a trend - the school and local agenda 21 movement- that have been put into practice in some regions all around the world.\r\nThe \u201cAgenda 21\u201d is a concept created by the United Nations in the 1990\u00b4s with the slogan -\u201cthink globally and act locally\u201d. This idea tries to promote sustainable development and environmental protection in our town council, in our region and in our school. Each institution should have an \u201cAgenda 21\u201d to protect environment in a small scale. The European Union has signed recently (March 2013) an agreement in which it is shown the desire to enlarge the awareness of this idea and philosophy.  \r\nOur task or objective is to create a conscience at both local and school level by implementing a final document of AGENDA 21 for our schools. This document will be a model for other schools and  a turning point  in the awarenes and active participation in  the schools and local communities. The document will be included as a formal and official document in all our schools and it will be integrated with other existing normative, guidelines and rules. All the members of the strategic partnership will join the national ECO-SCHOOL association (some of them already belong to them) and   we will   carry out different and practical activities related to the items or issues that eco-schools work with: WASTE, LITTER, WATER, ENERGY, BIODIVERSITY, TRANSPORT,  SCHOOL GROUNDS, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AND  SUSTANING OUR WORLD.
