The cameras will be located on one or more sites, and the monitoring/control room will be on a separate site. The main benefit of this distribution is that it will enable\n\u2022 increasing the efficiency for producing live Broadcast content by a factor of 2-3, by sending only camera personnel to remote sites, and having the main production team in the home studio to do several programs in a single day.\n\u2022 integrating high-quality and high-resolution (HD and higher) image sensors in a networked infrastructure to detect, recognize and identify Surveillance and Security issues when observing long distance or large-scale events.\nTo achieve this objective, innovations will be required in 7 technology domains. These innovations will be achieved by close cooperation of the whole consortium. Two demonstrators, to which all partners will contribute, will be presented at the end of the project as proof of concept. Intermediate and incremental demonstrators will be tested in order to reduce the risk in the project. \n\nThe BASTION project is based on an excellent consortium, divided over 4 countries (B, F, NL, and UK), containing 5 SMEs (Axon, Adimec, Grass Valley, Caeleste, and Camargus), 2 research institute (iMinds and Armines), 3 semiconductor companies (Altera, Caeleste and e2v) and 2 end users (Sagem and Videohouse). The prime partner Axon is an SME. \n \nThe innovate work performed in BASTION is relevant to 4 of the Grand Challenges as proposed in the Annual Working Plan (AWP) 2013.", 225797.0, 9192674.0, "BASTION", null, null, null, null, "http://www.altera.com", null, "fp7_201981_950338101"], ["4JD", "High-frequency ELectro-Magnetic technologies for advanced processing of ceramic matrix composites and graphite expansion", "Archer Technicoat Limited", "'Lightweight ceramics and fibre reinforced ceramic composites, such as non-oxide Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) and Expanded Graphite (EG),  represent very promising solutions for high temperature applications in strategic industrial sectors, such as transport and energy. In fact, these materials are one of topical priorities of the European Technology Platform EuMAT and a strategic issue of the EC Research Roadmap on Materials.\nHuge market opportunities are expected for CMC and EG provided to overcome the three major identified gaps: high cost, difficulty of processing and materials reliability. New and more efficient manufacturing technologies can pave the way to improve material quality, reduce processing time, converge towards near-net shape fabrication, trim energy spent and abate production costs.\nHELM will address these challenges by proposing innovative high-frequency electromagnetic, microwaves (MW) and radiofrequencies (RF), heating technologies for integrating and, in the long term, replacing standard thermal processing routes, i.e.: Chemical Vapour Infiltration (CVI), Liquid Silicon Infiltration (LSI), Polymer Impregnation and Pyrolysis (PIP), and Graphite Exfoliation (GE).\nMW/RF heating owns peculiar features (rapid selective bulk heating, reversed thermal gradients, more homogeneous heat distribution) that will enhance materials performance. It can bring 60% processing time reduction (or even higher), with subsequent trimming of production costs, and cut of energy consumption up to 50-60%.\nHELM RTD activities involve some of the principal European experts in the field, including research institutes, innovative SMEs,  and end-users for industrial validation. A full product assessment, including energy and cost evaluations, will be performed through proper Life Cycle Assessment and thermo-economical analysis.

Novel microwave (MW) heating will cut processing times and energy consumption to enhance market uptake.", "CMCs have already been used in demanding high-temperature space applications, and the manufacturing, transport and energy sectors are obvious potential beneficiaries. However, these advanced materials are currently difficult and expensive to produce, requiring long processing times and high energy consumption.\n\nOvercoming these challenges to open the door to new materials technologies is the impetus behind the EU-funded project http://www.helm-project.eu/ (HELM). Scientists are investigating innovative MW heating technologies to be integrated with standard thermal processing routes in the short-term and eventually replace them in the long-term.\n\nThey promise to reduce processing time by 60\u00a0% or more and energy consumption by 50\u201360\u00a0% for concurrent reductions in costs. The conventional routes under investigation are chemical vapour infiltration (CVI), liquid silicon infiltration (LSI), graphite expansion (GE), and polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP).\n\nAn MW-CVI furnace is being produced entirely of graphite for the first time to avoid contamination of the material produced. Models have facilitated careful characterisation of thermal and electromagnetic behaviour of the furnace regarding its graphite walls, and the pilot-scale furnace is now nearing completion.\n\nTests on an existing small lab-scale MW-LSI furnace produced very promising results. Liquefaction of silicon occurred in only a few minutes compared to several hours for a conventional industrial furnace. A larger lab-scale system and a pilot-scale system are currently under construction for further testing and optimisation. The MW-GE process was also shown to be very rapid and effective. A pilot-scale furnace is currently under development in collaboration among industrial partners.\n\nBuilding on success with the MW-CVI furnace chamber that does not utilise quartz, MW heating of the PIP process will be done without a quartz cavity. Simulations facilitated a design capable of achieving a uniform MW field.\n\nHELM scientists are well on their way to delivering novel MW heating technology that will significantly reduce processing time and energy consumption compared to standard thermal processes alone. The processing will facilitate more cost-effective and high-quality CMCs and EG, enabling achievement of new microstructures currently not accessible with conventional technology.

The continuous metallic skeleton serves as efficient tool against crack propagation, thus improving toughness of material at both high and low temperatures. The volume content of silicides will gradiently increase from the refractory core, forming continuous skin at the surface.
