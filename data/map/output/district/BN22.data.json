It is also essential that the students realize the benefits of gaining work experience abroad. They will be discovering and analysing a new culture through immersion and a quality support program and encountering local young people through European partners which will help them acquire intercultural experience and behaviour essential to their ultimate satisfaction. They need to master behaviour codes and language registers as well gain self-confidence in the work environment. The various beneficial professional, linguistic, cultural, professional, and personal factors make this an enriching experience that reinforces their skills and ensures their professional success. After two successful projects (2013-2014 and 2015/2017), the program would like to lean away from expertise to focus more on exchanges and European mobility in order to portray an attractive and enriching experience while using an international approach in teaching and educational practices.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 13 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organisations in different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 250 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. \r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ Mobility Charter acquired in 2015 as well as the active partnership of many public authorities should help to enlarge our partnership networks to other teaching organisations or local authorities.

This is a continuation of the development of the action plan that the international mobility service today offers its services and collaboration in the implementation of this action in the service of the 155 Local Missions (4489 employees). \r\nTo meet the different needs identified among professionals, the international mobility department wants to develop a training course of a week abroad that combines two aspects; language instruction and participation in professional development activities to meet four objectives: \r\n- European dimension: broaden its vision and professional practices: \r\nTraining abroad is an enriching and educational experience for the participants themselves, but not only. Indeed, professional practices of the participants are diversified and enriched by best practices and know-how developed abroad. On a more global level, the confrontation with new approaches and methodologies in an unfamiliar professional context facilitates questioning practices and promotes a fresh look at their craft. \r\n- the development of language skills: \r\nInsufficient language skills, real or perceived, deters many personnel from abroad. This apprehension is particularly developed among employees who have less systematically used to practice a foreign language in their professional environment. It is therefore desecrated learning foreign languages so that it is not an end in itself but just a vector in the service of access to the culture they carry. Learning foreign languages can not be confined to merely transmitting linguistic knowledge, but must be complemented by experience and cultural knowledge. It is in this light that the Consortium in collaboration with partners ensures the implementation of language courses integrating a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, language training based on the daily realities). \r\n- Developers of the network of mobility: \r\nMobility is rarely considered a professionalizing experience of strategic objectives service. A variety of means is available yet to value the developers of mobility and action: There is no doubt that it is on the implementation of youth mobility as the impact of personal mobility is most visible. Indeed, participants employees are better equipped to advise young people who want to go on the move Thanks to the time spent in a foreign country (language school, cross-cultural experience, meet different partners (job center, youth hostel. ..)), professionals are more familiar with the specifics and partners can refer finer young people to the most relevant foreign devices and programs. \r\nThus, the training of professional social integration networks can meet the following innovations: \r\n- to optimize answers for young people: \r\nThe Consortium has always had in mind the need to better tailor benefits for different categories of audiences, but this objective to be achieved requires to implement actions to support mobilized for employment counsellors and social and professional integration. These guidelines form the basis of an intervention that in the adaptation perspective and improves the quality of service for the public in search of a job. \r\n- a better understanding of transnational mobility actions to provide more opportunities for access to quality training at any time of life they accompany the public in order to promote their personal and professional development in the idea of \"Work First \" \r\n- Encouraging adaptation to the needs of the territories through a local presence strengthened AMILAURA services, with the development of employment opportunities, notably in the transnational space, by supporting geographic mobility. \r\n- Enhance the quality of service provision for young people and contribute to improving the transparency of the supply of services linked to mobility \r\n- The professionalization of counsellors so that they can cope with a wide range of situations.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of  participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 8 experienced intermediary organizations in 8 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 150 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. The Region itself is also an active partner in the project: its involvement since our foundation, \u201cguarantees\u201d the quality of our services and will help us to enlarge still further our partnership networks to other teaching organizations or local authorities.

However, it suffers from difficulties to integrate in the local companies a significant portion of its population:  younger, less graduated and overall more impacted by unemployment than the average Paris suburb population. The major challenge is therefore to facilitate to this local population the access to the jobs opportunities generated by this dynamic labor pool.Studies managed by the \u201cGIP Emploi Roissy\u201d and its partners have identified 4 structuring professional sectors able to generate jobs: logistics & transport, tourism related to business trips, international business and airport services. For these sectors, jobs related to customer interaction are highly important and able to generate professional opportunitiesIn order to get access to these jobs, due to the international context of this area, it requires foreign languages knowledges and the ability to work in a multicultural environment.To manage this specific challenge, the \u201cGIP Emploi Roissy \u201cis leading a dedicated consortium of 4 structures specialized in supporting Job seekers.

With this in mind, IThe CONSORTIUM offers today its services and collaboration in order to set up this action.\r\nIn order to answer the professionals\u2019 different needs, The CONSORTIUM wishes to develop one-week training abroad  which will involve 2 aspects : some language tuition and some professional activities. This training is set up to achieve 4 objectives:\r\n\r\n- A European dimension in order to widen vision and professional practice :\r\nA training abroad represents a fulfiling experience for the candidates getting involved. Their professional practice will become diversified thanks to what they learned abroad. On a wider point of view, new professional visions and methods will help the candidate to see their career differently.\r\n\r\n- the development of linguistic skills:\r\nA poor linguistic level can put off a lot of people going abroad. This apprehension is particularly developed by professionals who are not used to speak a foreign language at work. Therefore we need to focus on making the learning of foreign languages a way to access to different cultures and to the mobility. Also the learning of languages must be completed  by experiences and cultural knowledges. It is with this in mind that The CONSORTIUM and its partners will set up some linguistic tuition involving a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, training on expressions used on a daily basis).\r\n\r\n- Set up a network of actors engaged in mobility projects:\r\nMobility is not enough considered as a professionalising experience. Many ways are however available to put forward actors promoting the mobility and their action : it is obvious that the impact of the professionals\u2019 mobility will be seen through the mobilities of young people. Indeed, partners getting involved will have a better knowledge to advise young people who wish to go abroad thanks to their own experience in a foreign country (language school, intercultural experiences, meeting with various partners (job center, youth hostels...)) , the professionals will know each partner better and will be able to guide youngsters towards programs that are suitable to their requirements. \r\n\r\nThis way, the training of professionals within the social integration network will answer to the following innovations:\r\n- towards an optimisation of answers for young people:\r\nThe CONSORTIUM has always in mind to adapt its services to its public. But to reach this goal, actions need to be put in place to help advisers but also any actors getting involved in the mobility and in the social and professional integration.

The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, of insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the monitoring and evaluation of the participants.

With this in mind, IPM offers today its services and collaboration in order to set up this action.In order to answer the professionals\u2019 different needs, IPM platform wishes to develop one-week training abroad  which will involve 2 aspects : some language tuition and some professional activities. This training is set up to achieve 4 objectives:- A European dimension in order to widen vision and professional practice :A training abroad represents a fulfiling experience for the candidates getting involved. Their professional practice will become diversified thanks to what they learned abroad. On a wider point of view, new professional visions and methods will help the candidate to see their career differently.- the development of linguistic skills:A poor linguistic level can put off a lot of people going abroad. This apprehension is particularly developed by professionals who are not used to speak a foreign language at work. Therefore we need to focus on making the learning of foreign languages a way to access to different cultures and to the mobility. Also the learning of languages must be completed  by experiences and cultural knowledges. It is with this in mind that IPM and its partners will set up some linguistic tuition involving a multidimensional approach (language, culture, communication, training on expressions used on a daily basis).- Set up a network of actors engaged in mobility projects:Mobility is not enough considered as a professionalising experience. Many ways are however available to put forward actors promoting the mobility and their action : it is obvious that the impact of the professionals\u2019 mobility will be seen through the mobilities of young people. Indeed, partners getting involved will have a better knowledge to advise young people who wish to go abroad thanks to their own experience in a foreign country (language school, intercultural experiences, meeting with various partners (job center, youth hostels...)) , the professionals will know each partner better and will be able to guide youngsters towards programs that are suitable to their requirements. This way, the training of professionals within the social integration network will answer to the following innovations:- towards an optimisation of answers for young people:IPM has always in mind to adapt its services to its public. But to reach this goal, actions need to be put in place to help advisers but also any actors getting involved in the mobility and in the social and professional integration. These actions represent the foundation of an intervention addressed to a public looking for a job, with the perspective of improving the quality of service. - better understanding of the actions of international mobility to offer more access to continued quality training to the public they deal with in order to maximise their personal and profesisonal development within the concept \"work First\"- Maximise the tailoring of the territories\u2019 needs through the strong set up of IPM services, with a development of work opportunities, transnationnally particularly, with the support of geographic mobility.- Stenghten the quality of the services addressed to young people and contribute to improve the transparency of the services related to mobility.- Professionalising advisers so they can face any type of situations.

The applicants are no longer selected to study the BTEC National diploma. They are young, they have a lower educational level and not enough maturity. All this makes it difficult to cope with the mobility program because the adaptability abroad is very poor. The consequences are: difficulties to take part in selling and social activities, to communicate with the staff and customers as well as with the host family due to the very poor English.\r\nThe European section members can change along the three school years. Some of them give up because they are no longer motivated while others decide to join the mobility program after thinking much more about it;  their family's support is a crucial deciding factor because they make them realize the significant opportunity which awaits them.\r\n\r\nThe required activities skills are described in the appendix: being able to sell, be in charge of a product sale and manage the selling space of which they are in charge.\r\n\r\nThe most important objective remains to be able to communicate in English in the sales field.

Good behavior gets better. Immersion in a new environment facilitates the capacity to adapt and encourage them to be mobile.

Indeed, at the origin of our initiative to apply for Leonardo fundings, the section \" Administration\" was the only one to be concerned. Then, gradually, the students having benefited from these work placements in England showed a great interest among the other students from the school. Hence, a great demand from the students from the section MRCU arose to benefit from the work placements abroad in the same way. Therefore, we decided to enlarge our work placement opportunities abroad (to Italy) and to involve students from the section MRCU as well. We are strengthening our partnership with Tempo Libero in Italy in the region of the Garda Lake where the tourist and sales business is thriving. The work placements are therefore suitable for our students from the section MRCU. These 3-week placements will involve 10 students in my 2017, precisely at the beginning of the tourist season. We are maintaining and pursuing the European section \u201cAdministration\u201d and carrying on our collaboration with Breakaway since we are considering to place 8 students in England for a 3-week work experience in 2017.The close ties we have had so far with this partner enable us to be efficient when it comes to the setting up of the mobility abroad. As the years pass, we realize that these work placements abroad have a strong and positive impact on our students: some of them returned to visit their host families during the summer, others had the opportunity to carry out another working period within their company.   Another one enrolled on a Btech HND in International Trade. We also have a former student, now in BTS HND who is applying for a work placement in Great Britain. In September 2016, The team of teachers involved in the project Erasmus has enlarged with the involvement of a new DNL teacher in sales techniques, a math teacher having a good command of Italian and an extensive knowledge of the Italian culture and a native Spanish teacher.Thanks to this new Spanish teacher we will have the opportunity to develop two projects in Spain : -We got in touch with Mrs Marisa Cano, the manager of an association of shopkeepers in Murcia \u00ab Comerciantes Plater\u00eda y Traper\u00eda \u00bb which has close links with the Murcia shopping area MUAC (Murcia \u00e1rea comercial).

This teacher seems to be highly interested to work with us next year in a mutual collaboration on the platform e-tweening. These projects are essential if we want to perpetuate our willingness to With the aim to reach an efficient organization the teachers interact with each other but also specialize in one of the 3 projects (England, Italy and the new emerging one, Spain). It means :- Working closely with the existing partners : Breakaway and Tempo Libero for the preparation of the stays in England and Italy (accommodation , work placements, assessment grids, objectives, Skype discussions )- taking part in the likely creation of a second European section in MRCU (sales techniques and reception skills).- Developing and fostering cultural and language projects within the school inherent to each country- Initiating the two recent projects in Spain (partnership with a high school near Barcelona and cooperation with an association of shopkeepers in Murcia).This collaboration leads to a better anticipation of the mobility which will encourage thestudents' motivation for this experience abroad and will have an incidence on their education as they feel valued.

Allowing them to go abroad for free is a bet on the future of their employability, as hospitality is a sector where mobility is important and where the ability to speak modern languages is paramount, however their social situation does not often offer them the opportunity to be mobile. \r\n \r\nThe link between this Leonardo Da Vinci mobility project and the Jules Le Cesne vocational school\u2019s own project is no less relevant today as, within the context of the contract agreement, tackling early school leaving is the main objective of part of the measures taken and the actions carried out within the establishment.\r\nThere are many specific needs targeted:\r\n1. Optimising the chances of success in the exam by acquiring different work techniques in the professional environment as well as promoting the learning and the use of foreign languages in professional situations.\r\n2. Validating professional techniques by the assessment made through the joint work of the supervisor and the evaluator who fill in/expand on the work experience booklet when evaluating it at the end of the placement. \r\n3.

Due to the reform of the BTEC National diploma which has reduced schooling to a three year course, the applicants are now younger, sometimes did not pass the BTEC first diploma and are no longer selected to study the BTEC National Diploma. This lack of maturity and the lower educational level make it difficult to select the students because of their incapacity to adapt abroad. Students find it hard to live with a host family. The lack of professional knowledge may also create disagreements during the training placement, such as :\r\n- Incapacity to take part in selling and social activities.\r\n- Difficulty communicating with the staff and customers.\r\n- Refusal to speak English. \r\nThe European section members can change during the three school years; some of them give up, some are no longer motivated and some move to other schools, while others join the mobility program because they and their families are aware of the significant opportunity which awaits them.

The skills to obtain include being able to sell, be in charge of a department and manage the selling space of which they are in charge.\r\nThe language is also kept as an important aspect: students must overcome their language difficulties in their professional and daily life.\r\nThis experience will enable them to reach the required level in language European reference, a common reference for all languages taught in the European Community. \r\nThe cultural aspect, which permits students to discover the social and professional habits and practices of a foreign country, is also very important.

The entire educational team is in charge of training to help broaden the European exposure. The vocational part of the program proposes selling situations ; the English assistant plays an important role in this. The individual training course is used as individual help. Each student may receive personal help in making their mobility report. The aim is to develop their capacity to adapt, to encourage the youth to be more mobile, to improve their language skills and make them more confident.

It is more and more common for retailers to conduct their job interview in English. Therefore it has become an absolute necessity to master the different steps of selling in that language. Furthermore, we will raise awareness to sustainable development among the students involved in the mobility. Indeed, most of them will fulfill their training period in charity shops, which is why we fostered thoughts on that subject. The fair trade shops also known as charity shops collect donations from people and deal with the sales of these products to the benefit of the school association : AVEC (association meant to enhance the commercial learning).These shops are very popular in England. We wish to show our pupils the idea of charity shops, a concept which starts to develop in France. The goal is to adapt that innovative concept to our school. Our students will have to take charge of surveys and enquiries both in France and in England in order to measure the feasiblity of the plan. Back in France, the final-year students will have to convey the gathered information to the second-year students and mentor them. The possible financial benefits will be donated to an organisation as it is the way in the British charity shops.After many unsuccessful attempts we have managed to set up a link that seems to be promising with the Eastbourne Sussex Downs College.

Their english level will be assessed thanks to an interview led both  by teachers and Mrs CHEVALLIER in charge of the placement agency we work with.On site, a 2-teacher-team will make sure everything is all right all through the first and last weeks but also the in-between weekend in order to steer the outings and make pupils organise the various cultural activities so that a team spirit will arise. The final training evaluations being part of the BTEC exam  will have to be conducted by both an english teacher and a sales teacher.Back in France, all of the students will have gained greater independence and self-confidence  which will allow them to undertake studies no longer according to the distance but rather in agreement with their future professional career.We wish to create a dynamic within the school and thus we plan on opening a european section in the \u201cARCU\u201d (welcome and reception of customers) BTEC.

They could eventually improve their technical skills in a foreighn company.Regarding the staff, they will gained  ben,efits,  linguistically and professionnally speaking.We hope they will gain from this experience to put in perspective their own practise.The final goal of this project is also to reinforce the attractivity of our school  and to", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023775_2"], [2017, "D\u00e9couvrir les pratiques professionnelles et les cultures europ\u00e9ennes", "Breakaway Agency Limited", 21352.0, 2, 2, "Anna Rodier Vocational High School is situated in Moulins-sur- Allier, in Auvergne area, 300km from Paris and 200km from Lyon. Situated in an economic-crisis affected basin, the high school offers students a mobility- oriented dynamic vocational training in order to give them the extra opportunities to succeed on the work market.\r\nTherefore, within the framework of the logical development of our professional curricula, adapted and reactive to the economic context, we have been involved for more than ten years in European projects related to mobility through the various European agency programs.\r\n\r\nAll the European projects are monitored by the two mobility referents , also referents at the Auvergne regional council who coordinate the European commission of the high school, made up of a dynamic and pluridisciplinary team, mobilizing the Directorate, the Senior Education Advisor, administrative staff, professional skills and language teachers.\r\n\r\nThe high school has taken an additional step in its European strategy with the opening of a European section in September 2014, after obtaining the accreditation of a teacher as a DNL referent. This approach is part of a desire to increase the chances of offering quality education as described in the 2020 strategy for Europe.\r\nThe specific objectives of our project are to develop the autonomy of our young people from a difficult economic background, some of whom have never gone abroad, to gain confidence, open up to other cultures, improve their technical and language skills, validate part of their training abroad, train the citizens of tomorrow by facilitating professional integration at European and global level.\r\n\r\nCandidates for this project will be selected by the European commission of the high school, after completion of a grid of specific criteria, a test of language level and an interview in English in videoconference with a referent from the Breakaway intermediary placement agency.\r\n The mobilities will be offered to the most motivated and serious students of the 3 classes of Terminale bac Pro Transport, Commerce and ASSP, however giving priority to students from the section Europe benefiting 2 extra hours of English per week.\r\n\r\nWe plan to apply for mobilities for a 2- year period. 9 participants would leave for three consecutive weeks between 26 February and 24 March 2018 to England and 9 others would leave for the same destination between 11 March and 5 April 2019.This will be their last period of training in a company and they will have validated the competencies set by the reference system of their respective diploma during previous internships\r\n\r\nThe Breakaway intermediary placement agency will play a decisive role in the mobilities because it will choose the host families and host companies taking into account the specific field of training of each participant. It will link trainees, tutors and host families and will ensure regular and effective follow-up. Even before the official selection of participants, we have to explain this tripartite relationship to young people and their parents by emphasizing the relationship of mutual trust.\r\nThis permanent cooperation, regularly organized and supervised by official documents, will be carried out by e-mails and telephone contacts.\r\nThe participants are prepared, and supervised by all the protagonists of the project.\r\n\r\nBefore their departure, a pedagogy based on the approach of action- communication will be proposed to the pupils by the teachers of English and DNL in order to help them overcome their difficulties, gain confidence in order to be able to manage professional and daily life situations in England. During their mobility they will be supervised and monitored by the intermediary placement agency. As soon as they come back, they will be assisted in completing their mobility report, their preparation for the Europro and the optional mobility test by  English and professional skills teachers.\r\n\r\nVarious activities will be planned to determine whether the objectives have been met and whether the needs and expectations of the participants have been met.

When they are on their last diploma year, Charles Baudelaire Secondary School - which is located in Fosses in the Gonesse area (95) - gives eighteen Sales, Receptionist and Security students the opportunity to go on a trainee period in Eastbourne. The group of students consists of 10 boys and 8 girls, all living in or near Fosses.These young men and women are really motivated to experiment life abroad, to open their minds and be confronted with the Anglosaxon culture. thus we want them to be part of a European project so as to be efficient on the labour market. Thanks to this project, they could become autonomous, open their minds and learn how to adapt to the working situations. These qualities are essential for future Salesmen/Saleswomen, future Receptionists and future Security Agents.What does this project consist in ?It is a four-week internship under agreement including 15 hours of English lessons. Our students will live in host families and they will be followed through twice by our School and the Service Provider.Where will it happen ?In Eastbourne - a medium seaside city in Sussex which attracts young people and which is near France.

It is essential to pass knowledge on through a work experience on a foreign country.3/ Through the trainee periods, we want to create a link between the British companies and our trainee program.The Assessment:1/ An assessment of the trainee period: we must assess our students for the BTEC National Diploma, following the previous English translated examination grid. They must write a trainee report in order to succeed in the European test on the 2016 BTEC National Diploma. Finally the trainee assessment appears on the students' final school reports.2/ An assessment of the students' interest for their foreign experience. They must fill a grid in before and after their intership.3/ An assessment of the Service Provider.4/ An assessment of the project : we create a log.5/ Indicators: an assessment grid, a log, the budget, the Diploma and european test rates, the rate of students integrating a BTEC Higher National Diploma and the improvements in English.6/ The assessment of the trainee tutors in order to improve and adapt our reports to the professional fields.A Spread Project:- A Europass ceremony.- An experience shared on the School Open Day and on the Area Schools.- An Internet newspaper.- A \u201cEuropean Class\u201d blog.The Context:- A united and mobilized school : the headmaster, the teaching staff, the students and their families.- The European Ressource Center and Mrs Moquin (for her pieces of advice).- Sales, Reception and Security companies and our Service Provider .- The European Commission which allows us to propose this project to our students.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023129_1"], [2015, "For a Reinforcement of  a European Expansion", "Breakaway Agency Limited", 20695.0, 3, 3, "In the follow -up of our previous project, Notre Dame vocational high school wishes  to carry on its willingness to open to Europe by expanding to Italy the work placement opportunities for our students.  It will still be a 3-week period , it will still involve our students (10 students) from the European section of the speciality Administration. We will still maintain and pursue last year project which consisted in including 8 students from the speciality \"sales techniques and reception skills\". But the idea of this project is to diversify geographically the work placement opportunities. For various reasons, cited upstream in the project, we have selected Italy , more precisely Lombardy, the region around the lake Garda, where tourism and shops are booming. For this first experience in Italy, we will suggest this destination to the students from the section \" sales technique and reception skills\", whereas the students from the section Administration, requiring a denser and more precise professional vocabulary will go to England as they already have a quite good command of English in the administration field . Nevertheless, the students heading for Italy will have the opportunity to attend courses of basic Italian, from September up to their departure for Italy. The latter will be accomodated in a youth hostel; Indeed, it will be easier to communicate with young people there in English,Italian or Spanish and even to improve  these foreign languages. There will be a French teacher on the spot all through the period, in England, as well as in Italy. We will work as early as september on the topic of Italy,  on a transversal level (in Arts, geography and history, French literature..) but also as soon as the oppportunity comes up to take part in various events and conferences around Italy. An intense preparation will be done in collaboration with Tempo Libero before the departure and as early as September  regarding the evaluation grids and objectives. Indeed, we had already done this task in the previous years with Breakaway. Regarding the evaluation of the training period in Italy we have decided on a common evaluation in collaboration with a member of Tempo Libero.  Indeed, as the French accompanying teacher doesn't speak Italian it is recommended that a member of Tempo Libero , speaking French, should assist the French teacher  with the evaluation of the student. The interest of this willingness to expand to Italy is,  in the first place,  that this new destination brings a note of originality to the project and to our school. It is definitely more commonplace and less troublesome to send our students to England (as they speak this foreign language and proximity of the country ).

The lack of professional knowledge might create disagreements during the training placement and with the host family:-Incapacity to take part in the social and selling activities.-Difficulties to communicate with the staff and the customers-Refusal  to speak.-Difficulty to adjust in the host family.The European section is composed of a group of fifteen students, the composition of which can change during the three school years: some of them give up because they are not motivated anymore, some move to other schools while others join the section because they are finally aware of the real opportunity which awaits them. Even if only several applicants have already reached the targets, most still have to work on them.The skills to obtain are to be able to sell, be in charge of a department and manage the selling space of which they are in charge.                                                                                                                                                                                     The language is also kept as an important aspect. Students must overcome their language difficulties in their professional or daily life: the problems will highlight their needs (ex: getting an answer or asking for information). This experience will enable them to reach the required level in Language European Reference, a common reference for all languages taught in the European Community.The cultural aspect which permits to discover the social and professional habits and practices of a foreign country is very important too. The well behavior must be a priority as regards the autonomy and personal opening out benefits. The discovery of a new working way and the immersion in a new environment make the students be wide-open minded, assure them a better capacity to adapt and encourage them to be mobile. Finally, the students will acquire better self confidence and will consider their job and their future in a positive way.Every student may pretend to an individual and adapted training during the three school years.The entire teacher team is in charge of training to try to make wider the European exposure. The vocational part of the program proposes selling situations, the English assistant plays an important role in it. The aim is to develop the capacity to adapt, to encourage the youth to crawl out their shells and to communicate with natives in order to improve their language skills and make them more confident. The training period also helps them to acquire new selling skills and other ways of working. Life with a British family opens their eyes to the world towards another social life, to another culture and to other ways of living. Participating in this mobility program makes them improve their professional and language skills and gives them a better maturity level. Young people could now be a part of the employment market thanks to their capacity to be mobile and because of their language improvements.", "http://www.breakaway.fr", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022490_1"]], "extra": 8}}}}
