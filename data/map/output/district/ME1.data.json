The project grow up from a need  in all participating schools' to increase science subject attractiveness and a need to help students to choose well considered future profession. This is based on serious analyzes and schools' development plans. It is therefore essential that schools provide quality teaching and learning in science and technology subjects, allowing pupils to learn both knowledge practical skills. This combination of knowledge and skills is demanded by the European labour market. Schools must now rise to the challenge of developing new approaches and innovative methods which will improve the standard of  teaching and learning  in science and technology subjects. As individuals become increasingly science literate, the more they can contribute to scientific innovations and help to create a better world for all. Another issue is that of young people dropping out of education and training completely. It is very important to find ways to encourage them to return to active education on a sustainable long-term basis. This project should develop Innovative teaching methods and interesting activities that will allow us to address this issue. We will share new ideas, develop innovative teaching and learning methods,  meet new people, work in teams, improve the use of English as a common language and become more competent members of European Union.2.Number and profile of participant-170 3.

Each school is going to become a more modern, dynamic and professional environment, ready to integrate a range of innovative methods, open to society and ready to synergise with other organizations. The project will lead to Improved pupils and teachers competences. A handbook for teachers and DVD will be produced that will illustrate all methods used during the project. During the project, we will make it clear  which tasks the school should realize in its further work, which tasks we plan to include in the plan of school development, and which tasks target the aims which are defined by EU. During the project, participants will identify which science, IT and work-related skills require the most development amongst pupils. Learning activities will be created that will enable the development of these skills. Partners will  collaborate in improving these activities and will publish electronically a review of these activities together with a set of resources which are open for every partner school and its stakeholders and any interested person. A Facebook account and eTwinning platform will be set up for  the above purposes. On completion of the project, a review of the success of the project will be published. Each pupil will have a portfolio of evidence demonstrating how they have developed their science, IT and work-related  skills. The full set of teaching resources will be available electronically. They will learn to use cooperative and interdisciplinary working methods and skills. All the participants will experience a new and appealing approach to learning. Participants will learn how to use a blended learning system (traditional and virtual).

Students often lack the necessary abilities to use these devices in a safe and discriminatory way. At the end of the project, the students will be able to effectively use the ICT tools necessary to produce their final works. - Specific linguistic and communicative objective : to improve the students' oral skills in accordance with the general aims of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages which puts the emphasis on oral skills.
