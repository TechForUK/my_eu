While some improvements in efficiency of road vehicles have been achieved, continued growth in traffic and congestion mean that CO2 emissions from road transport have grown overall. At the same time rising fuel prices and supply instability also give pressure for increased efficiency.  The EC has set targets for the average CO2 emissions of new vehicles to be 120 g/km by 2012, with further reductions needed to achieve a 40% reduction in CO2 from light passenger vehicles by 2020.  The EE-VERT project will develop technologies that will play a key part in achieving these goals.  Despite improvements in individual areas of the modern vehicle such as powertrain, a considerable amount of energy is wasted due to the lack of an overall on-board energy management strategy.  Further electrification of auxiliary systems (the 'more electric vehicle') promises energy and efficiency gains, but there is a need for a co-ordinated and predictive approach to the generation, distribution and use of energy. In the state-of-the-art, power is generated with little knowledge of the actual loads, and some systems (both electrical and mechanical) consume power continually regardless of demand. The introduction of systems such as alternator set-point control and EPAS are first steps towards optimising energy use but such systems operate in isolation.  This project will develop strategies in conventional vehicles, also applicable to hybrids, for overall energy management (thermal and electrical) to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Also, the need for the strategies to guarantee power supply to safety-related systems will be considered.  It is estimated that EE-VERT technologies can reduce CO2 emissions by around 10% for a car.

However, the advent of FEVs in mass production presents new challenges to automotive manufacturers due to the immaturity of the new building blocks, which can reduce FEV's safety and reliability. Among them, is the electric powertrain: i.e. electric traction motors and power electronics controller.Another factor to be taken into account is electromagnetic interference due to the switching technology of power electronics. Furthermore, power electronics and the circulation of high currents from the battery to the motor will emit additional electromagnetic fields (EMF), including Low Frequency (LF) emissions not covered within the current automotive EMC standards.HEMIS project has two major objectives. The first one is to design a Prognostic Health Monitoring System (PHMS), which will sense key physical characteristics related to the health state of the powertrain and the emitted EMF. Based on this information, the PHMS will be able to provide a failsafe state, enhancing public's confidence on the safety and reliability of FEVs. PHMS will also predict the remaining useful life of the equipment, thus enabling enhanced maintenance and reduction of costs, due to acquired knowledge of failure mechanisms. The result of this multidisciplinary research will be a working prototype.The second objective is to provide the manufactures of FEVs with design guidelines regarding EMC and the impact of EMF (including LF emissions) on human health. The research will also result in EMC/EMF testing guidelines for FEV manufacturers, which are expected to be incorporated as a part of emissions standards.

These devices can provide different types of driver support functions and almost nothing is known about their safety and other impacts yet. The market penetration of portable navigators and smart phones is exploding today. The timing for the project is ideal. The functions to be tested cover two broad areas: Functions promoting (i) safe driving and (ii) economic and fuel efficient driving. These are Speed information, Traffic information, Road weather information and 'Green driving' support. The impacts are assessed on levels ranging from usability; behaviour and incidents; safety; Green Driving and efficiency; to the impacts on the transport system. Attention will be also paid to possible negative impacts, since especially smart phones are not originally designed for vehicle use and navigators may have problems in fixing and positioning in the cockpit. The project also aims at speeding up the penetration of systems able to 'see' beyond drivers' field of vision in conditions where good situation awareness is needed. TeleFOT provides opportunities to test the impacts of similar functions future cooperative systems will provide after their development challenges have been solved in the coming years. In fact, aftermarket and nomadic devices provide an alternative to some important cooperative driving and ADAS functions for many years ahead. The concept comprises of creating three European test communities: Northern, Central and Southern. About 3 000 drivers participate in the tests.
