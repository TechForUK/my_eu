We strongly believe that Sail Training offers a unique and extremely effective educational experience. We further believe that we have harnessed this outdoor activity to its fullest educational potential by implementing structured learning programmes.Sail Training as a stand-alone activity offers the opportunity to overcome fears, push boundaries and take on new responsibilities in a challenging environment. By combining it with a structured youth development programme of facilitated, non-formal learning activities, with the specific learning aims set out in this project, we are confident that we can implement a project which is of value to the participants, the partner organisations and the communities involved.Sail Training Ireland (ST.IRL)  are very experienced in running youth development projects, using Tall Ship sailing as a medium for challenge based learning. It is intended to run two main activities: The first is a Youth Exchange Project focusing on 15-17 year olds and the second is a Youth Exchange Project focusing on18-25 years olds.Number and profile of participants:There will be a total of 56 participants on the project, 8 of which will be group leaders/youth workers from the youth agencies involved. The recruitment process will emphasis diversity and inclusion. There will be an equal no of participants from Ireland and the UK. There will be an equal gender divide and equality of gender roles.ObjectivesIn this project Maybe Sailing, and STIRLwill build on previous experience by focusing on:a) The development of transferable skills in participants and their application to future employment opportunities particularly in the maritime sector. And developing an awareness of career opportunities in this sector.b)  Inclusion and diversity and an acceptance of different backgrounds and abilities. Inclusion and diversity will be a core ethos in the recruitment of participants .c) Improving and strengthening the collaboration between the partner organisations.d) Promoting participants confidence and willingness to participate actively in societyMain activities:Under 18s Youth Exchange Voyage and Over 18s Youth Exchange VoyageThe Youth Exchanges will be run consecutively on Tall Ship Maybe. Each voyage in the U18s and Over 18s Youth Exchange will be 10 days long and visit various ports in Ireland and the UK. Competences and skills will be acquired that will be transferable to the personal lives and future employability of the participants. The participants will develop hard-skills necessary to sail a tall ship and will have responsibilities such as keeping watch, cleaning and galley duty. The youth leaders will facilitate learning through activities, reviews and journal writing to achieve the stated learning aims. Career opportunities in the maritime sector will be explored. The following are examples of competencies that will be developed. They are transferable to the everyday lives and many are specifically relevant to employability and to potential careers in the maritime industries:Ability to take on responsibilityCommunicate and work in a teamLeadership skillsConflict resolution skillsConfidenceInitiativePunctualityGood work ethicMotivationAbility to be patient and understand different culturesSeamanship skillsShip operation skillsEngineering requirements on a shipUnderstanding of the shipping industryYouthPass will be used as a mechanism to facilitate self-led learning and record learning achievements.Participants will also gain RYA Competent Crew qualification.Impact of projectThe project will impact on the overall personal development, skills, competences and employability of the participants. Inclusion, diversity and accessibility will be highlighted as issues to be aware of in their communities. Participants will be more likely to actively participate in society.

Our partners in this Erasmus + \u201cMobility of Youth Workers\u201d project are 4 organisations from Ire, the UK, Spain and Portugal. The main activity is taking place in September in Greenwich, London and will be 3 days in duration (plus travel). The project is supported financially by our umbrella organisation Sail Training International. We and S.T.I. are convinced that many more organisations, both Sail Training organisations and Youth Work organisations, across Europe could be running Erasmus + youth exchange projects that harness sail training as a platform for non formal learning every year. There is very strong potential for increasing the number of young people, from all backgrounds that have the opportunity to benefit from this unique experience.We are also convinced that the Erasmus + framework and the structure of these projects brings great benefits to Sail Training and increases the impact that our programmes have on the personal and group development of our young participants.We have successfully run 10 Youth in Action / Erasmus + projects since 2012.    Sail Training is a fun and exciting adventure, which has a profound impact on the lives of participants. \u201cTrainees\u201d take part in voyages at sea on tall ships and large yachts during which they become part of the working crew. This experience provides an excellent environment for personal and social development. It is not so much learning to sail as learning from sailing, from the vessel, the sea and most importantly from yourself and each-other. It is a medium for education outside the classroom, a non-formal approach where the emphasis is on learning through experience. Sail Training Ireland is the Irish member of the global umbrella organisation Sail Training International, a past nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize for their work with young people. Sail Training International\u2019s Mission: \u201cOur purpose is the development and education of young people through the sail training experience, regardless of nationality, culture, religion, gender or social background.\u201dSail Training International has member organisations in 30 Countries around the world, with many EU countries represented. In partnership with Sail Training International we have developed a proposal to bring a number of these organisations together along with youth work professionals with whom they work. The project will focus on the development of Erasmus + projects, partnership building and sharing of experience and learning with regards to harnessing the Sail Training experience as a medium for youth work and Erasmus + projects. The outcome, we hope, will be more  projects being run annually across Europe with multiple partnerships being formed.Participating organisations will:\u2022 Develop an understanding of youth work and structured non-formal education.\u2022 Develop a greater understanding of the value of Sail Training as a medium for youth work and the development of life-skills.\u2022 Sail Training Organisations will learn the importance of having youth work professionals as a partner in their projects. \u2022 For these relationships to be formed through this project and partnerships built.\u2022 For participants to return home with the knowledge and experience to develop Erasmus + projects using Sail Training as platform for educational programmes focusing on youth work and youth development and having their own specific learning objectives.It is through sharing this experience and knowledge that we will empower more organisations to understand their role within the youth work field and start transnational youth work with their young people through youth exchanges and the Erasmus+ programme..  Through this initial project we will develop a quality seminar that can be repeated over time to expand the number of organisations applying for Erasmus + projects.", "http://www.maybe-sailing.com", null, "erasmus_2016-2-IE01-KA105-016956_1"], ["6JT", "Sea Change", "Maybe Sailing Youth Initiative", 27527.0, "Context/Background\r\nMaybe Sailing has been providing Sail Training experiences on Tall Ship Maybe for the past 7 years.
