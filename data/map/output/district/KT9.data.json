This surface is envisaged to be capable of redistributing the pressure, strain and shear applied on the skin. A controller and an algorithm optimizes the load-time curve as pre-specified by the pressure-duration threshold curve, thus protecting the tissues against prolonged and excessive epidermal pressure-shear. This will in turn prevent the onset or deterioration of pressure ulcers. Diagnosis and prevention will rely on intelligent optical fiber sensing devices that can identify the values and coordinates of excessive epidermal loadings and will provide feedback information to an adaptable mattress or seat mechanism. This adaptable mechanism comprises of self-shaping elements and is responsible for relieving pressure and strain in a timely manner according to the information received by the sensing modules. To this end, IASiS intends to develop optical fiber-based two-dimensional pressure/strain/shear sensing elements and demonstrate their performance for the first on rehabilitation applications. It will also integrate the intelligent fiber-based sensing surface with the adaptable surface mechanism, and finally IASiS will evaluate the performance of the developed Intelligent Adaptable Surface through extensive Laboratory as well as Clinical Trials.", 8677.0, 1297184.0, "IASIS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.fujikura.co.uk", null, "fp7_107646_997666244"], ["2NY", "Novel nanotechnology-enabled system for endovascular in vivo near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging and endovascular near-infrared targeted photodynamic therapy of atherosclerotic heart disease", "Fujikura Europe Ltd", "CosmoPHOS-nano is a multidisciplinary, translational and business-oriented project, aiming to accomplish the following objectives:\n1) develop the CosmoPHOS system, which is a novel theranostic (diagnostic & therapeutic) nanotechnology-enabled portable combination system enabling endovascular in vivo near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging, endovascular near-infrared targeted photodynamic therapy, real-time & follow-up therapy monitoring of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD),\n2) nonclinically evaluate this system,\n3) clinically validate the system after regulatory approval, &\n4) reduce in the long-term CAD deaths and morbidity by up to 40%, resulting in a significant decrease of the European and global healthcare costs for CAD, increasing the income of the European healthcare industry from CAD market which is the global largest.

This limits the mobility of students of occupational therapy and their career opportunities at the European level.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objective of a placement in a hospital or other institution offering occupational therapy in other European Union (EU) member states is to increase the student\u00b4s knowledge of the subject and methods employed, leading to improved career prospects throughout the EU. In addition, experience gained should be utilized in the student\u00b4s work and course studies and involvement in the EU network ENOTHE (European Network of Occupational Therapy in Higher Education), of which the school is a member and in which the students actively participate.\r\n\r\nDescription of the placement\r\nIn their placements, the participants become acquainted with the health systems and the various different approaches to occupational therapy in other European countries. Because not all institutions offering placements (or indeed all institutions in which occupational therapy is practised) teach/use all the models employed in occupational therapy, the intercultural exchange with students, teachers and patients in other EU countries provides a valuable addition to our students\u00b4 training. \r\n\r\nOutcome and expected long-term benefits\r\nWe expect our students to further their knowledge of the application and context of occupational therapy treatment methods in other EU countries and widen their experience with the patient groups treated, for example children, stroke patients and the elderly. Contact between the teaching staff here in Germany and at the placement institution enables the exchange of professional competencies, which can then be included in the school curricula.\r\nClinical placements abroad allow students to increase their knowledge of treatment and the underlying concepts because different countries/institutions place emphasis on different areas in training and practice.  They also give students the opportunity to develope  their cultural and sozial skills.\r\n\r\nStudents and sequence of events\r\nThe students are informed at the beginning of the course about the possibility of undertaking one of their placements in another EU country. Medical English and transcultural competence are taught during the course. Those who are interested have the opportunity to attend the annual ENOTHE congress (usually in October) and participate in a student project, which is presented locally after the congress and may be put into practice by  cooperation with a regional partner institution, for example a special needs school.\r\nHalf a year before ending their theoretical studies the students are informed about the practicalities of a placement abroad  and about established contacts with partner institutions and organizational details. As soon as the placements have been confirmed by the partner institutions, the chosen students receive individual preparation for their placements from the teaching staff. \r\nBefore travel, the students are given all the necessary documents. On return from the placement they receive their Europass-Mobility from the project managers. Because of the timing of training, punctual completion of the project is guaranteed. \r\n\r\nTeacher\r\nThe school places great value on contact with other members of the profession at the European level, to enable the exchange of ideas and experiences. Attendance at lectures and presentations of the European Network of Occupational Therapy in Higher Education allows the member of staff representing the school to gather information relevant to the profession. New developments are thus communicated to the teaching staff and incorporated into the curriculum. Further development of professional skills occurs in the course of the project and knowledge of advancements so acquired is subsequently assimilated into the day-to-day tuition at the school.", "http://www.achievingforchildren.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-004035_3"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2NY", "LONDON WALL INSTALLATIONS LIMITED*", 329.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_72812", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "KT9"}
