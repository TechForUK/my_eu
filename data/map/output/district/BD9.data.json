MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of Allergy) aims at generating novel knowledge on mechanisms of allergy initiation, in particular in childhood. To understand how a complex network of genetic and environmental factors leads to complex allergic phenotypes, a novel stepwise, large and integrative translational approach is needed. MeDALL includes experts in allergy, epidemiology, genetics, immunology, biology, animal models, biochemistry and systems biology combining strengths of ongoing EU projects. Classical phenotypes (expert-based) and novel phenotypes of allergy (hypothesis-free statistical modelling) are compared.  Population-based data are collected from a cross-sectional study (Karelia) and existing birth-cohorts followed using a common protocol. IgE to foods and inhalants are tested using component-resolved diagnosis across Europe in populations. Biomarker profiles (\u201cfingerprints\u201d) are extensively assessed using epigenetics, targeted proteomics and unbiased transcriptomics in a subsample of the study population. Those associated with allergic phenotypes are validated in large study populations. Relevant fingerprints are combined into network biomarker phenotype \u201chandprints\u201d using a systems biology approach and validated in a sufficiently powered sample. Animal studies and in vitro human immunology reinforce the validation. This information coupled with classical and novel phenotypes characterize environmental protective and susceptibility factors of allergy and risk groups. Results are fitted into new integrative complex mathematical models to establish suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis, prevention and targets for therapy of allergy-associated diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis.

A large European study is working to unravel the complex network of genetic and environmental factors implicated in allergy development during childhood.", "Allergic diseases are associated with a hypersensitive reaction of our immune system. This is triggered by IgE antibodies that under normal circumstances are present in minute amounts in the body. During allergy, IgE molecules bind to specific substances known as allergens and trigger a cascade of events capable of causing inflammation.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Mechanisms of the development of allergy' (http://www.medall-fp7.eu/ (MEDALL)) project represents an integrative translational approach that aims to understand the mechanisms that trigger allergy formation. By bringing together experts in the field of immunology and allergy, MEDALL hopes to identify the molecular and environmental factors that lead to complex allergic phenotypes. Teams are working under the rationale that events early on in childhood are predictive of allergic disease development later on.\n\nFor this purpose, they have collected clinical information and samples from thousands of children aged 4\u20138 years and are in the process of performing an epidemiological analysis. Diagnostic arrays have also been used to specify the types of allergens and associate them with exposure at an early age.\n\nAt the epigenetic level, scientists have identified methylation marks at several genomic loci, which are predictive of allergic disease and asthma development later on in childhood. This information will ultimately be combined with transcriptomic analysis to identify alterations in gene expression levels associated with allergy development. Ongoing analysis of immune cells present in asthmatic lungs should also portray a picture on the role of different types of cells in allergy.\n\nConsiderable effort has also been devoted to the development of mouse models of allergy and asthma. Pre-clinical work to show the function of B\u00a0regulatory and B\u00a0effector cells and the role of IL-21 in the development of asthma is currently taking place.\n\nThe outcome of the MEDALL study will improve our understanding of allergy phenotypes and expand knowledge on the determinants of allergy and asthma in childhood.

It is expected to be revolutionised by the widespread introduction of LED solid state technology. However, LED technology has some major problems to overcome on the delivered efficiency of multi-LED lights, cost, and the quality of the light colour produced.\n\nHERCULES will produce solutions for LED lighting for a range of applications. It will build on a successfully demonstrated concept that combines the light from different LED sources to produce near perfect colour rendition at colour temperatures as low as 2500K. HERCULES will provide the normal benefits of LED lighting \u2013 high electrical energy to light conversion efficiency (reducing energy consumption), instant start-up and efficient dimmability, but will also allow tuneable colour rendering for applications such as food retailing.\n\nIt is essential that light sources produce high quality colour rendition, which has proved critical to the health and productivity of workers. High efficiency LEDs have very poor colour rendering and current approaches use multiple phosphors on each LED to generate a poor typically \u201cblue rich\u201d approximation to natural light. These phosphors can seriously reduce the efficiency of the LED, so more LEDs are required to achieve the light ouput. In a compact light source this has the effect of increasing the temperature of the LEDs, which has a very negative feedback as their efficiency decreases rapidly with temperature. The HERCULES solution will overcome this serious limitation.\n\nThe key developments in this project will be:\n\u2022\tCharacterisation and selection of suitable high efficiency LEDs\n\u2022\tNovel electronic driver design\n\u2022\tOptical design for several form factors, especially to de-image LEDs\n\u2022\tLow cost injection moulding tool making technique for optical finish\n\u2022\tPrecision injection moulding of optical elements\n\u2022\tNovel luminaire design for indoor/outdoor/specialist applications'", 23452.0, 1128143.0, "HERCULES", "Goodbye bluish lighting, Hello Sunshine", "With EU support, scientists have delivered a light-emitting diode (LED)-based system that produces full colour rendering and has 95 % efficiency. The new lighting even allows you to programme a circadian rhythm of light fluctuation from your cell phone.", "Solid-state lighting using LEDs has taken a major market share from standard fluorescent lighting in recent years. LEDs offer higher energy efficiency and rapid start-up at a reasonable cost. However, poor colour rendering resulting in a bluish output can be unpleasant, stressful and tiring for the eyes. When used for surgical lights, they can impair the ability to discern skin, tissue and organ details, affecting the quality of surgery.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'High efficiency and rendered colour using LED solid state lighting' (http://www.hercules-project.eu/ (HERCULES)) sought major improvements in LED-based illumination with a key target being the medical sector. Scientists focused on increasing the efficiency, brightness and colour of a medical luminaire (complete lighting unit) while ensuring that it can be disinfected. Efficiency depends on LED selection, colour mixing, the electronic driving circuitry and the thermal design.\n\nHERCULES delivered an advanced lighting system that combines light from different LED sources to produce near-perfect colour rendition across the full visible spectrum at extremely high efficiency.\n\nScientists showcased the technology in two demonstrators: a bed head light and an examination light. The bed light has controllable colour temperature to match the natural circadian rhythms of day and night. It comes with a dedicated programmer, but can also be programmed and controlled from a smartphone. The examination light is equipped with five colour settings ranging from cold to warm white light. The high R9 (saturated red) colour rendition enables greater resolution of tissue differences for surgical procedures, whereas the cold white  setting supports general examinations and is particularly good for visualising veins, required for safe and painless drawing of blood.\n\nHERCULES developed a highly efficient, full colour rendering and cost-effective LED lighting system with broad applications wherever good colour rendition is a necessity. The technology will significantly enhance the competitive position of related small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU. Partner SMEs have developed a realistic exploitation plan and are on their way to market.

These cohorts have already collected large amounts of data as part of national and EU-funded projects. Results will be integrated with data from European cohorts (>300,000 subjects) and registers, to estimate health impacts at the large European scale.\n\nHELIX will make a major contribution to the integrated exposure concept by developing an exposome toolkit and database that will: 1) measure a wide range of major chemical and physical environmental hazards in food, consumer products, water, air, noise, and the built environment, in pre and postnatal periods; 2) integrate data on individual, temporal, and toxicokinetic variability, and on multiple exposures, which will greatly reduce uncertainty in exposure estimates; 3) determine molecular profiles and biological pathways associated with multiple exposures using omics tools; 4) provide exposure-response estimates and thresholds for multiple exposures and child health; and 5) estimate the burden of childhood disease in Europe due to multiple environmental exposures.

Prospective studies focusing on periods of high susceptibility, such as early life, should help predict individual disease risks related to the environment.", "Major environmental hazards may lead to serious, chronic pathologies with large societal and economic costs, especially when exposure takes place during pregnancy or early life. Pollutants in food, water and air may be linked to a number of diseases such as neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular disorders. To address this susceptibility through appropriate preventative measures and legislation, comprehensive data on exposure is required. In addition, we need to evaluate the combinatorial impact on health of exposure to multiple hazards.\n\nThe term exposome is used to describe the totality of exposure to environmental hazards from conception onwards. The EU-funded http://www.projecthelix.eu/ (HELIX) initiative will use prospective birth cohort studies at different sites across Europe to obtain the comprehensive, longitudinal human data needed to build on this concept.\n\nThrough specially developed tools and methods, the HELIX consortium will obtain estimates on the health impact of chemical and physical exposures in food, consumer products, water, air and the outdoor environment (external exposome). They will link these environmental exposures with alterations in the levels of metabolites, proteins, RNA transcripts and DNA methylation (internal exposome). This molecular signature will be measured by omics analyses in the cohorts.\n\nUsing novel statistical approaches, researchers will also try to associate multiple and combined environmental exposures with child health, focusing on overall growth, obesity, neurodevelopment and respiratory and allergic diseases. Importantly, HELIX will address the determinants (e.g. diet, social factors, and commuting habits) of individual variability in early-life exposures, in order to better predict individual disease risk and direct preventions.\n\nOverall, HELIX will provide a better understanding of the effect of multiple environmental exposures early on during development.
