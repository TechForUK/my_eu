Vocational orientation is an integral part of the Waldorf School curriculum in Austria, therefore the aim is to offer high quality work placements in Europe as a part of quality development in this field of the upper grades of the Waldorf Schools.\r\nThe participants do a 2 to 8 weeks work placement (agricultural training, industrial placement, social placement).  Waldorf Schools are comprehensive schools with a wide range of knowledge from upper secondary school level to pupils with special needs. The receiving partners (SME, large company, NGO, Charity organisations) are situated in at least 9 countries (Germany,  Ireland, United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Iceland, Portugal) and choosen with  focus on sustainability. The partnerships are evaluated through the project reports of former Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ projects and by personal contacts. New partners could join the project due to the students interests. We paid attention to geographical and language variety to offer a wide choice. In the field of project management the coordinators at the sending schools are working close together.\r\nIn the schools they support the pupils prior, during and after the mobility. They arrange Learning Agreements with the receiving partner and the student and are responsible for the validation of the learning results. At the regular project meetings problems are discussed, and any organisational questions are clarified. The evaluation meetings with the students are also organised then.\r\nWe expect good progress in the field of language skills, intercultural awareness, learning, initiative and especially personal development like increasing independence and self reliance and creativity.

All students of the HLW Lienz have to do a compulsory internship of 3 months after the end of the third year and before the fourth year. Many of the students do this internship abroad, mainly in Great Britain, Ireland and Italy. As interns are often paid very little or sometimes even nothing in these countries, the Erasmus+ project supports the students financially. By doing the intership abroad the students improve their language skills, they get an insight into what it is like to work in another country and they broaden their view of the world concerning culture and multiculturalism. After having done the internship abroad the students feel more self-assured and self-confident which has a positive impact on their performances at school as well as in their private life. \r\n18 participants are going to take part in this year's Erasmus+ project. The HLW/HF Lienz has already had successful business relations with partner companies in Great Britain, Ireland and Italy for many years now. The project coordinator and the teachers at the HLW/HF Lienz support their students throughout the whole project, starting by helping them to write the CVs to booking the flights. During the project many different activities are done which help the students to successfully complete their internship. Already before the students choose where to do their internship they get informed about the possibility of doing it abroad and about how the Erasmus+ project works. As soon as having decided to do it abroad these students get more specific information so that they are perfectly prepared for their stay in another country. Again it is the project coordinator and specific teachers who support the students. During the project the project coordinator always stays in touch with the students and quickly acts if questions arise. \r\nFor the future of the HLW/HF Lienz the Erasmus+ project is very important because it is the possibility for students to do their internship abroad and by doing so broaden various competences which is really advantageous for their future.", "http://www.carbisbayhotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA102-039091_3"]]}}}}
