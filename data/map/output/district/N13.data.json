One of the most considerable possibilities of gaining new knowledge is learning from the experiences of the other countries. To provide the learning quality in accordance with the contemporary requirements, the school needs an extra knowledge in managing the learning process, arranging the studies, operating the new digital technology and implementing the new curricula. The staff of the vocational school needs new experiences in using the modern active learning methodologies, work-based learning, changes in evaluation of skills and competences and creating the new forms of collaboration to support the reforms in the learning conceptions. \r\n\r\nFor achieving it the school has started a project \u201cThe Best Practices from Europe\u201d. The aim of the project is to improve the learning process and enhance the arrangement of students\u2019 placements in the light of the change of the approach to learning and send the students to perform their professional placements in the companies of European countries. \r\n\r\nThe activities during the project are planned to take place on three levels: \r\n1) The mobilities of the school staff, including the vocational teachers, to European vocational schools to gain knowledge and get experiences how to improve the  process of updating the learning process and to enhance the practical arrangement of placements (including the work-based learning). \r\n2) The practice of the vocational teachers in the partner companies of our partner schools to complement their skills and competences and get aware of the modern trends in their specialty.\r\n3) The placements of the students in the partner companies of our partner schools and the schools\u2019 practicing bases to improve their vocational skills and competences\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Project are implemented during 2 years, 2015-2017.

The criteria for choosing the vocational teachers is the wish and willingness of the teacher to improve his/her knowledge and professional skills and competences, the readiness to practice in the company of another country and the needful language skills for individual succeeding. The criteria for choosing the students for the placement is their willingness and wish to improve their skills and competences, their progress and attitude to their studies, their adaptability, team-working and language skills, and willingness to improve their language skills on the courses before the internship. \r\n\r\nAfter every staff mobility or placement of the vocational teacher the school arranges a seminar, where the participants present their knowledge and experiences and and how are they going to implement it into their work. \r\n\r\nIn spring 2016 and 2017 the traditional annual conferences of the school will be held, where all the school staff and the partner enterprises of the school will participate and where the staff members, teachers and students who have taken part in mobilities present their best experiences they have gained. \r\n\r\nThe students who have done their placements abroad share their experiences on public placement presentations where the co-students and vocational teachers take part. \r\n\r\nThe manager of the present project is the Coordinator of External Relations, who is responsible for co-operation, implementation of activities, preparation work with the participants, all the travelling, hosting and insurance questions and project documentation.

The project is a follow up event to youth exchange Greenskills that took place in Poland in November 2013 during the UN Climate Conference in Warsaw. Now in 2015 a new Climate Conference in about to take place in Paris. Climate-Action project's idea is to enhanced cooperation between organisations in the youth field, international organisations, cultural centers and experts. For this purpose young people working on the project have established cooperation with ecological experts, cultural centers in Svalbard and the final goal of the project is to attract wider audience through preparing a video presenting the problem and uploading it to the social media.It is young people's duty to plug in this generation with increasingly strong social and environmental awareness, the energy and knowledge to lead our societies towards climate resilient future. The rapid environmental change demands that human beings not only think in terms of weeks, years and decades but across generations.  The objectives of this project are primarily to raise awareness among young people about the effects of the climate change, and to empower young people to raise their voice in the global debate on preserving natural environment. Other objective is the increased learning mobility opportunities for young people, through organizing the event on Svalbard region highly affected and topic of intense debate. A travel to arctic will give to young participants broader perspective on the topic, but also a platform to reaching wider audience through allowing them to witness on the spot the real effects of the climate change and thus to prepare a reliable dissemination results that will be later shared on the social medias.Within Climate-Action project, we attempt to:- to promote the pro-ecological way of living in Europe thanks to the use of social media and the intellectual outcomes of the expedition of young people to Svalbard - to teach young people that through creating intentional groups we could more efficiently tackle the contemporary social issues- presenting Svalbard as an integral European territory, and involving young Europeans into caring about this land- fostering cooperation between young people from Europe, UK, Svalbard, Norway and Turkey.The project predicts 10 participants from UK, Norway and Turkey who will spend time together with each other in 2016. The participant profile is: being fluent in English, interested in the topic of ecology or sustainable development, motivated to implement follow-up actions.

They should distribute documentation on their region and discuss with the visitors about the different Christmas customs in Europe. The hosting partner will above all organize  an entertainment program together with other Italian schools or organizations. Its principal will ask the local Municipality to invite local primary schools to visit the exhibition with their pupils, thus giving them an opportunity to have a \"European look\" at Christas and its customs. After the official opening of the exhibition to the public, the event continues with a Parade through the old city of San Benedetto del Tronto, to promote the event amongst the local population, in which the participants march in their traditional Christmas clothes ( e.g. Saint Lucia for Sweden, Beffana for Italy, St Nicholas (Sinterklaas) for the Czech Republic or Hous\u00e9cker for Luxembourg, Christkindel for Alsace, St Nikolaus and Krampus for Austria, Father Frost and the Little Snow Child for Russia, aso) with their national flags and those of the AEHT and the Erasmus+ Program fluttering in the breeze along a route decided by the organizers.

The guests are the participants themselves as well as special guests invited by the hosting partner who supported financially or materially the event. For the following day is scheduled a Cultural show at the City theater with presentations by each delegation on Christmas traditions (songs, music, dances, legends, sketches, ...) in their respective countries. A religious Church Service may be considered an optional extra, and attendance will be free choice.
