However despite these growth rates, the proportion of RES used for domestic heating and hot water is still under one percent. The main barrier is the high equipment and installation cost of the technology. In addition solar thermal yields cannot always be optimally utilised in existing hot water and heating systems. This is due to the limited size and operating temperature range of conventional thermal energy stores. Increasing the contribution of RES will also necessitate larger thermal stores, which is often difficult due to space and cost constraints. Although higher density Phase Change Materials (PCM) show promising results, they have not been proven to deliver real improvements in domestic applications. In PipeStore, we propose to develop a modular and low cost thermal storage technology, based on a \u2018pipes-in-a-pipe\u2019 configuration that can contain a range of PCMs. These will have different melting temperatures, enabling the storage of lower grade thermal energy. This will increase the effective utilisation of a typical solar system by up to twenty percent. Furthermore, a novel actuation and control system will facilitate the use of supercooled PCMs. This will be enable optimal energy storage with a controlled rapid thermal discharge. PipeStore can be scaled and customised to suit any RES in any property. The technology can be positioned in a loft, between walls or in a garage etc. This means that buildings with space limitations can also benefit from RES. The market for thermal storage relating to RES is currently \u20ac500 million in the EU and is expected to expand at a rate of at least ten percent per year. Our aim is to capture a five percent market share by 2020 which will be worth \u20ac40 million per year.", 10803.0, 824655.0, "PIPESTORE", null, null, null, "http://www.pipestore.eu/", "http://www.biodigital.co.uk", null, "fp7_107652_985234142"], ["2SZ", "Security and decontamination of drinking water distribution systems following a deliberate contamination", "Kelda Group Plc", "Vulnerability of drinking water distribution systems to deliberate attacks, which would have major public health, economic and psychosocial consequences, is one of the main issues of concern to regulatory agencies, and water utilities.

It has also created tools to rapidly locate the source of contamination and its spreading and ways to clean the water distribution system, including the inner walls of the pipes.\n\nTo develop the early warning system, researchers tested a wide range of new sensors to detect any significant changes in water quality, and advanced mathematical models to optimise the position of those sensors in the water network. They also looked at methods to identify the source of contamination.\n\nMany cleaning and decontamination methods were then tested to find the most effective approach for reservoirs and pipe walls. Approaches to the accurate and safe handling of decontamination waste were also developed.\n\nThe SecurEau team used their results to generate a final model and decision tool (which can be appended to the obligated water safety plan) for dealing with contamination.

Focus is on natural toxins \u2013 a large group of emerging contaminants with unknown impact on drinking water resources. Both known toxins, like cyanotoxins, cyanogenic glucosides and terpenes and not yet explored toxins will be investigated. Twenty leading universities, research institutions, and water enterprises will pioneer the field through joint training of 15 ESRs investigating natural toxin emission via water reservoirs to water works and consumers. The natural toxin challenge is addressed by the concerted work of the ESRs within 4 scientific work packages comprising origin, distribution, fate and remediation. Priority toxins are selected using in silico approaches accompanied by novel non-targeted and targeted analyses to map natural toxins along vegetation and climatic gradients in Europe. Invasion of alien species, toxin emission, leaching and dissipation will be under strong influence of climate change. Data collected for toxin emission, properties and fate will be used to model effects of climate, land use, and design of remediation actions. Special attention will be paid to toxin removal at water works including development of new technologies tailored to remove natural toxins. The results will contribute to strengthening of European policies and regulation of drinking water, while new business opportunities within the fields of water supply and treatment, chemical monitoring and sensing, and the consulting sector will arise from academia-indstry collaborations.
