Peace education has been shown to promote reconciliation by developing empathy, critical thinking and moral responsibility. Various factors for building resistance to conflict have been identified as key: the provision of access to an \u2018evidence base\u2019 of balanced information; active engagement with information to familiarise users with concepts of evidence, authenticity and critical thinking; and inclusive spaces for dialogue between communities, in which reconciliation is forged through participation. We take these participatory approaches and map them into the digital sphere. While social media are widely used for participation, their potential for abuse makes them unsuitable for such dialogue. More focused platforms have emerged to support the public\u2019s engagement with information, issues and each other, such as Ushahidi, which focuses on collecting and sharing data about unfolding situations, to involve communities in dealing with them. We will build on this software to develop a participatory platform that supports active engagement with bodies of information, allowing communities to share, organise, enhance, and reuse it, within a digital space for information-driven processes of reflection and informed, constructive dialogue. The platform will be piloted and evaluated in two countries recovering from civil conflict, Rwanda and Kenya, and the reach of the trials will be extended into areas of poor connectivity via BRCK hotspot devices. We will follow a living labs methodology based on social innovation and co-creation, involving close engagement with citizens and communities in participatory design and evaluation events throughout the project.

Results show a clear split in European opinion. This survey raised humanistic, emotional, political and economical questions with the Italian and Dutch school in our current partnership. For instance, why do so many people in Europe not support the reception of people from war zones? People in need who lost all security and possessions. Why do people\u2019s views from various European countries differ so widely on this important issue? What will be the consequences for Europe if we as a union cannot deal with this crisis in a united and constructive way?The Italian and Dutch school in this project expressed the wish to form a partnership that addresses these issues and questions. On etwinning, they found partners in some of the other countries included in the opinion poll (Denmark and Great Britain), but also partners in countries that can be seen as the most important gateways into Europe (Greece and Turkey).So, the choice of studying refugees and frontiers as a transnational project is necessary as this is one of the biggest challenges the EU has had to face so far. Millions of people attempting dangerous sea crossings and walking for days to reach certain EU countries indicates there are major issues (in the countries from which they are fleeing, but also within the EU because of different approaches and attitudes). In mixed European groups, the students will study the rationale behind the current policy framework within the EU as well as the human stories that hide behind these policies.Different countries all have different approaches in dealing with the current situation: Can we learn from them? Is it possible to establish a common approach in dealing with the crisis? How do partner countries deal with immigration from outside of the EU? Working collaboratively with students from partner countries will enable students to give a better understand the process of dealing with refugees and their rights in partner countries, essential to develop a greater European identity. The goal is that it will empower them to consider situations in a Pan European context rather than viewing it solely as a state or a local issue.All activities (school activities, international meeting etc.) during this project will be linked to the questions we raised above. It will be an unique process and experience that are participants will go through. In order to pass these experiences on to the rest of Europe, we set a goal.Our goal is to create a website filled to the brim with teaching tools. This open educational resource (OER) captures all the experiences from us and our students during this project. It will be for young people by young people. All lesson plans, individual activities and so on will incorporate the 21st century skills. Next to IT skills, the most relevant skills here would be collaboration, critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, social skills, and cultural skills. This unique OER means that other students and teachers at other schools throughout Europe will be able to benefit. We hope to make our contribution to a more positive and unified Europe.The specific objectives being pursued in this project:\u2022 improve understanding why refugees flee their own countries and wish to live within the EU;\u2022 better understanding of practices and policies linked to the refugee crisis;\u2022 greater understanding and responsiveness to social, ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity in and outside of Europe;\u2022 to promote a greater sense of European identity; \u2022 more active participation in society concerning the refugee issue and integration aspects;\u2022 more positive attitude towards the European project and the EU values;\u2022  increased competence in the English language;\u2022  increased level of digital competence and ICT skills", "http://www.dukeries.attrust.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NL01-KA219-022888_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["0PA", "AEGIS TRUST", 235079.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_15708", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NG22"}
