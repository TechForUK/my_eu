The work placement will be recognized as a mandatory internship within the curriculum of their school-based vocational training. As school-based trainees they have an increased need for practical training.  \r\nAll participants individually write a work placement report in English or Spanish respectively and a report on their overall experiences and learning outcomes after returning home (in German language). These reports are then used for documentation and evaluation purposes. All participants receive the EUROPASS Certificate (Mobility) and Work Placement Certificates.\r\nThe internships are scheduled for spring 2015 and 2016 \u2013 two groups of 15 participants each travelling to London or M\u00e1laga respectively (altogether 60 participants within a 24 months period).\r\na. Our trainees specializing in IT will have the opportunity to take up a full-time work placement in London, England. They are placed in business-, administration- or IT-related positions mostly within small- and medium-sized companies (SME). Within their two-year vocational training course English is obligatory and a subject of examination.   English is also the common technical language in IT and therefore of great importance and a key for lifelong learning within their field of specialization. In London the participants will get the chance to improve their practical skills as well as their English skills thus covering several subject areas at the same time. \r\nThe receiving organization is TWIN (TWIN Group, London, UK). TWIN is not only responsible for the allocation of work placements but also for the accommodation of our participants in local host families.\r\nb. Our trainees specializing in foreign languages will be given the chance to go to M\u00e1laga, Spain, for a work placement and intensive language training. For these students Spanish is obligatory and a subject of examination within their two-years of vocational training in Germany. They usually do not have any Spanish language skills when they beginn their vocational training therefore we have chosen to supplement the work placement in Spain by an intensive Spanish language course.\r\nThe work placements (mostly in local SMEs) are selected by our Spanish partner Malaca Instituto taking into account the limited Spanish language skills of our participants. Malaca Instituto also provides the Spanish courses and offers accommodation on campus. In addition to the EUROPASS and the Work Placement Certificate the students going to Spain also receive a Language Certificate \u2013 documenting their acquired skills according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.\r\nAll participants are selected by BZM and in addition to language training they take part in a compulsory preparatory (intercultural) seminar which is tailored to the specific needs of the target group and to the target country. During their stay in London and M\u00e1laga the trainees are supervised and looked after by an accompanying teacher from BZM (preferably one of their specialist subject teachers).", "http://www.twinuk.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000091_1"], ["5JX", "Auslandspraktika f\u00fcr Kaufm\u00e4nnische Assistenten in Spanien und England", "Twin Training International Ltd", 13624.0, "The background is the requirement to do a 6-weeks\u2018  work-experience-placement for a successful completion of the training course to qualify as \u201aKaufm\u00e4nnischer Assistent- Fremdsprachen und Korrespondenz\u2018 (business course specializing in correspondence and foreign languages).

Participants complete industrial internships in small and medium-sized enterprises in England, gaining an insight into the following areas: Marketing, PR and publicity, administration, accounting, logistics and warehouse organization. In all internships, participants are given the opportunity to interact with customers allowing for targeted use and improvement of their language skills.

Young entrepreneurs face great difficulties in starting their own business. It is not only the external environment that creates the chaos for young entrepreneurs but inner difficulties such lack of self-confidence, lack of skills, insufficient leadership capabilities and similar issues. One of the most important decisions for any entrepreneur is choosing what sort of business he or she wants so we will be looking at initial decisions that entrepreneurs need to look seriously at and trainers/coaches need to be attentive to. Moreover, for an entrepreneur, recognition and a sense of achievement are fundamental motivators which have significant consequences in the way entrepreneurs approach and manage their businesses. In a similar way, entrepreneurs need to align their personal goals with their business goals and need to have important skills like motivating others. Furthermore, self-empowerment is a process by which individuals increasingly take greater charge of themselves and their lives. All these issues will be important in the training course. \r\n\r\nThe most important objective of the project \"Coaching Young Entrepreneurs - Providing Support in Making the First Step\" is to provide non-formal training to youth workers in order to enhance their capacities and skills to be able to motivate youth in taking the initiative of starting its own business and making a positive transition to the work field.  The project addresses directly the issues of entrepreneurship, creativity and employability of young people in Europe and has a strong alignment with the objectives of the Erasmus Plus programme and its objectives. The \"FIRST-STEP\" project aims at promoting young people's commitment towards a more inclusive growth by helping youth workers to become more aware and be able to stimulate young people\u2019s spirit of initiative, creativity and entrepreneurship and employability through the use of coaching tools and promotion of the entrepreneurial spirit.  The project is more specifically aiming at providing a training course which will provide an educational learning experience on the topic of providing coaching and support for young people wanting to become entrepreneurs and thus will improve participants \u2019competences, knowledge, skills and attitudes in coaching and counseling. This will lead to higher quality practice in youth work for all participating organizations. \r\n\r\nWorking methods: The methodology that will be used is based in non-formal and informal training methods utilizing what Mezirow called Transformational Learning. Participants will be part of a highly interactive, experiential and holistic training thus engaging their minds, bodies and emotions. The methodology also includes tools from the art, which can help participants relax and connect in a meaningful way. Methodology of the project \u201cCoaching Young Entrepreneurs - Providing Support in Making the First Step\u201c is designed to facilitate the acquisition of skills and specific knowledge of business culture, consistent with the objectives and anticipated results. The proposed methodology will ensure the active involvement of young people favor each of the stages and activities of this project. In this way young people learn to work as a team, listen to the views of all, to collaborate and manage situations they face. This will foster feelings of acceptance of learning differences, tolerance and the assumption of views in argumentative manner. Provide non-formal methods proposed framework for cooperative learning and learning from the experience of others, the interactive methods that focus on ideas and arguments supporting their opinions on confrontation.
