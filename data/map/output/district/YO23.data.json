Obesity is a key economic and healthcare challenge for Europe. Effective interventions and commercial programmes for weight loss are widely available, but most people re-gain their lost weight. Currently few comprehensive solutions exist to help Europeans manage weight loss maintenance (WLM).\nCurrent research suggests the most promising evidence-based behaviour change techniques for WLM are self-monitoring, goal setting, action control, building self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation. Recent research also suggests that stress management and emotion regulation skills are key enablers of relapse prevention and weight-regain.\n\nInformation technology offers attractive tools for teaching and supporting these techniques, some of which are currently delivered through resource-intensive face-to-face therapies. ICT-delivery includes networked-wireless tracking technologies, weighing-scales and activity sensors, online tools and smart-phone apps, multi-media resources and internet-based support. A broad choice of tools is most likely to be acceptable to users, who can pick and choose their own preferred technologies. \nThe NoHoW project tests whether ICT-based delivery of the most promising evidence-based behavior change techniques is effective for WLM. We will carry out a large-scale international 3-centre trial of information technology tools that implement the most up-to-date behavioural science research. This trial will establish the effectiveness of these ICT tools in supporting WLM, linked to studies of European consumer needs and behaviour.\n\nImpact: The project will directly feed results into development of new products and services from the UK\u2019s largest commercial weight-loss provider, Slimming World providing immediate benefit to 500,000\\ consumers.

York College seemed as a natural choice, as they already successfully work with other Norwegian schools and have the necessary expertise to satisfy the requirements of the Norwegian authorities. We believe that studying at a foreign school with different methods, living in homestay families and getting to know new people will have a huge, positive impact on young vocational students. To strengthen the development of the skills and continues development of competence and quality, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation with other countries and EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from Rud High School have visited York College on a number of occasions. We have had with us groups of students to enable them to take part in the study of Skin Care for a few days at a time. This has involved them working side by side with local students both in practical and theoretical classes. They have also met and dealt with members of the public who come in to college for treatment from students under guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is that students and teachers from Rud High School gain insight into how other schools facilitate a training in the discipline of Skin Care, while the students have the opportunity to learn other methods of learning and other methods and types of therapy than we have the opportunity to teach and practice at our school. There are a larger number of students at York College, more teachers with expertise in the field, and smaller classes where the teacher has the opportunity to provide individual guidance. An English language based collaboration with a UK college like York also gives our pupils and teachers the chance to acquire experience in working with students from many other countries all over the world. This will give the students a broader understanding of culture across national boundaries. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRud High School aims to offer this program to four students each year who complete their first year in the field of Health and Social Care at first year level (VG1). The intention is that students from all over the County of Akershus seeking this opportunity can apply to Rud do a year in York.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggested Plan of Action\r\n\r\nStudents from Rud High School will be integrated into classes with other local students. This includes the teaching of theory and involves taking modular exams for each subject on a par with local students. Digital tools are being used in the classrooms teaching and in connection with projects and exams.  After all modules are passed, the students take an interdisciplinary examination which will be conducted in the same manner as in Norway. Students also participate in practical work where they conduct subject-related treatments on students and clients. In addition to the program at York College, students also participate in trade shows in the UK that help them to keep up to date on the latest research and innovations in the field. It is considered important to preserve quality improvements, new discoveries and development and stimulate entrepreneurial skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeachers from Rud High School will visit York College several times a year to monitor their students and to lay the ground for further cooperation and development of the project.  Trips are organized and are designed to give students a broader picture of modern society, including cultural and social developments, and an understanding of historical background.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results\r\n\r\nThe skills and knowledge acquired through this year will give students the opportunity to continue in their final year (VG3) at Rud High School.  The study year abroad will have given them insights into another culture and notably into different styles of teaching and learning and sustainability. Their ability to communicate in English will have been considerably improved, providing them with a broader base both professionally, but also in general social and cross-cultural terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential long-term plans\r\n\r\nRecruitment to professions in the field of Health and Social Care in Norway is declining, while the need in the community continues to increase. We hope that the program we are developing may increase the recruitment of Skin Care students. In addition we believe that this program can facilitate a lasting partnership between the two educational institutions concerned.

This is as a result of influx of European immigrants (and change in age demographic of the inhabitant) to fill vacancies created by the need and demands for jobs in the local labour market. The need for the college in providing training for local and regional employers has changed, and it is posing a number of challenges to us as a training provider. The college has identified a need to internationalise the curriculum, introduce the European dimension in our vocational training to prepare and expose our learners to European cultures. York College is also working in continuing to develop staff competences, continue to improve and better teaching, learning through the introduction of new acquired teaching methods and tools and encourage linguistic skills (to meet the demand of the City and North Yorkshire visitors and changes in demographics) which will shape the curriculum and portfolio on offer for our local and regional community. The college is one of the major vocational training  providers in the county and it is facing new challenges in meeting the training needs associated with the new health and care workers and cooks (who work in the health sector) requirements and challenges. \r\nWe wish to use the project to link it to vocational training in Health & Social Care and in Hospitality and inform curricula planning, delivery and assessment. In particular we want to use the Mediterranean diet and the message conveyed by the Public Health Authority (and how it is implemented) as a medium to carry out a study, research and work experience placement to enable participants to explore and explains the possible influences on dietary intake of individuals in Seville and Andalusia and compare with those in York and North Yorkshire. Participants will aim illustrate the impact of each influence on the diet of individuals. Include information about health influences, lifestyle influences, economic influences, socio-cultural influences and educational influences. \r\nStaff will explore how training relates to work and how health authorities promote Health and Wellbeing through diet with the aim to gather knowledge and resources to embed in the curricula back home.  The project involves two varied groups of participants. One will be formed by staff delivering and assessing Health and Social Care and involved in the strategic planning of vocational provisions in college. The other group of participants will be learners undertaking vocational training in the field of Health and Social Care and Hospitality. Both sets of learners will explore and first hand get involved, jointly supporting each other, nutrition diet and links between nutrition and healthy living.

The students have increased their worth in the job market and we wish therefore to expand our cooperation to include Electricity and Electronics studies in addition to Healthcare. We have established a good working relationship with YC, which is famous for its prize-winning systems and good results. In the exchange period the students get to know new educational methods, live with host families and get to meet new people. This increases their self-confidence, which in turn increases their ability to take the initiative. They improve their language skills, which increases their intercultural awareness. RVG finds that our school has become more popular and parents seek more information about other exchange opportunities in vocational training. Our organization gets noticed and we experience a growing interest from other schools, parents and teachers. The exchange programme has given us the chance to improve quality development and competence in the subject. That is why we see the need to strengthen our cooperation with other countries and the EU.\r\n\r\nRVG is seeking funds for 8 students in Skin Care (Healthcare) for the whole second year (Vg2). We are seeking funds for 12 students in the Skin Care course and 12 students in Electricity and Electronics for a period of two weeks during the second year (Vg2). We are also seeking funds for two teachers in Skin Care responsible for health promotion work and practical vocational work, two teachers in Electricity and Electronics Power Current and Low Voltage, in addition to two representatives from the professional electicity and electronics trade organization .

This can improve students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 competence in working with innovative methods in a competitive job market together with school and business.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to increase interest for vocational studies at our school and to improve our educational product and make it more competitive in the job market. Our aim is to facilitate the introduction and use of innovative educational methods in cooperation with RVG and YC. The aim is also to increase intercultural and language understanding and promotes a closer cooperation between the school and the business community. \r\n\r\nYC has facilitated the use of module-based lessons. Students who are on exchange for shorter periods go through a module or part of one. Digital tools are employed in teaching and social media are used both for communication and marketing purposes to promote the exchange programme. After having passed all the modules the students who are on exchange for the whole second year (Vg2) take a final interdisciplinary test identical to the one at RVG. In practical training at school the students will be given subject-related tasks. Teachers at RVG have in cooperation with YC agreed on specific educational modules and wish to be present during parts of this process. This will give the schools the opportunity to develop innovative educational methods which will form the foundation for a more robust joint educational course. The students take part in trade exhibitions that keep them and their teachers up to date in their field. We see this as very important in ensuring quality development, enabling new discoveries while forming the foundation for promoting entrepreneurial skills and innovation in the subject. Students and teachers also take part in cultural activities, concerts and excursions to cities and the surrounding area, which all contribute toward intercultural understanding.\r\n\r\nRVG feels this project will provide inspiration to work towards an innovative and sustainable development in the trade for both students and teachers, in addition to contributing to make the students more competitive in the job market.

This development creates opportunities as well as challenges. The growing need for more relevant and competent professional expertise, changes in demographics, and increased globalisation all require new and innovative professional competences and relevant vocational education and training. International cooperation is an integral part of the Hordaland County Council\u2019s (HCC) strategy for regional development. The strategy aims to create a sustainable, attractive and competitive region, and give young people international competence, experience and shared responsibility. As these challenges are not only valid for Hordaland, the HCC see international cooperation as a tool to finding possible solutions to such challenges. The HCC is therefore using participation in different European mobility programmes, such as Erasmus+ VET mobility, as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting the needs for more relevant professional expertise and pedagogical knowledge, international experience, as well as improved foreign language competences and enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\nAs part of the HCC\u2019s strategic plans for internationalisation, international cooperation is to be an integrated part of education and training, as it adds value and quality to the training of professionals. International competences offer VET learners the opportunity to develop their abilities to actively participate in an increasing multicultural society and global world. To achieve these goals, it is an important task of the HCC to mobilise VET schools and training agencies to participate in European mobility programmes. As a regional developer, the HCC also encourage staff in public offices, enterprises and other relevant organisations to improve and strengthen their professional skills within their field of expertise, as well as developing intercultural competence and knowledge. \r\nThe target groups for this mobility project are VET learners, VET staff and other staff in institutions where training is offered. A large portion of the staff mobility projects consists of interdisciplinary groups where at least one of the participants is representing a VET organisation. The participants are key persons and play an important role in the implementation and dissemination of the projects. \r\n\r\nThe HCC is applying for: 204 VET learner mobilities, 129 staff mobilities and 64 accompanying persons.\r\n\r\nThe disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, technology, service, design and agriculture. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as health promoting work in schools, welfare technology, civil entrepreneurship, broader understanding of practices and systems in VET, as well as cooperation between VET and enterprises. \r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to strengthen the region through the acquisition of professional knowledge and expertise, develop new skills and competences, to develop prosperous local communities, improve learning outcomes for VET learners, increase recruitment and the number of VET learners finishing with a trade certificate. In addition to professional competences, it is expected that the project will increase foreign language and intercultural competences, as well as motivate participants to take part in and develop other international projects in the future. This mobility project will have both short and long term effects. It will make it possible to implement and disseminate new and innovative tools and methods to a wide variety of relevant stakeholders. It will also strengthen the quality of education and training, and the region will be able to offer activities and programmes that better respond to the needs of both the individual and the region. This will further increase the status and the attractiveness of VET.\r\nThe HCC writes the mobility application on behalf of its sending organisations, and is the coordinator for the project. The HCC has extensive experience in project cooperation and management through different EU projects (LLP, Interreg) and is well qualified to carry out this mobility project.

In brief Dga is about improving students' skills through a professionalisation of all levels of upper secondary education in Akershus. One of the main intitiatives is the \"professionalisation of teachers' through incorporating common core competencies and common attitudes in the upper secondary schools of Akershus. To \"have a culture of sharing of good practice\" and to be \"able to reflect upon their own teaching\" is among the core competencies expected of the teachers in the Akershus schools. We believe a relevant contribution to achieving these goals will be to have teachers complete staff mobility activities. The project involves sending 60 teachers from seven of the 34 upper secondary schools in Akershus on staff mobility activities in various European countries. Akershus County Council has formed a \"consortium\" of these seven secondary schools. The activities consist mainly of job shadowing at a partner school and participation in structured courses, in addition to some who will teach at a partner school abroad. The activities last from three days to one month and will take place at partner schools and professional course organisers in various European countries. The teachers will be representing disciplines such as history, foreign languages, social sciences and Norwegian.We want the teachers who participate in the project to be more reflected towards their own and others' teaching practice in addition to: - gain insight into other schools assessment practices- discover a variety of forms of teacher-student collaboration - examine how teachers and school management can gain results together - achieve up to date skills within their disciplines - be more motivated and knowledgeable staff that can spread good practice in their own school and in the county as a whole- achieving an interest in international cooperation We expect that this leads to a general increased awareness and openness about teaching and other relevant topics at each school. We also believe it can have a positive effect towards internationalisation and that it can lead to increased international activity by the schools involved. Ultimately this will benefit the pupils. Having motivated, dedicated, skilled, knowledgeable and updated teachers is the best starting point for pupils to learn more, to have more pupils complete upper secondary education and a high quality of the teaching, which are all among the main strategic goals we are working towards in upper secondary education in Akershus.", "http://www.yorkcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA101-021979_1"], ["3FR", "BI2K - Bitburg to UK", "Askham Bryan College", 8195.0, "The European Vocational Training Centre (Europ\u00e4isches Berufsbildungswerk) Bitburg is an international institution for the vocational rehabilitation, according to \u00a735 of the German Code of Social Law IX.

Knowledge of the work culture, labour market and training system of another European country will in turn lead to a quality improvement in training.Other aims are the improvement of intercultural competences, the enhancement of learning motivation and the improvement of English language skills. This should strengthen open-mindedness concerning other cultures and the ability to take the broader view.Within the context of the inclusion debate it is indispensable for staff of a European specialist training institution like the Euro-BBW to be informed about the practice of inclusion as well as inclusive didactical methods in other European countries, in order to be able to make use of the results.

Students on the exchange program have now acquired, for example, the ability to use digital tools in new situations. We also see increased levels of self-confidence, and the students say they have a better understanding of the English language, not least because they have had to communicate with their host families. This year we have had the opportunity to offer an exchange program for a group of Electricity and Electronics (EF) students. We begin in the spring term of 2016 with an exchange period of two weeks. The EF students will spend their time in classes at their cooperating school, where lessons in energy transmission will have first priority. Starting in the autumn of 2017 we wish to offer this as an exchange program on an annual basis for our second year EF students.

This goes for both shorter and longer exchange periods. The students\u2019 motivation, attendance and grades will also be taken into consideration in choosing exchange candidates.The teachers at Rud vgs and YC  and CCN have cooperated in planning educational modules so that teachers from Rud vgs will be able to be present during parts of the subject modules. This allows both the sending school and the receiving one the opportunity to develop teaching methods that provide the groundwork for stronger bonds between our two schools. After passing all modules the students will take an interdisciplinary test. Teachers from both Norway and England will be present. The teachers have developed a much improved understanding of vocational thinking though this international cooperation. This forms the basis for entrepreneurial and innovative skills in the respective subject areas. We will also enable both our long- and short-term exchange students to be awarded a Europass. In addition to English and Norwegian teachers and guidance counsellors partaking in educational activities, there will be biannual cultural activities together with the students, such as concerts and excursions to cities and local sights. The use of digital tools is integral to lessons. Social media are used for communication purposes and as part of the marketing of the exchange program. The use of digital tools is an important element in all educational programs. We at Rud vgs are experiencing an increased interest in this exchange program both at educational trade fairs and amongst parents and students who inquire about exchange programs in conjunction with vocational subjects.

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. This development creates opportunities as well as challenges. There are increasing numbers of skilled workers who now face unemployment, at the same time there is a gap between skills and the needs on the labour market. These challenges require restructuring and flexible solutions that demand more relevant and competent professional expertise and competences, new and innovative methods as well as an increasing need for more relevant vocational education and training.International cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.HCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2016-18 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between VET and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.HCC has been an active user of mobility programmes, and has sent a large number of VET pupils on mobilities every year. This year we also aspired, and worked strategically to increase the number of participants within staff mobility.By including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long term competence development. Teachers from work committees for vocational specific programmes (FAU), working across several schools, have also been included in this application. This will strengthen professional skills and competences, as well as being an important contributor in the dissemination of results. This year we have also made an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Giving mentors the opportunity to take part in a work placement together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. Sustainable development requires international cooperation across sectors, administrative levels and disciplines. There is a need to gain knowledge and insight into the disciplines that future businesses will require. The project has therefore placed emphasis on developing interdisciplinary group mobilities. It will increase the expertise and networks across different sectors, enhance value creation and innovation, facilitate better use of regional advantages and enhance restructuring to greener jobs. An example involving technology is a group from Nordhordaland (vocational school, business and municipality) that intends to visit Denmark to further develop the industrial foundation in Mongstad in a greener and more progressive direction.In this, and future projects, HCC will work more systematically to increase the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. HCC is applying for 37 mobility projects which count 173 pupils and apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 4 training offices, and 68 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 29 mobility projects which count 178 staff from 28 businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, agriculture, electricity/electronics, and tourism. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as entrepreneurship, green and blue growth, innovation, progressive healthcare, school administration, assessment, and cooperation between VET and businesses. As a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects. The majority of the pupils are under the age of 18, and it is important that they are accompanied while traveling to and from their host countries. The accompanying persons will assist the pupils while traveling and make sure the pupils settle in at both their place of accommodation and the work place.", "http://www.askham-bryan.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA116-021918_27"], ["3FR", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009207", "Askham Bryan College", 59503.0, "International activities in Luovi are based on the Luovi\u2019 s strategy. International activities aim at enhancing knowledge, skills and competences of students and staff. Mobility includes both student mobility with supporting staff and Luovi\u2019 s staff mobility. We aim to develop students ' skills in working life and to promote students' professional growth, social skills, as well as everyday living skills. The participants are second or third year students with special needs in initial vocational training. They are studying for vocational qualifications in the following fields of education:  tourism, catering and domestic services,   natural resources and environment, technology, communication and Transport sector and Social sciences, business and administration and culture.  The placements will be carried out in small groups and there will be at least one accompanying person from Luovi to support the students.  The on-the-job-learning is carried out either in the units of partner organizations or in local enterprises.  Accompanying persons support the students in carrying out the program and on-the-job-learning. In addition, they courage the students to use foreign language and to take initiative. They also need support in everyday activities when staying in a new environment, for most students this may be the first journey abroad. Receiving organizations also require accompanying persons with the group. Staff exchanges are a part of staff development and included in annual development and competence discussions between employees and superiors. The objectives are based on the Luovi priorities and exchanges enable sharing of good practices and methods of teaching and promoting employability. Work experiences of staff enhance the professional competence and knowledge of European world of work. We apply funding for students\u2019 on-the-job-learning periods with accompanying persons in Estonia, Germany, England and Italy. We also apply for staff exchanges and work experiences.Erasmus + VET Mobility Charter makes long-term planning possible. We aim at promoting equal opportunities to participate in mobility. We want to offer possibilities in all the VQs and to link internationality in all the learning by implementing international paths. The role of accompanying persons is crucial in implementation of student mobilities. We also aim at deepen the link between staff mobilities and organizational development.We utilize the experiences in further development of student and staff mobility, e.g. in preparation and choosing the on-the-job-learning places. Student and staff mobility increase internationalization at home by reciprocal activities when receiving foreign students and staff.  We aim at increasing the number of mobilities in coming year, the focus will be in student mobility, the role of accompanying person is crucial. By staff mobilities we aim at building new partnerships especially in Nordic and English speaking countries. International activities are evaluated according to Luovi\u2019 s annual plan.

We believe that enhancing VET-learners' competence and vocational skills will help them to better  understand and compete in an international market. Other important objectives for the participants are improving linguistic competence, focusing in particular on English for specific purposes (vocational English), and raising cultural awareness through a comparison and discussion of skills requirements, curricula, methods and assessments, sharing know-how, and thus reflecting on and improving our own practice. We also facilitate varied cultural activities during the mobility. Furthermore, we aim to encourage a reduction in absence and an increase in motivation by setting criteria for the selection process. Finally, we hope to recruit more students to the above mentioned vocational programmes, which is of both regional and national interest.\r\n\r\nThe participating VET-learners will prepare for the mobilty by committing to an introductory course focusing on learning objectives, expectations and individual goals, linguistic and cultural competence. The mobility itself will be a two-week work placement and vocational training at Askham Bryan College for a selected group of 9 Vg2-students each year, from our courses in agriculture, animal management, groundsmanship and landscaping, equine studies, and energy and environment studies. The participating students will have individual learning agreements specifically tailored to meet their needs, and will be closely monitored by both accompanying staff from Hvam and teachers/trainers from Askham Bryan College.\r\n\r\nThe expected/desired results of the CPLVE project are for the participants to acquire knowledge of  innovative methods, practices and standards used in agriculture, groundsmanship and landscaping, equine studies, or energy and environment studies in the UK, that they develop and improve their practical skills , and that they are able to compare, contrast and discuss differences and similarities between our two countries. Other expected results are particpants' improved linguistic competence, with a focus on vocational English, an improved ability to adapt to different working environments and requirements, and to discuss and reflect on professional and cultural differences and similarities. Finally, we expect to see results in terms of reduced absence and increased motivation for each individual participant.\r\n\r\nWe believe that providing VET-learners with updated skills and knowledge to meet an increasingly international workplace, and to be able to reflect on the differences and similiarities in requirements, methods, practices and standards, will have long term benefits for both the individual learner, the profession and society in general. We also believe that facilitating discussions and cooperation between Hvam's accompanying teachers and ABC's teachers/monitors will be of mutual benefit to both Askham Bryan College and Hvam, both in the short and long term as they will be required to share information with their respective colleagues at home.
