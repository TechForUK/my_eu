Migration to the UK from the other European Union countries was one of the top issue in the referendum debate. According to Migration Observatory, migration to the UK has increased significantly in last two decades. The countries that has been increased the number of the people that moved to UK in the \r\nlast 2 years are people from Poland (203000) and Romania (136000). There is also high migration from other 4 European Countries: Spain (74000), Italy (50.000), Hungary (46.000) and Portugal (44.000). EU Migrants are very diverse group in the UK: students (21%), family members (1 1%) and workers (68%). Unemployment is still high especially around young people and there are concerns \r\nregarding the young migrants. According to the Parliament, youth unemployment statistics in UK mention 573,000 young people  aged 16-24 were unemployed in September-November 2016. At this moment, in the context of BREXIT we don't know exactly what will happen to the migrants and how is going to be the life of the migrants after the official exist of The United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Ireland. What policies would apply to the EU Citizens after leaving from EU? It is hard to say and to find answer to a lot of questions that migrants are having in their minds. In order to prevent and to prepare better the migrants to have a life in UK, after Brexit and especially for young people that are at the beginning of their career path we need to gather and discuss the issues, get \r\nstronger together and find solutions beforehand. \r\n\r\nAs a solution we believe that the project Together for Inclusion will be a first step in our team work.\r\nThe aim is to empower young people from all walks of life (young migrants, young people with fewer opportunities and asylum seekers) to have meaningful, inclusive and culturally sensitive interactions.\r\nSpecific objectives\r\n1. To raise awareness of 20 young people regarding the specificities of youth migration during the 8 days of the youth exchange.\r\n2. To support 20 young people in having a better understanding of solidarity, tolerance and intercultural encounters during the 8 days of the youth exchange.\r\n3. To foster the personal growth of 20 participants through non-formal educational experience during the 8 days of the youth exchange.\r\n\r\nThe activities will allow them to develop special skills and attitudes such as: team work, responsibility, develop adaptability and flexibility during a 8 days youth exchange programme. Also, participants will be encouraged to initiate dialogue and promote mutual understanding during the 8 days youth exchange organised in Romania. One session will be dedicated to raising awareness regarding the opportunities that Erasmus + programme offers, in particular the value of youth mobilities and non-formal education projects.\r\n\r\nWe will use nonformal educational methods of involving the participants during the youth exchange like name games, teambuilding games, NGO market, Public cafe, workshop, awareness campaigns in the community, exercises, open discussions, research, role play, visits, debates, presentations, workshops, interviews, energisers, brainstorming.\r\n\r\nThe project will create a more  inclusive environment for the organisations involved, increase the number of people involved as beneficiaries in the youth inclusion projects and will be a beginning of understanding and developing projects that will help ameliorate of the social problems for the communities where there are young migrants.", null, "Tinevo Development Limited", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-037111_coordinator"], ["5JR", "Transition to Entrepreneurship", "Tinevo Development Limited", 17518.0, "The European Union promotes entrepreneurship as a key competence that can boost competitiveness and growth. It has highlighted the importance of advancing a European entrepreneurial culture by fostering the right mind-set and entrepreneurship related skills in the Europe 2020 strategy. \r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship and self-employment offer pathways for young people to provide an escape from unemployment. In this context, special attention is paid to the social entrepreneurship model. The social economy further contributes to several key EU objectives, including the achievement of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, high-quality employment, social cohesion, social innovation, local and regional development and environmental protection.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 2015 stressed the role of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in combatting unemployment ( European Parliament Resolution of 30 July 2015 (2014/*2236 ).\r\n\r\nAccording to the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan we need to reignite the culture of entrepreneurship in Europe and nurture the new generation of entrepreneurs and prepare them to be responsible and enterprising individuals. Investing in entrepreneurship education is one of the highest return investments Europe can make.
