These are coupled with ageing infrastructure systems, continuously growing and changing demands on the built and natural environments as well as limited financial and depleting natural resources. Until now, research has been focused on the development of proactive risk-based approaches for civil infrastructure reliability and management with benefits in improved performance, safety and cost. However, there are significant uncertainties associated with the various predictive models directly affecting the quality of the decision making mainly due to the limited amount of information available on the condition, demands and actual performance of various systems. Recently, a new generation of miniature wireless sensor platforms which utilize novel digital signal processing has emerged. These can be adopted to obtain large quantities of highly diverse sensor data that are continuously collected over a long period of time from multiple locations providing significant insight on the condition, demands and performance of the system. These developments open up a completely novel area of multidisciplinary research towards the \u2018smart\u2019 management of sustainable environment. Even though there are top research institutions working in the field of wireless sensors and others in the civil infrastructure reliability and management, most of the activity is fragmented and there is no significant activity in performing multidisciplinary structured research for developing integrated smart and dynamic systems for effective management of the built and natural environment. The aim of SmartEN is to fill this gap and push innovation through the development of an ITN network that will focus on the development and effective integration of emerging technologies targeting key application areas of current interest to the European Commission and internationally.", 183483.0, 3094833.0, "SMARTEN", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dflsystems.co.uk", null, "fp7_92822_995657859"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0RH", "Let's improve teachers' skills abroad", "St Augustine's Catholic Primary School", 51134.0, "In order to modernize,  reinforce  internal  abilities and internationalize School our \u201cPOF\u201d, for a long time-, includes participation in several Comenius projects;  organization of individual internships  for teachers abroad; adherence to International projects and continuous training project of teachers  in accordance with the lifelong learning programme to support methodological and cognitive empowerment of learners.\r\nIn this perspective the European Development Plan has been processed as part of POF  where goals and aims were set out; questionnaires were provided to detect on time staff interests and needs; structured courses, Job shadowing and  Teacher Training  were chosen because they are more responsive to the staff needs and functional at the School; modes were shared for a proper selection, preparation, follow up measures and for the evaluation and dissemination of experiences.

The headteacher and 28 teachers are the beneficiaries of the project,  both of non-language subjects and foreign language teachers, identified on the basis of:\r\n-curiosity and openness to the new CLIL methodology, which often upsets the traditional lecture and encourages to review the educational certainties to provide a more timely response to the demands of contemporary society;\r\n-manifest willingness to participate to mobility activities as they aim to exploit all the motivational and practical implications of a full immersion in the \u201cother\u201d reality. \r\nSTAGES OF THE PROJECT\r\nThe mobility project consists of the following stages:\r\n-preparation ( practical arrangements, selection of participants, linguistic/intercultural/task-related preparation of participants before departure);\r\n-implementation of the mobility activities;\r\n-follow-up (monitoring of the activities, formal recognition of the learning outcomes of participants, how to place them in the curriculum of the participants, evaluation, exploitation of the project results, dissemination of the results at different levels: of the Institute, local, national and European level for the sharing of know-how, but also to influence policy and practice).\r\nAll the project stages will be properly documented in accordance with the principles of clarity, coherence, transparency and equity.\r\nAt different stages of the EDP a prominent role has been and will be carried out by the eTwinning platform:\r\n-finding Organisations  which provide structured courses;\r\n-understanding and sharing the cultural aspects of the home and host countries and Institutions, before departure;\r\n-management of mobility through the Mobility tool, from the starting stage of the introduction of participants\u2019 names and the activities to be carried out until the generation of the final report;\r\n-participation in the Learning Events;  joining an e-twinning project together with the mobility one;\r\n-sharing experiences, socialization of results and exchange of good practices;\r\n-creation of conditions for the development of ideas for future cooperation.\r\nThe evaluation of the course will be both through self-reflection on the experience and the individual\u2019s perception of the benefits that will be derived, and through the Working Group set up within the school Institution. The Working Group, as well as the European Development Plan, will be characterized by flexibility in order to include third parties in various ways involved in the process of innovation and internationalization of the school, implementing an overcoming of self.\r\nThe impact assessment will have a very important role as it will allow the identification of point of strengths and weaknesses of the course and, ultimately, a revision of the Plan. \r\nDissemination of results will be ensured in order to make them usable by the entire educational community on the local, national and European level.

Each ring will be allocated to a partner who will use this and one or two of the Olympic values as the overarching theme to a visit by all of the partners.The 5 areas of learning identified are: Science and Maths, Language and literacy, Social sciences (History, Economics, Geography etc),Arts, and Sports. Each visit will reflect on our project motto and include a social science session with a focus on recent or current refugee crises and its impact on the host country.With our link to the Olympic values and the fact that Greece who historically founded the games has become the 'Gateway to Europe' for refugees we will also at each visit explore the impact the crises is having on this country.So for example; one visit could focus on the curriculum area of Science and Maths and the Olympic values of Friendship and Determination. The visiting teaching staff will have dedicated time within the visit to observe and discuss teaching methods, case studies and resources etc to teach Science and Maths with a focus on learning difficulties and mixed ability classes. The pupils will also join in with Science and Maths and Social Science lessons as well as activities including sports focused on Friendship and Determination.We will continue to work with our partners from our previous Comenius project as this will enable us to build upon what we have already learned and achieved from each other and through our now established friendship and respect focus on this more challenging area of teaching and support which would be difficult to achieve from the outset with new schools and teachers.We see this project as a further development to our partnership and complementary to the journey we are on together.We have already recognised that pupils in Primary schools with learning difficulties have a lower expectancy of attainment and are at risk of falling out of mainstream education and leaving school early.We believe early intervention at Primary school level to try and address these issues will be of benefit to the pupil in the long term.We acknowledge that this is not solely the responsibility of Secondary schools to address.Through this project we aim to improve these pupils expectations and attainment levels. This in turn will aid their transition to Secondary school and give them the best opportunity to succeed.Each school in the partnership has similar issues and have developed teaching methods, resources and solutions to try and address these but we have not tried to investigate this together as a partnership or look for help or support on a European wide basis. It is clear from the discussion we had about this project that the teachers could see an immediate benefit to working together and were excited by the prospect and the outcomes that could be achieved.Up to 36 pupils and 12 teachers will travel to take part directly in each of the 6 project visits. All of the schools have a growing number of pupils with a range of learning difficulties and all are from areas of deprivation in their respective countries and these visits will be fully inclusive with schools encouraged to bring mixed ability groups to the meetings.This project aims to meet and contribute to the impact of the Erasmus + programme by; Providing a greater effectiveness of activities for the benefit of our pupils; new or improved practices to cater forthe needs of disadvantaged groups and to deal with social, linguistic and cultural diversity;To inspire the development of a more dynamic, committed and professional environment inside our schools.Being prepared to integrate good practices and new methods into daily activities;  to be open to synergies with other schools active in different countries.To help with schools strategic planning of professional development for staff in line with individual needs and schools objectives.Each school and the project website will post resources that are in the public domain and provide a lasting legacy for the wider education community through the world wide web.", "http://www.staugustines.dorset.sch.uk", "St Augustine's Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024307_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DT4"}
