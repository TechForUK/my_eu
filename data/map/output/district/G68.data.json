Today the photonics global market alone is around \u20ac300 billion and Europe has established a strong position with a total share of 20%, directly employing about 290,000 people. However, the shortage of sufficient skilled labour and entrepreneurs capable of handling the highly multi-disciplinary nature of KETs remains a major problem in the EU. Tailoring of semiconductors at the nanoscale is an important enabling technology for a wide range of photonics and electronics applications in diverse areas. In the training network proposed here, a cohort of 15 early stage researchers will be trained in the full range of skills required for a career in photonics, including materials growth, device fabrication, characterisation, design, theory, and commercialisation. A carefully-chosen, well-balanced consortium of 8 academic partners, 2 full industry partners and 7 associated partners are well placed to provide the training in these skills, with European and worldwide reputations as leaders in each field. These skills will be developed within four burgeoning research areas; Semiconductor Metamaterials & Plasmonics, Dilute Nitride semiconductor nanostructures, Hydrogenated Semiconductors and Metamorphic structures. The outcomes of this enabling fundamental research are well focused to deliver advances in sources for secure communications, sensitive detectors for security applications, more efficient solar cells for energy generation, LEDs and sensors for environmental gas and bio-sensing. Each researcher will experience both academic and commercial environments thanks to the strong industrial involvement, resulting in multi-skilled, industry-focused graduates.

While the former provide energy efficient processing power for the majority of the workloads, the latter offer the possibility of customizing and adapting hardware solutions over time to specific needs. The targets of innovation in OPERA are next generation LP servers and highly parallel embedded computer systems based on ULP architectures. Adopting a mechanism for selecting the best processing element for a specific task is fundamental for achieving good levels in energy efficiency. OPERA aims at exploiting such kind of mechanisms to orchestrate both general-purpose and reconfigurable devices. The OPERA vision is to integrate ULP smart devices into a platform that uses next-generation LP servers to remotely process the data and offering cloud-based services. \nOPERA's added value to the project is the validation of the technological solutions on three different real-life workloads use-cases.

New College Lanarkshire (NCL) serves the most deprived communities in North Lanarkshire and the REALISE project is designed to increase the capacity of people living in these areas.The aim of the REALISE project is to improve the employability of 310 VET students by offering a 2 or 3 week mobility work placement opportunity that meet both their personal and vocational training needs, in line with College, Regional, Scottish Government and EU strategic objectives. It will also support VET staff either as accompanying tutors or on a teaching or training assignment to improve their teaching practice that will enhance their continuous professional development.The main objectives of the REALISE project are:\u2022 To enhance the vocational and employability skills of College and UK partner VET students to meet the needs of employers;\u2022 To develop the skills of VET staff to ensure the curriculum meets future identified skills gaps;\u2022 To ensure the project facilitates access to participants from disadvantaged backgrounds;\u2022 To deliver more effective linguistic support to improve the mobility experience;\u2022 To work with UK/EU partners on the continual improvement of the mobility experience and validation of learning.The North Lanarkshire region experiences high unemployment and significant levels of deprivation, possessing the second highest percentage of unemployed school leavers (12.9%) in Scotland. The majority of students at NCL are local and suffer from multiple, complex disadvantages and barriers to participation in training and employment; some come from families with generational unemployment; have little or no formal qualifications and have never travelled outside the UK.Through REALISE we can engage those identified as furthest from the labour market and offer them the opportunity to participate in a programme of transnational interventions that will address barriers such as lack of motivation and confidence, rising levels of unemployment among young people and adult workers with low skills.To address these issues, we will work with our 4 UK sport sending partners and 15 EU host partners in Austria, Ireland, France, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Cyprus and Spain, 4 of whom are new and have been identified by staff on mobility training assignments. All of our partners are committed to providing a high quality mobility experience by informing the design and development of training activities, incorporating good practice, arranging placements, accommodation, local transport, cultural visits, supporting accompanying staff and evaluation and dissemination of the project to ensure it meets of the participants.The REALISE programme will cover a broad spectrum of VET areas across most of our faculties and includes Health Care, Childcare, Hairdressing, Beauty Therapy, Make Up, Sport, Football, Rugby, Motor Vehicle, Motor Cycle Maintenance, Hospitality, Travel and Tourism and Computing.The impact of the mobility actions in the REALISE project will be significant in terms of adding value to the learning experience by providing VET participants the opportunity to access different types of work placements that they would not be able to access in their own region. It will also enable them to enjoy the enriching experience of living in another country and developing their knowledge, skills and competencies.A further impact at a European level is that by working more closely with our sending and host partners to continually improve the mobility experience, we can ensure the desired outcomes for participants in terms of securing employment and that all stakeholders benefit from the project activities.", "http://www.nlleisure.co.uk", "New College Lanarkshire", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023674_21"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G68"}
