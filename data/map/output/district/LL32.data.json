The participants involved are taught how to run marketing, coaching & community activities.  They acquire accredited qualifications, work experience & skills that not only help them get a better job in the future, but also increase their general life chances.  By positioning learning within the context of the Sports industry, we get commitment from participants who have historically struggled with personal motivation towards learning.  This project will further enhance that learning experience by introducing them to best practice in European Football Clubs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll 60 participants will be economically inactive or unemployed before enrolling on the programme, over the age of 16 and living in social deprived areas of Wales.  Specifically we will be targeting: 40 NEET people aged between 18 & 25 years; 10 individuals over the age of 50; 5 individuals living in supported accommodation; and 5 with challenging behaviour or learning difficulties.  Many\r\n\r\nParticipants will be from families of multi-generational unemployment, homeless, or early school leavers, and have little or no aspirations in relation to what employment could potentially do for them.  The mobility widens their horizons and raises their aspirations, and helps break the cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur objectives are that the participants go on to: \r\n\r\n   (a) take a higher level coaching qualifications to UEFA license level. \r\n\r\n   (b) undertake higher level business/marketing qualifications\r\n\r\n   (c) enter the labour market be it in the football or sports industry\r\n\r\n   (d) learn foreign languages\r\n\r\n   (e) achieve positive outcomes and life skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the European placement they will:\r\n\r\n- observe and shadow Youth Academy coaches\r\n\r\n- deliver coaching sessions to Youth teams\r\n\r\n- take part in seminars from leaders in major European football clubs (Benfica, AC Milan, Torino FC, etc) on nutrition, Psychology, Commercial development and marketing\r\n\r\n- go on stadium tours, sightseeing and watch a football match\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Erasmus+ project is finally complete, a journey will come to an end.

As such, an immersion in a European country should allow young people to better adapt themselves to the jobs of tomorrow. Live a new experience, with different professional practices in host countries, while discovering the cultural characteristics guarantee of openness and personal development should enable greater creativity to flourish in our society and European citizens. The project aims to improve youth employability by acquiring new skills carried out within the framework of a reciprocal process of sharing knowledge while being in compliance with the standards degrees. In addition, training masters and mobility referents of each MFR co- construct term objectives for each young person to discover the host company, organization and progress of tasks and responsibilities assigned. Beyond the strictly professional contributions, language learning will help to overcome shyness in practicing foreign languages and facilitate integration into family units or lodging structures. The challenge is that every young person can, after its training course, become a European citizen engaged and proud of it to create the jobs of tomorrow and improving the competitiveness of Europe.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT PROFESSIONALS IN EUROPEAN EXCHANGES TO IMPROVE OUR EDUCATIONAL AND OUR TEACHING PRACTICES\r\n\r\nIn parallel with the mobility of young people in vocational training, the FRMFR wants to mobilize teachers who have a true educational mission to youth. Their responsibilities are great in the implementation of the mobility project but also in the implementation of alternate training, educational project, monitoring alternation business / MFR and social and professional integration of young people. For this, the FRMFR aims to enable 8 teachers to live a European mobility for a week, to meet the objectives of the movement of MFR which are to boost education and teaching teams by strengthening their capacities and skills to re - update their knowledge to progress and innovate in their practices. Sharing experiences will improve the quality of relationships with European partners and particularly institutions, host companies and social partners to enable recognition of qualifications and skills acquired including non-formal situation. Comparison of training systems is rich and allows us to understand another reality that is taking support on these distancing own practices. Sharing experiences is organized at the FRMFR with the objective of creating a regional cohesion on all matters related to European mobility and thus project in terms of the valuation of these mobilities at events: General Meetings but also days of departmental or national educational groups. The impact for these teachers is to benefit from an increase in skills to better support the mobility of young people and ensure that they are more likely to benefit from this experience and offer existing and new partners coming unfailing support.
