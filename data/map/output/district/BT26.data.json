Since then they have been more than competitive reaching finals in both competitions (Heineken Cup 2011-12, and PRO12 in 2012-13).  However they have not won any silverware since 2006. For such a proud province in a nation with the stature in rugby of Ireland these are issues which need to be addressed in NI. \r\n\r\nUlster Hockey and its predecessors has a long history of involvement with the Provincial Hockey League and Irish Hockey League (league for the island of Ireland) as well as playing in European and international tournaments and league competitions. \r\n\r\nEuropean Rugby Challenge Cup is an annual European rugby union competition organised by European Professional Club Rugby. It is the second tier competition for clubs whose country's national team compete in the Six Nations Championship, as well as some teams from select other European nations.\r\n\r\nThe Mobility work programme for IIS participants will have the following clearly defined objectives:-\r\n1. To exchange and enhance player development expertise at all levels ranging from youth to intermediate to professional senior team level, from Academy age group to the Professional team.\r\n2. To give the learners exposure to the professional rugby environment of a French professional club in the Top 14\r\n3. To improve the coaching efficiencies for NI VET staff and players and facilitate the introduction, where appropriate of best practice French coaching innovations to enhance player development stage pathways and skills\r\n4. To see theory in practice through on site learning and development to enhance VET delivery\r\n5. To assist technology transfer and exchange of culture, life experiences, both nationally and internationally and work practices contrast between NI and French VET staff\r\n6. To identify new trends in recruitment, nutrition & team preparation, and team tactical play, which should be of value to the VET staff in both enhancing personal development and skills acquisition amongst the groups\u2019 individual participants\r\n7. To compare and contrast the competitive standard of rugby on an age matched basis demonstrated by FC Grenoble and Ulster rugby in NI\r\n\r\nThe key point of contact will be Bernard Jackman, FC Grenoble's Director of Rugby. FC Grenoble's preparation prior to the arrival of the mobility participants, will involve key members of staff liaising with the IIS Steering Committee and with the French club's technical coaching staff, during the logistical and schedule preparations, prior to departure.\r\n\r\nFC Grenoble's staff will assist in the implementation of the mobility work programmes and deal with all aspects including logistical arrangements, to ensure full integration into FC Grenoble's professional rugby environment and the French coaching and training regimes.", null, "Invest in Sport Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036436_coordinator"], ["6QE", "Enhancing National Sports Skills Programmes and Delivery in NI", "Invest in Sport Limited", 48164.0, "Invest in Sport Limited (referred to going forward as IIS) is a sports consultancy business incorporated in Northern Ireland (NI) which offers a range of services to sports organisations within NI, the UK, and Ireland.

In 2018 while building upon these links with our existing European partners we have also included 2 new partners which are supporting multi sport mobility experiences which will maximise the reach and impact. \r\n\r\nIntegral to achieving the objectives of all sports is improving the quality of the VET staff, now more than ever sports organisations must produce a stream of talented, enthusiastic coaches who can play their part in raising standards across the province. By providing the coaching staff working with multi sports youth, Academy, Age Grade teams and those in development roles in the community with Continued Professional Development IIIS recognises that they will be much better equipped to achieve their strategic goals. This Erasmus + mobility project is key to upskilling VET staff coaches and improving CPD opportunities as it will give the staff involved a valuable insight into European best practices in both professional and developmental aspects of both sports. In addition to developing practical experiences and skills, VET staff will benefit from improved language competencies, a greater understanding of different cultures, of international and multicultural awareness within Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Mobility work programme for IIS participants will have the following clearly defined objectives:-\r\n1.
