Automated processes for DNA analysis of large numbers of samples are now used in many of the EU member states; however the most efficient of these high throughput systems can take 3-5 days to produce DNA database-compliant profiles. In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators. Currently a small number of samples can be processed in less than 24 h but the method is labour intensive and expensive. MiDAS proposes a real-time, simple-to-operate and cost effective alternative. MiDAS will build on the current expertise of the consortium to deliver a robust, reliable instrument adaptable to the needs of multiple EU agencies. The design will allow processing of small numbers of samples at the scene of a crime, in an office environment or in the laboratory. Samples will be directly introduced to the device; no further manual involvement will be required. DNA will be extracted using magnetic bead technology and transferred to reaction chambers for quantification and amplification which will be controlled to normalise the DNA profile. The profile will be visualised following analysis through on-cartridge DNA separation and laser induced fluorescence\u2013based detection. Automated data analysis using expert systems will facilitate the timely delivery of a profile. The requirements for implementation of the instrument into the forensic process will be determined, including an evaluation of relevant legislative and data protection requirements.

The apprentices have a work contract with their employers and they apply for a work leave for the time of the on-the-job learning period abroad. Also apprentices who work as entrepreneurs are encouraged to participate on-the-job learning abroad. The length of the exchange varies from two weeks to eight weeks due to the fact that the apprentices are in work contract with the training companies.

At systemic level, we expect to awaken a modernisation of education.  \r\n\r\nThrough this project we will engage and widen the school community and reinforce our response to the main challenges of today's world in particular active participation in democratic life by realising and owning change. \r\n\r\nSchools will be developed as Learning & Thinking centres of excellence from which the wider community can play an important role in the educational standards of our young learners. By combining life skills with thinking skills and vision for the future we will inspire engagement thus raising standards amongst our pupils especially those who are considered disadvantaged.  Through these actions we will support schools in tackling lack of engagement which often leads to early school leaving. In addition we will engage local businesses to help support our local communities in gaining the appropriate skills set.\r\n\r\nWe have a combined  vision with regard to empowering and supporting  achievement amongst young people, their families and the wider community. This vision is applicable to all and will underpin all activities in order that all participants achieve their full potential.  We want to demonstrate the value that can be created when teachers give young people the practical skills to solve real challenges be.\r\n\r\nThe plan has 3 strands:\r\nStrand 1 - Upskilling Teachers, Pupils and Engaging the Community\r\nIn the initial stages of our project we upskill teachers in effective Thinking Skills in the classroom.\r\nAs this project will be largely led by pupils the next stage will be to upskill pupils in essential thinking skills.\r\nOnce trained pupils will approach members of the wider community to look at ways in which they can improve their locality and identify the skills they need in order to meet their goals.  \r\nWe have included job-shadowing and training for teachers.\r\nStrand 2- Developing Leaning & Thinking Together (LTT) schools\r\nOnce the required skill set is identified we will put into place the necessary intergenerational community training programmes in which pupils will disseminate their new skills and gaining additional skills by engaging in these events.  Wherever possible local businesses and entrepreneurs will be included sharing their expertise and offering work experience opportunities to older students. We will involve families from the school community and the wider community.\r\nTraining events will be held within the participating schools and the community will be encouraged to come together in intergenerational learning and making progress towards our goal of developing participating schools as LTT centres of excellence.\r\nTeachers from partner schools will take part in job-shadowing and pupils will take part in pupil exchange visits to partner countries. \r\nStrand 3 - Action Community Project\r\nIn this final part of the project schools will work together with the wider communities to put into play the actions they have deemed important and necessary for the wellbeing of pupils and residents in the local area. \r\nA focus will be put on the skills learned by pupils and the participating adults.  \r\nOnce complete the projects will be disseminated in multiplier events in each region.  These events will serve as a celebration of the good practice shared but also a further opportunity to encourage other schools in our regions to engage in similar activities.\r\nThere is no doubt that by cooperating together and sharing skills, experiences and competences between the partner regions the project outcomes will be significantly reinforced.

In this case, all the participants and local companies and work life are doing collaboration together to improve the quality of work, services and competences needed in the future!\r\n\r\nThe project activities will give a good picture of the process of Design Doing to the partners, but also to the students and other teachers/workers locally and support do experiments integrated to professional studies and collaboration with local companies. \r\nIn this project made there will be 2 project meetings, 5 workshops and local, national and international dissemination events. \r\n\r\nThere are three goals:\r\n1. Creating the high impact change of collaboration of the work life and vocational education organizations: the new model of collaboration, which is based on Design Doing (not only Design thinking), sharing the expertise to each other and creating the collaboration culture.\r\n\r\n2. Learning the Design Doing process, integrate it in VET and learn how to use it in companies. Participants will have experience of sharing the skills in action when working with customers and they will get competence and courage to do experiments. The main idea is keep the experiments simple with reasonable costs, use suitable tools and save time, money and get results.\r\n\r\n3. Improving the efficiency of work by LEAN thinking and learning simple methods and principles of it, then adopting these to daily procedures of teachers/entrepreneurs.  During the project we are figuring out if the LEAN 5S-principles can be used as framework for experiments.\r\n\r\nThis project and learning activities are meant to teachers/entrepreneurs/workers to improve their skills and competence in development, but also some students who help us to create model for all fields of studies.  Teachers acts as coach when doing workshops tasks with students and get ideas also from student. During the activities/work shops we will reach many kind of work life partners (secondary) in each countries and get also familiar with business in European region. \r\nThe main results are: \r\n1. Educational model and tools of Design Doing in each partner language.\r\n2. Improved collaboration with work life. \r\n3. Guide videos of collaboration and experience of partners and students. \r\n4. Example of experiments done, improved services and products, examples how to LEAN teachers/entrepreneurs work in practice.\r\n\r\nPartners in this project are versatile.
