The improvement of their transversal competences will be crucial as well: using ICT tools to search and present information, developing entrepeneurship to develop activities with a real and useful purpose, reflecting on their own learning process, etc. \r\nTeachers also needs new experiences, methodologies and techniques to teach languages.  They will prepare didactic sequences and tasks related to sociocultural aspects and intercultural awareness, sharing them during the transnational meetings and on the Internet to later use them with the students.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES AND TOPICS\r\n1- Get to know and value the sociocultural diversity showing attitudes of respect and tolerance.\r\n2- Improve linguistic competence of second languages in real contexts.\r\n3- Use ITC tools autonomously to search for information, analyze it and present it.\r\n4- Transfer, learn and apply quality teaching methods.\r\n5- Foster dialogue and individual or group decision taking.\r\n6- Foster artistic creativity.\r\nWe will focus on the preparation and implementation of integrated tasks taking the following topics into account:\r\na- Culture and creativity: the nucleus of the activities will have to do with the cultural knowledge of the countries involved (festivals, music, gastronomy, art, sport, etc.).\r\nb- Second language teaching and learning: students/teachers will use the languages they learn/teach: Spanish, English, Italian and some German.\r\nc- ICT \u2013 New technologies \u2013 Digital competence.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nMost of our 12-17 year-old students find few opportunities to practise the language they learn in their environment (three out of four schools are in small towns, and two of them suffer the difficult economic crisis in Spain and Italy), with little or no contact with native speakers. than 200 participants will benefit from this Project, indirectly more than 2000.\r\nTeachers want to increase their abilities in the second language classroom, learning new pedagogical approaches, preparing integrated activities that may favour its implementation among their students and looking for better methods to evaluate them.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n- Website to publish our activities and results.\r\n- Twinspace to communicate among students, create a logo, a song, a calendar, etc.\r\n- Travel guide, which will be used by students in their mobility activities.\r\n- Integrated didactic sequences (two per partner) and others about music, sport, art and gastronomy.\r\n- Rubric system to evaluate the project.\r\n- Article about second language teaching by comparison of methods.\r\n- Multilingual dictionary with useful expressions.\r\n- Boardgame about sociocultural aspects.\r\n- Benefic calendar on festivities and traditions.\r\n- Mobility activities: shadow teaching (Spanish teachers in the UK, Austrian teachers in Spain, Italian teachers in Austria and English teachers in Spain) plus students\u2019 activities (art in Austria, sports in Italy, music in Spain and gastronomy in the United Kingdom). There will also be immersion actviities to participate in integrated tasks or to participate in normal classes.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nWe will present integrated tasks related to sociocultural aspects and different subjects of the curriculum. We will deal with project-based learning, problem-based learning, gamification, blended learning, etc. These tasks will have a communicative approach and will be developed in cooperative or colaborative groups.  The situations will make our students take decision, develop entrepeneurship and ICT use. Teachers will learn new teaching methods, share activities, experiences, resources, etc. They will also take part in shadow-teaching activities to observe and participate in the partners\u2019 schools, in which they will prpare didactic sequences taking their students' necessities into account.

Cooperation to shape an all renewable vision for Europe by 2050.\" \r\n \r\nInspired by the hardrainproject\u2019s web of energy (www.hardrainproject.com/web_of_energy ) this project will explore how our \r\nactivities and attitudes will have to be altered if we want to change from carbon energy - coal, oil and gas - to renewable energies: solar, wind, hydro, wave and geothermal energy generation.   \r\nThe 2050 vision requires simultaneous and coordinated progress on many levels as well as a cooperation between governments, \r\nindustry and consumers. Are we ready to seize the day and collaborate on a solution which is European-wide? \r\nFollowing new guidelines on the optimization of transnational energy flows which were published in April 2014, our project aims at \r\nbuilding and strengthening cooperation among schools from different European countries. We hereby want to offer adolescents \r\nfrom different regions a profound, long-lasting and consequently European perspective on two topics which will shape many \r\ngenerations to come: sustainability and renewable energies. The central aim of the project is to offer students and teachers a first-\r\nhand encounter with different technologies that use renewable energies. Different countries offer different ways of implementing \r\nrenewable energies. Getting to know these various ways of using renewable energies on-site will broaden our students' horizons \r\nand thus lead to a sustainable and long-lasting learning effect. They will learn in which ways their everyday behaviour has an effect on the global environment by actively learning about the connectedness of different European regions and their respective use of \r\nrenewable energies. Thus they will learn not regard themselves as isolated individuals from a certain region, but as active and \r\neffective European agents for change. They will improve their language skills through different communication forms (face-to-face \r\ncommunication, email, eTwinning, homepages, skype, facebook, google docs etc.) methodical skills (preparing presentations, \r\nconducting workshops, designing leaflets etc.) and gain a deeper understanding of the shared European heritage and responsibility. \r\nOwing to the past Comenius project in which the partners from Germany, England and Norway took part, there is a common \r\nground from which the new project can be launched. The addition of Portugal as a fourth partner will enrich our project and lead \r\nto even more comprehensive discussions and results. Since all schools are situated in UNESCO Geoparks in rural areas and are \r\nspecialized in Geography and Science, we can all benefit from the different national ways of approaching the topics of sustainability and renewable energies. Due to already established external partnerships such as affiliations with regional companies (e.g. ENO, Steiff in Buchen) or research institutions (e.g. South West Energy Centre, Paignton, Aveiro University Campus) we can conduct highly \r\nefficient exchange trips for five students and two teachers to the different countries where we are planning to hold lectures, take part in workshops, conduct student presentations, attend discussions etc.   \r\nThe possible stages of the project (raising awareness within & between our communities, challenges we are facing now and in the \r\nfuture, responses: from local to national solutions, a web of energy - a 2050 all renewable European supergrid?) could serve as \r\nmultiplication activities for the teaching staff (internal training programs, school conferences on relevant topics etc.) as well as for \r\nstudents (the projects topics will be presented in different subjects). Besides using our findings in school contexts, we are \r\nplanning to publish our results through different media, on our homepages and in permanent exhibitions in our school buildings as well as in communal buildings. This will offer the chance to continuously evaluate our procedures and share our thoughts with the other partners based on feedback sessions. Additionally, we are not only planning to build models of photovoltaic systems, but also to shoot video clips about the individual school projects which will be combined to comprise a longer film about our conjoined \r\nproject.  \r\nThe students will thus acquire expert knowledge about renewable energies, improve their language skills as well as gain access to universities and other external partners such as companies or political boards and parties. Most importantly, they will actively participate in formulating and realizing the European vision of sustainability and energy efficiency. They will act as active multipliers for the project's central aim by not only learning about renewable energies, but also integrating them into their daily life and thus influencing their social environment. The project's scope reaches far beyond the walls of our schools and will contribute to a coordinated European step towards sustainability and renewable energies.", "http://www.churstongrammar.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA219-035486_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5AY", "APPLIED GENOMICS LTD", 7851.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_27360", 2017]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["9HW", "RA9", "Brixham Hospital - Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TQ5"}
