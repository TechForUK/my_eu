We would like to teach students, their hardworking or less educated parents as well as grandparent involved in diffetent stereotypes healthy way of living. We would like them to learn some good habits such as bringing healthy lunches, ability to behave in difficult situations (first aid trainings), maintain proper posture and live with agreement with surrounding. We want them stop wasting natural sources as well as food. They will be taught how to process food, how to distinguish healthy from unhealthy, how to understand food labels and what different symbols mean. We would like to encourage students to spend time outdoors and play some interesting games which will be presented by each country. On the other hand we will not discourage them from using ICT techniques, but they will be provided with some ideas how to use it properly without too much risk. The idea is that students will take all habits home and contaminate adults to healthy lifestyle. the project is a possibility to open our local community into world to share ideas and experiences in order to abolish stereotypes and support each other. All of participants - students, parents, staff will improve their social and language skills while hosting or taking part in school activities. There are about 2000 students from 7 schools all over Europe who will take part of the project. Some of them come from big cities or capitals (Ankara, Dijon, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a), some of them are representatives of smaller communities (Szeghalom, Burton-upon-Trent), so we can exchange our ideas, ppoints of view of working, teaching and learning in different situations, facing different problems. In such a group there are about 500 students with different difficulties, mostly financial that influence their lives. For them such a project is the only possiblity to learn and visit foreign countries. the project is going to give the chance for everyone: those talented in art, music, sport or ICT. Different types of activities (dramas during school assemblies, drawing, preparing brochures and posters, taking part in workshops about sport activities, preparing food, designing clothes) apply to students' multitalents and give them a chance to discover them or improving. the most relevant result will be connected with preserving habits that will be sustained during the project and after it. Moreover a lot of materials, lesson plans, brochures, DVD's will be a good point in future teaching about health in a broad sense. On the basis of exchanged ideas and experiences innvoative programmes will be created (in P.E and language section) which will implement the schools curricula. We will share our ideas through internet,schools and the project webapages, local media and during Edu Week or Edu day that will be held during the project.", "http://www.holyrosary.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA219-016839_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DE15"}
