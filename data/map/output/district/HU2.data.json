The \u201cSzeksz\u00e1rdi Szakk\u00e9pz\u00e9si K\u00f6zpont Szent L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szakk\u00e9pz\u0151 Iskol\u00e1ja \u00e9s Koll\u00e9giuma\u201d understood and seized the opportunity of the international mobility right from the beginning and completed several mobilities since. They have gained positive experience, which was continuously shared with the other member institutions enabling each of them to participate in the realization of these goals. Our school is a \u201cTalent Point\u201d, which means that we support the students to obtain useful trades and skills. Our success was presented by Mr. Tordai P\u00e9ter in \u201cGenius nights\u201d with the help of Tempus Foundation.Our purposes are the following:1. To gain experience in international trade in order to incorporate it into the training-learning process2. To secure the validation of the accessed work experience (ECVET)3. To develop the competences of the apprentices to prepare them for work in the international labor market4. To promote a wider appreciation of life through the trade and to create opportunities in the social mobility5. To provide an opportunity to the most talented trainees to gain international experienceThe main goal of our project was to provide an opportunity for our students and our colleagues to visit a Spanish-speaking and an English-speaking region. Why? Because the internship offers a new perspective for our students for a better life, a better work environment, and new methods, knowledge, experience for our teachers. They obtain knowledge that they would not be able to obtain within the frames of a regular education, everyday working routine. They will be able to stand on their own feet, work alone or in a team, make decisions and adapt. They will become much more self-confident, they will trust their knowledge and they use the language effortlessly. They will get to know the receiving country\u2019s culture and technology. They will be able to see that an internship is not about doing menial work, but much more a chance to be taken seriously. They often receive praise, which is extremely motivating for them. The only prospective for Hungary is a close cooperation of its schools with trainee places. That is the only way to solve Europe\u2019s huge shortage of professionals. These over the border programs offer a huge opportunity for our students and will definitely increase employment. We have to get acquainted with new methods, take them home and use them. We must learn from others. Let\u2019s bring Europe home.This project is a combination of challenge, ability and connections. If we provide a challenge for our youth that is adequate to their level and gives them a chance to connect with others and do something useful with others, they will feel magnificent; hence they will want to work. In an international student group every opportunity is given. Diversity and friendships across Europe contribute to solidarity among young people. It is very good to see how international projects bring young people and adult teachers/trainers closer. It is based on these thoughts that we take our students to Valencia (Spain). We plan the training for 30 days, with 18 students in Valencia (1October-30 October 2016)and 8 days (4 March- 12 March 2017) with 12 teachers in Witney (UK) for a job shadowing experience.The selection of the receiving partner countries was based on our economical and professional needs and specialties, additionally past experiences and connections between the receiving and sending partners were considered. The teachers help in the continuous communication between the students and the parents. Their role is manifold, it spans from organizing the students\u2019 everyday life abroad to permanently assessing and evaluating their performance. The number of teachers (2) is proportional to the number, gender and age of the students.We would like to complete the dissemination of the project in a wide social and professional circle. Besides the impact results of the project we also expect increased efficiency in our school\u2019s enrolment and weight to its profile as a training provider.", "http://www.ltd-oxford.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-HU01-KA102-022488_2"], ["8LA", "International Youth Volunteering Programme", "The British Red Cross Society", 217833.0, "The British Red Cross International Youth Volunteering Project's mission is to provide high quality long-term international volunteering experiences to 29 young people from across Europe, aged 18-30.
