This is (in part) due to the current manufacturing technologies that are based on subtractive processing that are expensive, wasteful and energy intensive, making manufacture in the EU economically and environmentally unfeasible. Printed electronics is set to revolutionise the electronics industry by enabling direct, additive processing that significantly reduces capital and operating costs as well as massively reducing process hazardous chemical waste and energy.\nCurrently the EU dominates the innovation and technological know-how in printed electronics. It is very important that this intellectual capital that Europe developed is translated to direct economic benefits by ensuring that manufacture is retained within the EU. However, there are barriers that are preventing widespread adoption of printed electronics including the availability of cost effective, high performance electronic inks, lack of awareness of end-users and lack of integration of individual printed components into large systems.\nPLASMAS directly builds on world-leading nano-materials, printing and display device technologies developed and patented by the consortium members. Our consortium is unique in that it covers the entire supply chain and also in terms of its ambition. PLASMAS directly addresses the current commercialisation barriers by demonstrating the capability of technology (based on novel copper and silicon inks with favourable cost to performance ratios) through development of printed circuit boards and printed logic as well as displays with printed copper and silicon-based back panels and established \u201cself-emissive\u201d OLEDs and \u201creflective\u201d low power Electro-Chromic elements. As a consequence of the limitations in the availability of printed silicon an emphasis will be put on the development of printed grid electrodes for OLEDs and OPV applications as well as printed R2R fabricated RFID antenna structures.

Furthermore, they developed comprehensive algorithms and procedures for phase extraction from shearography fringe patterns and for compensating the WTB rigid body motion during inspection.\n\nDASHWIN represents the first time a shearography system will be used for inspecting WTBs.

Pupils will make their own bookworms which will grow in length with every book they read throughout the project. \r\nCountries will exchange traditional stories, fairytales and legends from their culture with accompanying art work and versions written by the children. We will invite authors into schools and visit printing and publishing houses. Children will study promotion strategies to gain basic knowledge and impressions about the production and sale of the books we read. Children \u201cgo back in time\u201d interviewing adults about what they read and played with when they were children, comparing their findings with today\u2019s childhood and putting their results in \u201ctime machines\u201d.  \r\nPupils will choose and present their book heroes and invent their own hero, based on their personal values and ideas. In creative and cooperative work they will put them together in fantasy stories, design costumes and props for them and play their scenes on stage. They will dress up as their hero for a show during a mobility and compete in story based sporting activities. Through these different and motivating activities our pupils will improve their own reading skills in combination with other skills such as creative writing in their mother tongue and in English, researching about project topics, using media, presenting work, producing creative artwork and drama etc. \r\nDirect contacts between our classes, individual children and teachers via the eTwinning portal will support language learning and intercultural education. Allowing our children to work, play, communicate and visit each other will strengthen their understanding of the everyday life of children, families and schools in other EU-countries. By taking part in transnational learning activities they will experience firsthand family life and culture by staying with host families, giving the children a real life focus and purpose for their project work. The students will get into contact with different European languages and use English as the project language for communication and presentation. These transnational activities will be intensive working time and highlights in our partnership, presenting and evaluating results and celebrating success.\r\nFor our teachers we will encourage an intensive exchange of teaching methods and styles and share good practice, especially in the fields of reading and literacy, project work, creative thinking and media use. Our teachers and children will cooperate closely, plan and carry out project work together and share its results. We will involve parents, local communities and other partners. We will make progress and results visible on our project website, the regular Bertie Magazine and the eTwinning portal as well as in displays and presentations at school.\r\nFinally we will sum up our outcome in a reading curriculum which will give guidelines and methods about how we can improve our pupils\u2019 reading skills leading to a sustainable and high quality educational work.", "http://tregoze-pri.swindon.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE03-KA219-013844_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 162176.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2016_40516", 2016], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 81179.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2016_49175", 2016], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 81024.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2016_49227", 2016], ["7BD", "CONFEDERATION OF PAPER INDUSTRIES LIMITED", 486.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_20419", 2017], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 97299.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2017_48053", 2017], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 87215.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2017_49403", 2017], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 87150.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2017_49421", 2017], ["5WB", "PRECISION VARIONIC INTERNATIONAL LIMITED*PVI", 43613.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_57970", 2017], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 43429.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2017_58444", 2017], ["8YF", "WRC PLC*", 30093.0, "Contributing to a greener and more resource-efficient economy and to the development and implementation of Union environmental policy and legislation (07.02.01)", "fts_2017_62014", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SN5"}
