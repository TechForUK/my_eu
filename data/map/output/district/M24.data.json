The creation of a complete '3-D capable' chain is expected to follow a similar path. The media industry knows that astonishing the public is still a route to large audiences and financial success. <br/>2020 3D Media proposes to research, develop, and demonstrate novel forms of compelling entertainment experience based on technologies for the capture, production, networked distribution and display of sounds and images in three-dimensions. 2020 3D Media will add extra dimensions to Digital Cinema and create new forms of stereoscopic and immersive networked media for the home and public spaces. The goal is to research and develop technologies to support the acquisition, coding, editing, networked distribution, and display of stereoscopic and immersive audiovisual content to provide novel forms of compelling entertainment experience in the home or public spaces. The users of the resulting technologies will be media industry professionals across the current film, TV and 'new media' sectors to make programme material addressing the general public.<br/>The key will be the creation of technologies for creating and presenting 'surround video' as a viable system, based on recognised standards.

We have 334 pupils on role, aged between 3 and 11.\r\n\r\nFollowing a significant change of staff, the new foreign languages subject coordinator conducted a staff and pupil audit to assess the status of French; she found that:\r\n\r\n- school leaders and teachers value the importance of language learning\r\n- pupils enjoy their French lessons\r\n- pupils have made good progress in the 2 years since the introduction of the new curriculum\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\n- all staff feel they need to increase their personal French skills to ensure pupils continue to progress\r\n- the newer members of staff in particular lack confidence in their ability to teach French \r\n- French sometimes slips from the timetable in the term when the consultant is not in support\r\n- most staff lack first-hand experience of French culture \r\n- pupils want to learn about and communicate with children in France\r\n\r\nTo address these issues we are launching a 2 year Erasmus+ staff mobility project to give 6 teachers and teaching assistants the opportunity to take part in a programme of immersion courses. We expect this to:\r\n\r\n-  develop teachers personal knowledge and proficiency of French language, cultures, traditions and heritage \r\n-  train teachers relatively new to teaching to become more proficient in the teaching of French \r\n-  broaden experiences of cultures and beliefs of the children \r\n-  offer opportunities to the disadvantaged children to increase their life experiences \r\n-  ensure that the children become proficient in the French language including reading, writing, speaking and listening \r\n-  establish an effective relationship with a partner French primary school \r\n\r\nThe impact we expect is:\r\n- Participants will have higher levels of competence and confidence and greater cultural understanding \r\n- Participants will have enhanced their professional profile\r\n- The subject coordinator will have developed project management skills and extended her subject leadership skills\r\n- This will provide better learning experiences for the pupils \r\n- Pupils will be corresponding with French children\r\n- The school will have an enhanced European dimension \r\n- there will be a bank of authentic cross-curricular resources\r\n\r\nOur project results will be disseminated within our school community and beyond to other local schools and shared at national conferences.", "http://www.stthomasmorerc.co.uk", "St Thomas More Roman Catholic Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036342_coordinator"], ["2GL", "Teaching & Learning of Spanish Language & Culture", "Cardinal Langley RC High School", 1705.0, "The course title is Teaching & Learning of Spanish Language & Culture. The context of this project relates to our school, Cardinal Langley RC High School, being in a relatively deprived area of North Manchester with a large proportion of disadvantaged students with low aspirations. The study of languages in UK schools is becoming more and more important in our global economy and in order to offer our students the best possible opportunities for a future in the global market, it is vital that we have staff with expertise and competences in a European context. We wish for all of our languages teaching staff to feel confident in delivering all language options at all levels, so that the provision of languages within our curriculum is enhanced. Our objective is to provide one new member of staff with the skills and knowledge to teach Spanish beyond KS3. This member of staff currently teaches French up to KS5 and has demonstrated a commitment and enthusiasm to developing language competencies and sharing best practice. The activities which will take place during the project are part of a full-week immersion course. The course encourages the use of a creative teaching approach and includes specific sessions on integrating ICT in language teaching. It also includes sessions to develop partnership work with teachers from within Europe, as well as other activities available under the Erasmus+ Programme. During the week attendees will be encouraged to reflect on and develop their planning skills and will be tasked with working together to develop their own teaching resources. These will be shared within the group and uploaded to a public website so that teachers within the wider educational community can use them. This work forms an integral part of the dissemination activities attendees will undertake on their return home. Throughout the week and consistent with a full immersion\r\napproach, a variety of teaching and learning sessions will be delivered with specific teaching and learning aims. These include language and methodology-specific classes, cultural sessions and cultural visits with examples of activities to use with pupils, a visit to a school for observation of practice and an opportunity to make links for future partnership work. The project will support the professional development of our member of staff, and impact on their confidence and knowledge of current and up-to-date language, culture, and teaching methods. These new skills will have an impact on our learners and our school. For example the visits to educational establishments abroad will provide opportunities for networking and establishing links, which may give us the opportunity to set up future exchanges and projects helping to develop a more European dimension to our school. There will also be an expected impact on curriculum content, particularly in the languages department. We will have a more engaged member of staff who will share the experience with a maximum number of staff and students. The longer term benefits will be that our students will broaden their horizons and develop a global awareness and an ability to participate in a European market.", "http://www.clrchs.co.uk", "Cardinal Langley RC High School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036424_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M24"}
