The target group is SMEs and specifically those from the 50 \u2013 150 employee level. Within this target group, those organisations with high growth potential will be prioritised. The primary development focus will be on operation models which reflect the High Mix Low Volume (HMLV) manufacturing environment which companies must migrate towards in order to survive and compete. The project will address competitiveness issues relating to European SMEs, the lack of take up of productivity methodologies such as Lean and Six Sigma and the changing nature of the business environment in which SMEs operate. A comprehensive response will be generated which will deliver and demonstrate solutions for SMEs in relation to strategic planning, cultural and structural issues preventing adoption of best practices, modified lean and six sigma tools tailored for SME businesses, virtual manufacturing and collaboration methods, value chain enhancement methods, process modelling and simulation tools, implementation methodologies within SME organisations, design for environment support tools and workflow process development tools for SMEs. In addition, a special task will pilot and test how lean, six sigma and environmental philosophies can be integrated into school curricula in order to influence the mindset of future employees towards best practice business philosophies. The manufacturing model will be thoroughly tested through application in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors and also within several countries.

This model will help companies to compete more effectively at the national, European and global level by encouraging them to adopt sustainable business practices.", "FutureSME is carrying out research into the needs of SMEs, resulting in the development of a business model and project architecture. The model has identified four areas of capability that are required by a business in order for it to be successful. These include strategic, operational, managerial and adaptive capabilities, of which the adaptive capability is the most important for ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nTransforming an SME into an adaptive enterprise is the job of the FutureSME architecture. This comprises a web portal, business diagnostics, resources to help with implementation, and a structured programme leading to accreditation. The business diagnostics have already been implemented for some end-user partners, while a self-assessment version is under development.\n\nThe support environment contains a number of productivity methodologies such as Lean materials, a life-cycle tool set and 6 Sigma (business management strategy) for SMEs. A modified architecture for schools has also been piloted by the FutureSME initiative that will encourage youngsters to develop a best practice business philosophy.\n\nTools, techniques and the delivery platform developed in FutureSME will enable organisations to boost their ability to adapt. The manufacturing model will be rigorously tested in SMEs and other companies across a number of manufacturing sectors within several countries.\n\nResults from FutureSME will be disseminated across the EU helping small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe develop a sustainable business model.

In Carolside Primary, we currently deliver French in a modular way and have already focused curriculum development work on our chosen \u2018plus 2\u2019 language, Mandarin.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of our project are:\r\n\u2022 To improve the learning and teaching of French in Carolside Primary School.\r\n\u2022 To improve teacher confidence in delivering French throughout the school day\r\n\u2022 To create new resources, implement different teaching methods and enhance the use of ICT to engage pupils in language learning.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 key members of staff who are involved in this application:\r\n\u2022 A current nursery class teacher, fluent in French and has experience of delivering the French curriculum to pupils working at Early, First and Second level of the curriculum. \r\n\u2022 A Primary 6 class teacher who has run the school's Languages Club for the past two years and has experience of delivering modern language lessons in Mandarin to pupils working at First and Second level of the curriculum. \r\n\u2022 A Primary 7 class teacher who has undertaken additional training in teaching French in the primary classroom and has been responsible for delivering the French curriculum to Primary 6 and Primary 7 classes in the school. \r\n\u2022 A Primary 6 class teacher who has undertaken a research project on the Scottish Government policy of 'Languages 1 + 2' and has begun additional French training this year.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this project, and after having carried out detailed planning with staff and pupils at the school, we will attend an immersion course in Lyon specifically designed for primary teachers. This course will enable us to learn language specific skills and teaching pedagogy as well as to increase our cultural awareness of France. On returning to school, it is our intention to pass on these skills and knowledge to our colleagues in school and allow our pupils to benefit from our deeper understanding of French and life in France. \r\n\r\nWe envisage there to be a measurable change in the way French is delivered across the school and nursery as a result of our project. We aim for French to be embedded in daily teaching, for French and French culture to be linked to stage specific learning experiences, for the perception of language learning to be improved and for the school and local community to see language learning as a vital life and work skill for pupils as they progress to higher education. In the longer term, the school will be seen to be an example of how language learning can be successfully integrated in to daily teaching. Pupils will be confident in learning language(s) and therefore be equipped with the skills needed to be employed in a world where language skills are becoming essential.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/er/Carolside/about-2/", "Carolside Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035736_coordinator"], ["8JU", "Open Windows II", "Busby Equitation Centre", 89648.0, "In \"VE San Ignacio de Loyola\" we feel the need to encourage our students to \"open windows\" and leave their comfort zone as a way of personal growth. Addressing the challenges that may arise in their personal or professional life, will make them develop new skills and also learn new abilities; and by overcoming these challenges, they will also overcome their fears and, by doing so, will be more confident.\r\n\r\n1. Context and Background:\r\nIn the line of work described above, our Center has been working with the Wimbledon Village Stables (WVS) for several years in the training of instructors. The basis of our relationship is centered on the complete end to end personal and professional development of the student: as a person, rider and instructor. This is a shared vision that is enriched with the particularities of their different nationalities.\r\nThe good relationship maintained with WVS and the excellent work carried out by our students who participated in the OWI, have opened new doors for us, and in this project we incorporated two partners in Scotland (Busby Equitation Center and Scottish Equestrian Center).\r\nWhat has driven us to strengthen previous collaboration, so that it could also reach our students, is to realise the enormous benefits, not only for the maturity they acquire, but also for the opportunity to learn in one of the cradles of horse riding and, more specifically, the discipline that we practice and teach, the English Discipline.\r\n\r\n2. Goals / Targets:\r\nThe goals we intend to achieve with the launch of OWII are:\r\n\u2022 Improve students' language  skills.\r\n\u2022 Develop and Improve students personal autonomy and decision making.\r\n\u2022 Promote European identity and awareness of belonging to European citizenship.\r\n\u2022 Encourage knowledge exchange and collaboration among European companies.\r\n\u2022 Make Erasmus+ been known as a program that generates added value to VE (Vocational  Education).\r\n\u2022 Associate San Ignacio corporate VT image with the European image promoted by the Erasmus+.\r\n\r\n3. Activities:\r\nWe have planned 25 mobilities:\r\n-  4 VET-SHORT, 16 VET-PLONG. For the realization of FCT in WVS, Busby Equitation Centre y Scottish Equestrian Centre For the accomplishment of the Training Module in WVS of the students taking a Medium Degree VE in Conduction of Physical Sport Activities in the Natural Environment (TECO).\r\n- 3 MOBILITIES OF PERSONNEL FOR TRAINING. For training by means of job-shadowing activity.\r\n- 2 VET-PADV. For the planning, organization and estructuring of the stay and learning for the students and teaching staff.\r\n\r\n4. Methodology:\r\nFor the development of this project \"Open Windows II\" (OWII) it has been necessary to answer the following questions:\r\n\u2022 Where will OWI be developed? (Context and Background).\r\n\u2022 What do we intend to achieve? (Goals).\r\n\u2022 What tactics and strategies will we use? (Methodology).\r\n\u2022 What resources will we have? (Resources).\r\n\u2022 How will we assess OWII's execution? (Evaluation).\r\n\r\nWe have started from the knowledge of the environment and we have analysed the initial situation in order to carry out a careful analysis of the needs; since this depends on the use of participation in the Erasmus+ Program.\r\nWe have also paid special attention to the relationship between objectives and planned activities.  And finally we have aimed to ensure a clear and lasting impact in our Centre.\r\n\r\n5. Results and expected impact:\r\nThe achievement of the established goals will suppose a significant change in our educational community. By focusing on methodologies aimed at enhancing students' social and personal skills that will help us to improve their training, we hope to correct the following weak points which we have detected:\r\n\u2022 Poor language skills and poor student maturity.\r\n\u2022 TECO\u00b4s Degree poor employable level .\r\n\u2022 Traditional poor image of the VE, for being considered as a \"plan B\" of the educational system.\r\n\r\n6. Long-Term Benefits:\r\nAn important improvement in the training of students will be achieved, both in academic-professional and personal performance, that we sincerely expect to redound to an increase in the number of students interested in participating in European Projects. \r\nOther medium-long term benefit is to apply the same or similar scope to other educational stages of the School (Secondary and High School), so that a higher level of internationalization is achieved, which is one of the core values of our Centre.\r\n\r\nSan Ignacio de Loyola is part of the BEDA Program, which consists in a gradual implementation of a bilingual Spanish-English teaching at the School. Participation in this Erasmus+ will contribute to access to level 2 of this Program (Bilingual Excellence Model).\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the success of this project will be a crucial point in order to complete the process that we have recently begun to certify our School in the Excellence and Quality Model EFQM.", "http://www.busbyequitationcentre.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-049787_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G76"}
