Globalisation and internationally operating companies have a great demand for qualified students whose command of English is fluent enough to cope with international challenges. Naturally these young people and their teachers and trainers need to build on their basic language skills by getting the chance to use English in a practical context during the training process. It is here where our project can contribute most. Trainees who have not yet had the opportunity to participate in European exchange programmes in particular will benefit from our project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen in 2004/2005 English was introduced as a compulsory subject in vocational business schools for students in retail sales and office administration, this was the starting point for our school to tailor a special language learning programme for this target group alongside their normal English lessons. Initially an exchange programme was designed in the form of a three week college course to meet these students\u00b4 needs by focussing on practical English usage and intercultural competence at the same time. However, as our students strive for work experience it very soon became clear that workplacements abroad would be of even greater use to them. So the altered training programme that has been established since enables the participating students to do internships as well as college training. Our project \u201cWorkplacements in the UK\u201d offers a three week stay abroad to 20 students of our school who are currently in their vocational training. Students of all departments can apply, as long as they demonstrate a basic knowledge of English and show motivation. The same qualifications are required of members of staff who want to take part in the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring their three week stay in Brighton (UK) participants are expected to develop their communication and language skills both in general and in their special professional field. In a kick-off seminar in the first three days of their stay the participants receive individual training sessions purposefully designed to meet their individual needs. This will enable them to cope with their two weeks employment in the various English businesses, which will be organized for them well in advance. To add to their intercultural competence, students will be accommodated with English host families and thus will experience every day English life throughout their stay. On the last day of the programme there is an opportunity for reflection and evaluation. Along with the Europass, all participants will get a certificate of attendance from our organizing partner Workplacements UK, and a qualifying employer\u00b4s reference from their individual work places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking part in this project helps young people to develop their personality, to increase their self-confidence and to broaden their occupational horizons as the programme requires great flexibility and the readiness to handle an unfamiliar environment. Thus the ability to adapt to the constantly changing challenges of the working world is improved. Furthermore we hope the project will encourage students\u00b4 interest in further education and qualifications while still in training and in the long term to encourage them to seek employment abroad.\r\n\r\nEnabling our staff to participate in the project is a genuine part of our school\u00b4s continuing personnel development. In the course of our policy of developing an international focus this programme will eventually lead to an even wider opening of the \u201cBeruflichen Schulen Wittelsbacher Land\u201d to the outside \u201cworking\u201d world. Practical work experience abroad for our training personnel will help to implement the European focus in our lessons and to encourage this ethos in our students, who live in a Europe which is growing closer day by day. In this context the opportunities that are offered by the Workplacement-Project are ones that will enable our students and staff to meet the challenges of the 21st century.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000081_1"], ["7LR", "Qualit\u00e4t in der beruflichen Bildung", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 52477.0, "Resulting from the advancement of global networks and ongoing internationalisation activities in combination with the growing stress of competition in the labour market, general professional competencies no longer suffice. The aim of the mobility project is to counteract these developments and to help trainees enhance their employability. The project offers trainees the opportunity to gain relevant skills, including international experiences, the acquisition of intercultural competencies, the improvement of foreign language skills, the ability to carry themselves with confidence within the international market and the recognition of lifelong learning as a necessity for employment progression, in order to continually adapt to current developments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries profitting from the mobility project are trainees during their initial vocational training in the fields of early child education (kindergarten teachers), social work and business, as well as one accompanying person for each flow. Twice each year, in February and October, ten trainees, who, due to the great interest in the programme, have to undergo a selection process, take part in a work placement abroad lasting three weeks respectively. Each group is accompanied by a tutor from their home institution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the trainees, a member of our teaching staff will also benefit from the Erasmus+ mobility project. The staff member is going to be placed in an English college for Further Education for a period of four weeks. The placement will enable them to become acquainted with local conditions and workplace culture, to improve their skills and competencies and to apply them in teaching activities in Germany upon their return. Consequently, the temporary employment abroad does not only contribute to the staff member's personal development, but also serves as an opportunity for trainees in Germany to learn and benefit from their attained knowledge and insights and the internationalisation of the curriculum. This is also applicable for the abovementioned accompanying persons. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Placements UK is responsible for selecting and organising suitable work placements, determined with the help of an assessment of demand, for each of the beneficiaries. Trainees participating in such placements, thus, become acqainted with the English labour market and develop expert knowledge and key competencies relevant to their field of vocational training, such as intercultural understanding, language skills and the ability to observe closely and analyse situations, as well as an aptness for critical self-reflection, including related values and attitudes towards others. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe respective activities, rights and responsibilities of each partner, will be defined in a carefully drafted memorandum of understanding. Additionally, expected mobility goals are determined prior to the commencement of mobility in the form of a learning agreement. The evaluation of these objectives is carried out using the Europass Mobility tool. The aim is to utilise both the newly developed ECVET resources and documents as well as instruments for quality assurance generated through the innovation project \"Q-Mobil\", EQF and DQR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough participation in the mobility project and the, as a result, acquired competencies and specialist knowledge as well as the realisation of the importance of continuous learning and personal development, trainees in the dual system are being prepared to adjust to demands of professional skills and expertise in the service sector and to actively close any personal development gaps. This also means that they learn to consciously follow developments in their respective field of work and are capable of contributing to their work environment by proposing innovative and creative ideas and solutions. Thus, the benefits of the project are not limited to the individual participants alone. In fact, the particular institutions, organisations and businesses, tutors, future participants and so forth profit, in particular because reports put together by beneficiaries upon return are presented internally as well as externally at fairs and exhibitions, conferences, congresses and other similar events.

The organisation is involved with the realisation of language courses, with the placement in operations side companies, with organisational issues the participants might have during their stay in Brighton and the selection  of host families. \r\n\r\n- The need for the project is a result of different developments:\r\n\r\n1. The world of work is constantly changing, especially in the field of logistics, where processes, documents and organisational structures are subject to rapid change. Due to Europeanisation in logistics, those aspects are becoming more and more international and require a good command of the English language. \r\n\r\n2. In the curriculum of vocational schools, English is being scheduled for a single lesson per week, and thus does not take those developments into account. Hence it is essential for the students' future career prospects and their personal development to enhance their foreign language skills in combination with practical work experience. Furthermore a project like this may always develop the participants' personal competences und leads to a better understanding of joint European values.\r\n\r\n3. The apprenticing companies in the logistics sector in the Aschaffenburg region have expanded their branch network in the last years beyond the German boarder and are now increasingly working with partners and customers all over Europe. Apprentices with practical work experience made in the United Kingdom are therefore, in combination with good language skills, an important gain for every apprenticing company. That is why many apprenticing companies in the Aschaffenburg region have the burning desire for some time to have the possibility to integrate a part of their apprentices' training into a work placement in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n4. The participants have the opportunity, while doing a work placement, to gain a deep insight into the operational procedure of a British logistics company. They will reflect processes at their apprenticing companies and hence develop their practical skills. This project offers apprentices at the Staatliche Berufsschule II Aschaffenburg the possibility to qualify sustainably for the future challenges on the labour market\r\n\r\n5. The one-week language course that the students attend before their work placements includes contents that are part of the curriculum as well as general language skills and will prepare them for their work placements.\r\n\r\n- Sebastian Weyres, the project leader, is going to monitor  and evaluate the project in collaboration with the teaching staff of the \r\nworking team \"international relations\" at the Berufsschule II Aschaffenburg and the quality management team of the school.

For that purpose the students, who will be in their second year during the internship period, will work for 4 weeks in a foreign company in Britain (London, Bournemouth or Brighton) or in Dublin/Ireland after comprehensive preparation by the sending institution. The placements will be chosen according to the professional field of the training and the specific needs of the participants.\r\n\r\nWith regards to improving intercultural competences and the command of the English language, accommodating the students in host families is very beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe placements into the companies and the host families is done by our British and Irish co-operation partners LAF, English2000, Workplacements UK and Alaymont International. We have had reliable and effective partnerships with these institutions and with most of the placement companies for many years.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the internationalisation strategy of the sending institution, vocational education and training personnel is being included in the international mobilities.

Globalisation and internationally operating companies have a great demand for qualified students whose command of English is fluent enough to cope with international challenges. Naturally these young people and their teachers and trainers need to build on their basic language skills by getting the chance to use English in a practical context during the training process. It is here where our project can contribute most. Trainees who have not yet had the opportunity to participate in European exchange programmes in particular will benefit from our project.\r\n\r\nWhen in 2004/2005 English was introduced as a compulsory subject in vocational business schools for students in retail sales and office administration, this was the starting point for our school to tailor a special language learning programme for this target group alongside their normal English lessons. Initially an exchange programme was designed in the form of a three week college course to meet these students\u00b4 needs by focussing on practical English usage and intercultural competence at the same time. However, as our students strive for work experience it very soon became clear that workplacements abroad would be of even greater use to them. So the altered training programme that has been established since enables the participating students to do internships as well as college training. Our project \u201cWorkplacements in the UK\u201d offers a three week stay abroad to 20 students of our school who are currently in their vocational training. Students of all departments can apply, as long as they demonstrate a basic knowledge of English and show motivation. The same qualifications are required of members of staff who want to take part in the programme.\r\n\r\nDuring their three week stay in Brighton (UK) participants are expected to develop their communication and language skills both in general and in their special professional field. In a kick-off seminar in the first three days of their stay the participants receive individual training sessions purposefully designed to meet their individual needs. This will enable them to cope with their two weeks employment in the various English businesses, which will be organized for them well in advance. To add to their intercultural competence, students will be accommodated with English host families and thus will experience every day English life throughout their stay. On the last day of the programme there is an opportunity for reflection and evaluation. Along with the Europass, all participants will get a certificate of attendance from our organizing partner Workplacements UK, and a qualifying employer\u00b4s reference from their individual work places.\r\n\r\nTaking part in this project helps young people to develop their personality, to increase their self-confidence and to broaden their occupational horizons as the programme requires great flexibility and the readiness to handle an unfamiliar environment. Thus the ability to adapt to the constantly changing challenges of the working world is improved. Furthermore we hope the project will encourage students\u00b4 interest in further education and qualifications while still in training and in the long term to encourage them to seek employment abroad.\r\nEnabling our staff to participate in the project is a genuine part of our school\u00b4s continuing personnel development. In the course of our policy of developing an international focus this programme will eventually lead to an even wider opening of the \u201cBeruflichen Schulen Wittelsbacher Land\u201d to the outside \u201cworking\u201d world. Practical work experience abroad for our training personnel will help to implement the European focus in our lessons and to encourage this ethos in our students, who live in a Europe which is growing closer day by day. In this context the opportunities that are offered by the Workplacement-Project are ones that will enable our students and staff to meet the challenges of the 21st century.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002209_1"], ["7LR", "Workplacements in the UK - Working Abroad", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 22509.0, "From a historical point of view, the history of the European Union is a great story of an uncomparable success.

The organisation is involved with the realisation of language courses, with the placement in operations side companies, with organisational issues the participants might have during their stay in Brighton and the selection  of host families. - The need for the project is a result of different developments:1. The world of work is constantly changing, especially in the field of logistics, where processes, documents and organisational structures are subject to rapid change. Due to Europeanisation in logistics, those aspects are becoming more and more international and require a good command of the English language. 2. In the curriculum of vocational schools, English is being scheduled for a single lesson per week, and thus does not take those developments into account. Hence it is essential for the students' future career prospects and their personal development to enhance their foreign language skills in combination with practical work experience. Furthermore a project like this may always develop the participants' personal competences und leads to a better understanding of joint European values.3. The apprenticing companies in the logistics sector in the Aschaffenburg region have expanded their branch network in the last years beyond the German boarder and are now increasingly working with partners and customers all over Europe. Apprentices with practical work experience made in the United Kingdom are therefore, in combination with good language skills, an important gain for every apprenticing company. That is why many apprenticing companies in the Aschaffenburg region have the burning desire for some time to have the possibility to integrate a part of their apprentices' training into a work placement in the United Kingdom.4. The participants have the opportunity, while doing a work placement, to gain a deep insight into the operational procedure of a British logistics company. They will reflect processes at their apprenticing companies and hence develop their practical skills. This project offers apprentices at the Staatliche Berufsschule 2 Aschaffenburg the possibility to qualify sustainably for the future challenges on the labour market5.

The second and third week will be a work placement in a retail store or in a logistics company.The project will be taking place in Brighton, United Kingdom UK (first week) and in companies in and around the Brighton region (second and third week). Hence, the project is meant to largely improve the participants' professional competences as well as their language and social skills and, as a result, contribute to the improvement of quality of the vocational eduction in the Aschaffenburg region.  After having participated in the project, the participants will have significantly improved linguistic and professional skills.In addition, the participating students, as well as the participating teachers, will develop  an in-depth understanding of the country and people. Experiences that will in many ways result in interesting and motivating lessons. The Staatliche Berufsschule 2 also expects an improvement with regard to intercultural skills and methodological expertise.To summarise, the project is meant to lead to the better qualification of the students and participating teachers, while, at the same time, increasing the internationalization of the Staatliche Berufsschule 2 and the Aschaffenburg region all together.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002932_1"], ["7LR", "Enhancing professional skills within an international environment", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 54259.0, "\"Life is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page\" (St. Augustine)Our school's, the Freising Vocational College, key objective of our participation in the Erasmus+ programme is to enable our (still rather) young students as well as our teachers to improve and further develop their intercultural competencies, to increase their transnational mobility within Europe and to improve their professional language skills in Great Britain, thus gaining knowledge of the technical or specialised English required in their professional fields.

All the partners have been carefully selected and respond to the expertise presented by the consortium. The methodology of the project lays a great emphasis on learning-by-doing. One of the most crucial objectives of the project is to provide students with increased opportunities for mobility periods in other European countries, and this way to improve the level of key competences and skills the students acquire during their studies. The consortium will enhance the possibilities of the students and staff members to create contacts and enable them to network with experts in their field of study both on national and international levels. These objectives are reached by the vast and high quality cooperation between the national consortium and its European partners. ArtECult aims at improving the students\u2019 abilities to enter the labour market, and skills needed in every-day life. The international mobility periods enable the students to improve their language skills and their professional performance, to increase their self-esteem and self-empowerment, and to increase their sense of initiative and entrepreneurship.  Thus, the employability of the students will be enhanced and they will become active members of the society. ArtECult also promotes the internationalization taking place at the home institutions in many ways. All consortium members welcome and receive international students, arrange international events, and share experiences of the student and staff mobilities at several open platforms. In the Spring 2018 the consortium will organize a photography contest through social media.ArtECult aims at promoting equity and inclusion by facilitating the access to learners from remote areas, students with special needs or students that have obstacles that limit them from participating in international projects. These students will be given the opportunity to take part in the project by individually designed mobilities. Digital competences will be acquired and developed throughout the project. The mobility activities contain cultural and language training. The beneficiaries will produce different kinds of material through several media and open access will be provided for the public during the project. The students and staff will create blog-/vlog-posts, post photos both on the official ArtECult-blog and in social media. As a result of the staff mobilities, the teaching and professional skills of the staff will improve. The cooperation between partners will be improved and new contacts and partners will be found. The staff members\u2019 knowledge of their field and the working life will increase, and their motivation as to their work will improve.

Trainees who have not yet had the opportunity to participate in European exchange programmes in particular will benefit from our project.\r\n\r\nWhen in 2004/2005 English was introduced as a compulsory subject in vocational business schools for students in retail sales and office administration, this was the starting point for our school to tailor a special language learning programme at the ECBM in London for this target group alongside their normal English lessons. Initially an exchange programme was designed in the form of a three week college course to meet these students\u00b4 needs by focussing on practical English usage and intercultural competence at the same time. However, as our students strive for work experience it very soon became clear that workplacements abroad would be of even greater use to them. So the altered training programme that has been established since enables the participating students to do internships as well as college training. Our project \u201cWorkplacements in the UK\u201d offers a three week stay abroad to 20 students of our school who are currently in their vocational training. Students of all departments can apply, as long as they demonstrate a basic knowledge of English and show motivation. The same qualifications are required of members of staff who want to take part in the programme.\r\n\r\nDuring their three week stay in Brighton (UK) participants are expected to develop their communication and language skills both in general and in their special professional field. In a kick-off seminar in the first three days of their stay the participants receive individual training sessions purposefully designed to meet their individual needs. This will enable them to cope with their two weeks employment in the various English businesses, which will be organized for them well in advance. To add to their intercultural competence, students will be accommodated with English host families and thus will experience every day English life throughout their stay. On the last day of the programme there is an opportunity for reflection and evaluation. Along with the Europass, all participants will get a certificate of attendance from our organizing partner Workplacements UK, and a qualifying employer\u00b4s reference from their individual work places.\r\n\r\nTaking part in this project helps young people to develop their personality, to increase their self-confidence and to broaden their occupational horizons as the programme requires great flexibility and the readiness to handle an unfamiliar environment. Thus the ability to adapt to the constantly changing challenges of the working world is improved. Furthermore we hope the project will encourage students\u00b4 interest in further education and qualifications while still in training and in the long term to encourage them to seek employment abroad.\r\nEnabling our staff to participate in the project is a genuine part of our school\u00b4s continuing personnel development. In the course of our policy of developing an international focus this programme will eventually lead to an even wider opening of the \u201cBeruflichen Schulen Wittelsbacher Land\u201d to the outside \u201cworking\u201d world. Practical work experience abroad for our training personnel will help to implement the European focus in our lessons and to encourage this ethos in our students, who live in a Europe which is growing closer day by day. In this context the opportunities that are offered by the Workplacement-Project are ones that will enable our students and staff to meet the challenges of the 21st century.", "http://www.workplacementsuk.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003679_1"], ["7LR", "Flexibilisierung der Auszubildenden f\u00fcr den internationalen Arbeitsmarkt", "Work Placements UK Ltd", 55569.0, "Parties involved\r\nBerufliche Schulen Alt\u00f6tting is a vocational school providing initial training in Bavaria.

Despite the great achievements in the past, many young people and pupils have mixed feelings about pushing the integration in Europe to the next level. An essential reason for that sceptical attitude is that the pupils cannot collect any positive, individual experiences on private or on a professional level e.g. working or living abroad, because there is a lack of opportunities for them due to the high costs which come along with such a practical experience.  The only chance to support the idea of a merging Europe, continuing the integration process in the future, is to secure that the ideas of the European Union will be supported by a convinced major part of our young citizens. \r\n\r\nOur school is observing this nuisance for a while and we would like to do our part to change this, making Europe to a practical shared perception for our apprentices. Therefor, we officially apply to the Mobility Program of the European Union to give our trainees the chance to participate and experience the advantages and achievements in Europe on their own. The vocational \"School for Business and Information Technology\"  is a public institution from the city of W\u00fcrzburg. We have the plan to offer our pupils and teachers the opportunity to participate in a practical training as an optional module in their apprenticeship. We expect that the pupils will benefit from the participation in the Mobility Program in several areas, as an individual reaching a higher quality in their education and qualification and as an apprentice on a private level (self development). These are the main points (for potential participants) to apply as a school to the funding program in 2017. However, we are doing this application for the first time, and we will apply in this round 30 eligible internships which will take place in a work experience in London for 3 weeks. Our apprentices have a very diversified level of education, (from Certificate of Secondary Education to  General Qualification for University Entrance). They are learning their jobs in a full time school in the following professions:\r\n\r\n- IT management assistant\r\n- qualified IT specialist\r\n- businessman for office management\r\n- certified businessman assistant\r\n\r\nParticipating in the Erasmus+ program shall influence sustainable our apprentices, showing several positive effects. Due to the shortage of space, these points are given in headwords. \r\n\r\n- stimulate the curiosity for foreign cultures and civilizations\r\n- expand language abilities, fluently and spoken to a higher skill level\r\n- receiving the Europass certificate (\"mobility pass\" and \"language pass\") as a participant\r\n- boosting self independence of the participants in private while adopting to an unknown workplace and living in a host family for 3 weeks\r\n- increasing the willingness to show a higher labour mobility in the future\r\n- supporting the personal acquisition of knowledge about new or unfamiliar business processes on a long term basis \r\n- bringing new ideas from their internship abroad into their domestic apprenticeship during the 3rd year of their training, realising a transfer of their knowledge\r\n- inspire our pupils to create a positive attitude to the idea of a continuing integration in Europe\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also hope for positive long term effects for our teachers.
