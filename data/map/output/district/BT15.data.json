The exchanging of values and cultures will help to address myths and prejudices that others may have gained through social media or other outlets.\r\n\r\nThe counties involved in this at some stage in their history have been involved directly or non directly in political or areas of social conflict. This International Peace camp is specific to those countries with the aim that this can be used as an educational experience and act as a tool for sharing and discussing cultural and personal similarities and differences. \r\n\r\nThe project will draw on their life experiences engaging them in conversations about their identity, cultural expression, life experiences and future motivations. \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants; \r\nThe young people involved will range in age from 14-17 years and will be both male and female.  \r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project; \r\n\r\nA short description of the results and impact envisaged and finally the potential longer term benefits.\r\nYoung people involved in the programme will benefit from an increased levels of self confidence, new knowledge of different of culture traditions, sharing of good practice between organizations, rest-bite for young people who come from violent and conflicting counties \r\n\r\nThe project fosters young people's sense of global Citizenship in particular.  The project encourages learning on a global dimension through learning about each other's history and culture and that of their countries of origin.  The project will enable young people to explore and contrast the different approaches to cultural identity within partner countries.  The project will hopefully help challenge young people's perspectives of other cultures and therefore begin to see the impact of racism and xenophobia.  The project will enable the young people to see common concerns they have coming from each of their backgrounds and experiences as young people.  The project will instill in the young people the needs of other small ethnic communities who are alienated within their countries and the EU and how learning about each other and building friendships can address this.\r\n \r\nThe young people throughout the camp will be challenged both mentally and physically through activities and workshops that have been designed to be fun but thought provoking.

However, social media is a double-edged sword and our young people are increasingly exposed to online behaviours that erode their confidence, interpersonal relations: online peer pressure and abuse, the search for aesthetic perfection, the over-sharing of personal information, the \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect and risks of radicalization all pose serious risks to the development of positive, confident, active young citizens.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, research shows that the complex social situations presented by social media require young people to have not only basic technical competences but also more highly developed critical thinking skills, as found in a media literacy approach.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the aim of the Healthy Social Media project is clear: improve the ability of young people to critically assess and engage with digital and social media they are consuming and creating to become responsible, confident, digital citizens. \r\nIn order to achieve this, we believe that suppliers of nonformal education to the youth sector have a key role to play.  However, today\u2019s adult youth leaders and trainers are at a disadvantage having grown up in a pre-digital world.  Hence, our project methodology also works to provide them with knowledge, skills and tools to effectively teach social media literacy to the young people they serve. \r\nSpecifically we will: \r\n\u2022 Undertake a thorough Needs Analysis Study to develop an accurate picture of the diverse digital lives of young people, including their motivations, behaviours and understandings. \r\n\u2022 Create a Toolkit of strategies and Open Educational Resources to teach digital citizenship in order to help young people critically assess and understand the implications of the digital footprint they are creating including modules on:  \r\no Defining Digital Citizenship \r\no Privacy & security & safety \r\no Propaganda & radicalization\r\no Self image & identity & social relationships \r\no Digital footprint and reputation \r\no Digital drama/ conflict resolution \r\no Information Literacy and critical thinking\r\n\u2022 Develop a Media Literacy App to provide an accessible and appropriate way for young people to learn or revisit information regarding different themes of the open educational resources. \r\n\r\nHOME will be delivered by six cross sectoral organizations from the community, youth, VET, private and non-profit sector each with a strong track record in youth work, social inclusion and citizenship, and education.

However, despite this legislation being in place for over 65 years, numerous examples of discrimination remain evident in the everyday life of millions of European citizens. Therefore we saw a need of continue working on the theme of inclusion and we developed the project \"Bridging Diversity, Growing Together\". In this project we will concentrate especially on inclusion regarding ethnicity, religion, disabilities/special abilities, sexual orientation and gender.The aim of \"Bridging Diversity, Growing Together\" is that European rural youth become more aware of diversity among citizens and develop competences to act inclusively.The objectives of the projects are that rural youth:- share realities about their home communities around Europe, their structure, common employment fields, culture, language and living environment,- get aware about diverse ethnic and religious groups, gender and sexual orientation minorities and individuals with disabilities,- learn about these groups\u00b4 special needs and legislative framework throughout Europe,- share best practise in relation to social inclusion and equity within their own organisations and communities, and- increase capacity of their own organisation to offer inclusive activities.Within the project there are two activities planned. These are the advanced planning visit for the youth exchange (A1) and the actual youth exchange (A2). Both activities will be held at Greenmount Agricultural College in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The partner organisations involved are from rural areas in the following countries: Northern Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Slovenia, Austria, Latvia, Poland, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Hungary and Greece. To A1 each partner organisation will send one person and to A2 four participants and one group leader to the youth exchange. As such, the proposed project will involve 70 Erasmus+ supported participants. We will invite also Swiss participants and they will apply for funding nationally. Our target group is rural youth in age 18-25, and we welcome participants regardless ethnical and religious background, sexual orientation or special needs. Therefore we expect to have 5 accompanying persons for participants with special needs.Throughout the youth exchange, participants will work in pairs or differently sized, internationally mixed groups. The methods used within the delivery of the session will be interactive and based on non-formal education, for example:- Dynamic ice-breakers, team-building and energisers to break down individual personal barriers- Short theoretical input from local experts- Group research, discussion and debates- Role play and simulations- Study visits to local companies based on the study theme- Meeting local people, entrepreneurs and politicians- Living a day and night with a local host family to explore local culture and work life- Personal and group evaluation- Space for the participants to introduce programme that they facilitate themselves- Multicultural evening programmeThe impact on the participants is expected to be the following:- improved understanding and awareness of discrimination and what it causes throughout Europe,- wider intercultural awareness,- improved understanding of an common European community,- extended network of rural youth from many European countries,-higher motivation to become more active citizens within their own local community,- improved self awareness and self esteem since the project will challenge youth to overcome personal barriers,- improved understanding of the importance of self reflection and evaluation, and- improved teamwork, leadership, communication and linguistic skills.The impact on the participating organisations are expected to be the following:- Five of their members will develop an enhanced range of skills and teaching techniques that they can utilise within their own organisation- Participants will be able to bring the knowledge that they have gained within this project back to their own organisation to ensure that they are being as inclusive as possible within their local community- Group leaders will gain experience in project management and facilitation which can be utilised for future events within their own organisations- The partner organisations are expected to forge stronger working relationships enabling them to develop further educational projects at a European level- Improved communication between the partner organisations is expected to promote a greater awareness of the issues facing young people throughout Europe and projects that are being undertaken to address them", "http://www.yfcu.org", "Young Farmers' Clubs of Ulster", "erasmus_2015-3-UK01-KA105-022838_coordinator"], [2017, "Compass Towards Peaceful Rural Societies", "Young Farmers' Clubs of Ulster", 12400.0, 11, 11, "Background\r\nThe initiative to \"Compass towards peaceful rural societies\" (Compass) comes from that rural NGOs want to promote an inclusive and peaceful society in times of many challenges in Europe, such as: \r\n- conflicts in and near Europe\r\n- large amounts of refugees in Europe\r\n- tension in political climate and weakness in cooperation between European countries\r\n- Brexit vote and other countries that have been or are at risk of leaving the EU \r\n- increased amount of terror attacks\r\n- coup attempt in Turkey \r\nThe current situation in Europe has increased violations of human rights and raised hate speech and hostile attitudes, which is putting peace at risk. We are aware of that he situation is difficult and there is no single solution, but many small NGO actions together could do some impact for the better. Our organisations reach together almost half a million rural youth, so it is our responsibility to act in the best way we can in this situation. In the framework of this project, our rural NGOs cooperate on European level to act for peaceful rural societies.\r\n\r\nTheme\r\nEuropean rural youth NGO cooperation for peaceful societies\r\n\r\nAim\r\nThe aim of Compass is to set direction for rural youth NGOs to promote peaceful rural societies through meeting young peoples' needs in a changing Europe.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe objectives are that the participants, which are top leaders and staff of rural youth organisations:\r\na) get increased understanding of how rural young people experience the recent changes in Europe and how they choose to act on them to defend human rights and promote peace,\r\nb) share best NGO practices about their work on intercultural dialogue, reducing prejudices, preventing hate speech, including refugees, protecting human rights and strengthening the sense of European belonging,\r\nc) develop skills of brave and effective NGO leadership to meet new needs and challenges, and\r\nd) agree on a common direction for rural NGOs, based on young people\u00b4s initiatives, to contribute towards peaceful rural societies by policy making, campaign development and educational activities.\r\n\r\nFormat\r\nThe activity itself is short, three days, but the preparation process and dissemination add the impact of the project.\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nThe interesting approach of the Compass project is that we have turned the power pyramids upside down, compared to how the organisations normally works.  The main activity, A2, is strongly youth led by the organisations\u00b4 regular youth members or medium level young leaders.\r\n\r\nActivity\r\nThe project consists of the seminar A1, and its preparation and reporting/ dissemination/ follow-up. A1 will be held in J\u00e4neda, Estonia 7-9 September 2017 (+ travel days) and all the 11 partner organisations in this application are involved. They are from: Estonia, United Kingdom, Sweden, Slovenia, Austria, Latvia, Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, and Norway. There will be two participants from each country plus six team members, so 28 persons in total. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThe methods planned are:\r\n- Speed dating to get to know each other\r\n- Hopes, fears and contribution \r\n- Sharing of youth interviews and discussion\r\n- Theoretical input\r\n- Discussion in pair and groups of various sizes\r\n- Open space for sharing of praxis\r\n- Formulation of common policies\r\n- Reflection, feedback and evaluation in writing and as group discussion\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n- The impact on the participants is that they gain skills of brave leadership, policy making and knowledge about European institutions and programmes, as well as get increased awareness of the current European changes and their impact on rural societies and rural youth.\r\n- The main impact on the partner organisations is strengthened cooperation on the rural youth field, spreading of good praxis and common policies for peaceful rural societies.\r\n- The impact on communities on local, national and European level is promotion for peaceful societies as a result of participants\u00b4 attitude change and common policies.\r\n \r\nDissemination\r\nThe dissemination of Compass is actually larger than the seminar, but the seminar is needed to get the dissemination activities started. The dissemination activities are:\r\nA) A campaign for human rights and peace building, including a week 27/11 - 03/12 2017 when campaign actions will be done in rural areas at the project partners all over Europe\r\nB) Policy making for human rights and peace building\r\nC) Follow-up activities in form of seminars, trainings and youth exchanges\r\nD) An online platform with material gathered from the seminar, which can be used for educational purposes at the partner organisations, their communities and on European level.", "http://www.yfcu.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EE01-KA105-034758_6"]]}}, "3BJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Roaming", "Depaul Northern Ireland", 99299.0, 6, 36, "The project\u2019s aim is to improve personal, civic, cultural and professional growth of the students, through a training path abroad.

The group objective of \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d consists of a total of 25 young between 18 and 35 years old, in possession of a VET certificate, obtained in any of the institutions that make up the Consortium.The professional areas which the project addresses are:- Physical and sports activities- Agrarian - Administration and management - Graphic arts- Trade and marketing - Electricity and electronics - Hospitality and tourism- Information technology and communications - Installation and maintenance - Personal image - Sound and vision - Wood, furniture and cork - Health- Sociocultural and community services - Transport and vehicle maintenanceNeeds and problems of young students and/or graduates from Cuenca in these sectors are broadly:- A high rate of youth unemployment. - Little or no work experience. - Limited knowledge and use of a second language. - Low level of self-employment in the province of Cuenca. - A high concentration of the population in rural areas. - Very limited labour supply in the province due to lack of a solid business network. - Academic offer very limited. - Loss of human capital for young graduates who have to emigrate to work in jobs related to their training. - Lack of knowledge and use of ICT.- Little awareness of European citizenship and the workforce to compete in a global market.Based on the socio-economic context, the identified needs, the professional sectors and the overall project objective, we have established the following specific objectives:- Improve the employability of participants through quality labor practices in companies abroad.- Provide the tools to adapt to a new work environment in a different culture and learn other methods of work in a foreign company.- Develop skills in a second language.- Acquire job skills learning to create supportive alliances in a very different socio-cultural framework, working with people from other cultures.- Promote equal opportunities for young people in rural and urban areas, and between men and women.- Acquire social skills and develop personal skills by learning to organize and structure work routines.- Provide career guidance to participants.The relevance of the project is enhanced by the fact that it operates on a rural, depressed territory with scarce resources, providing greater opportunities for participants to complete their qualifications and find employment.\u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d provides 25 selected participants, according to a public and transparent procedure, the organization of stays for completing professional training in European companies for 3 months in Padova (Italy), Lisbon (Portugal), Belfast (Northern Ireland) and Prague (Czech Republic). In each of these cities, the Consortium has the support of a set of intermediaries and host companies that consolidate the quality of the project partners, with which they are collaborating for years.At a cultural and social level, apprenticeships offer young people of Cuenca the opportunity to live an enriching experience that will take place in a cultural context characterized by diversity, with new forms of work and resolving conflicts, which contribute to having a broader vision and social skills increasingly valued by companies.In short, \u201cFRAY LUIS DE LE\u00d3N III\u201d is the result of the commitment of the Consortium and its partners in continuing the promotion of training and employment for local young people.

Understanding and cooperation is needed much more then ever before. When affairs between countries decline the relationships between people from different countries should get much more intensive as they can play a very important role. International education could help to build these strong relationships. \r\n\r\nThe exchange of experiences and opinions in sustainable educational work will support an international and intercultural understanding for a civic and democratic society.  With this Project we  want to offer  space for persons who are youth workers, for to start a debate about the social conditions in Europe, which represents a frame for our work as trainers, teachers, youth workers and learn what influences us and also our target groups.\r\n\r\nFor our organizations it\u2019s necessary to recognize or to understand what can bring people in Europe together and what supports separation.

First we should recognize, that our own languages are different, but influenced by other cultures for centuries. So in all languages we can find words which are in origin from another country in Europe or even another continent. For example, in German language we can discover the origin of words from Arabian countries, from France, Italy, Malaysia, Greece etc. But most people don\u2019t recognize how multicultural languages actually are. Interesting will be to \u201csee\u201d the European history behind the words or languages and also to discover common European traditions, heritage and the reciprocally influence from European countries and to recognize that we are much more united, much more that we are aware. Prosperous trade, for example around the Baltic Sea (with the Hanse) or along the \u201cSilk road\u201d brought exotic goods to Europe. But this brought not only Merchants but also Scholars and with them ideas, religion and Cultures from the East to the West and the other way around, producing an exchange of experiences and knowledge. Migration of people, for example that of Germanic and Slavic people into Europe from the 2nd to the 11th centuries, the Crusades in the middle Ages or military conflicts in Europe or other regions in the world clearly left its mark. During this process which never ends, all languages where influenced and this means new words were created or words from other countries started being used in everyday life. Of course big influence of Greece was felt in all our cultures and languages so we decided to meet in Thessaloniki. \r\n  \r\nSecondly we will see and discuss, that language also show the values and thinking pattern of people and societies. We can recognize that language shows how we see the world and also that the same word could have different meanings from different point of views. How we use our language, which words we use for example to describe situations and show our values which are characterized personal, cultural and social. Our language is a part of our Identity and gives us a sense of belonging to a group of persons, nationality or culture. \r\nThis seminar will tackle issues such as: solidarity, intercultural dialogue, languages and barriers, history, anti-discrimination, conflict management, European citizenship, peace and conflict and Non-formal Education. Additionally, we will discuss our experiences with hate speech and what this means for us and our work with young people.

Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.nihf.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_31"], [2015, "Adristorical Lands: promoting mobility for achieving excellence in Tourism and Culture", "Northern Ireland Hotels Federation", 341111.0, 6, 35, "One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes.
