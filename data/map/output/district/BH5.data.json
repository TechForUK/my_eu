Its title: \"Learning \u2013 Healthcare \u2013 Upbringing: the European Experiences as a Source of Our Inspirations\u201d strictly covers the areas it aims. The cooperation between the three partners and the course organiser will provide 12 teachers presenting different levels of experience and job seniority with Erasmus Plus Training Program benefits. Their active participation in staff mobility will help our school gain an European like status of modern cooperative school with highly skilled teachers ready to fulfill contemporary educational, pedagogical and cultural needs. We will incorporate the European values using modern technological tools (e-learning), praising a healthy life style and qualities like tolerance, ethics, good manners, thus proudly educating European citizens. Our school will be familiar with differences present among other European educational systems, taking advantages of various solutions to school problems thanks to sharing and exchanging ideas. \r\n\r\nWe strive for taking the most of planned actions as their specific character meets our school needs and expectations. The methodology course as well as job shadowing at our partners\u2019 will certainly contribute to reaching our objectives.\r\n\r\nA lot of steps have already been taken in order to accomplish this project. The main actions include defining our aims, a considered selection of partners, electing a coordinator and teachers and making all preliminary arrangements. The coordinator and elected staff are to supervise all the preparation issues, maintain contact with partners, provide a purely linguistic, cultural and e-learning pre-course training, monitor action in progress as well as further evaluation and effects implementation. \r\n\r\nOur school considers the effects prominent to its activity. Using modern up-to-date teaching methods and techniques finds its place among other ones like applying e-learning platform, modifying school documents and creating the school\u2019s profile at e-Twinning platform as well as starting a new project within KA2 \u2013 Cooperation and Innovation for Good Practices. As for the issue of dissemination, every aspect of experience and knowledge gained is to be shared via different channels including our website, library and teaching staff meetings with other teachers, parents and especially with the probationers aiming for job experience in our school within another European project called Lider.\r\n\r\nThe trained teaching staff, modern European school, educated students and satisfied parents all give the opportunity to reach long term goals. Maintaning international contacts, constant corresponding with teachers and students of other European countries, sharing good practice, organising youth exchanges, participating in different projects all this enable us raising the level of Europeanism throughout the following decades.", "http://www.pokesdown.bournemouth.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA101-000770_3"], ["2AS", "Europa: Fuente de inspiraci\u00f3n y mejora", "Pokesdown Community Primary School", 3673.0, "Our school is situated  in a city called Vigo, it\u00b4s in the northwest of Spain. Our school has kindergarden, Primary, Secondary and high school. In Primary we have 400 students. It\u00b4s a multilingual school because we teach  non-linguistic subjects in English in different levels of Primary (till 4th course) and in  four courses of Secondary. We have an important  career path  participating  in European Projects. \r\n\r\nIn the current project  our school decides to send a teacher for two weeks to two foreign schools. These two foreign centres  are very strong in some areas we have detected  that we would like to improve in our school.The first job shadowing experience will be in the school year 2014/15 and th other one in 2015/2016. The observer teacher will belong to the department of foreign languages and  he will be experienced  in European projects.\r\n\r\nOur centre is immersed in a process of prioritization of the foreign languages teaching as well as in continuous study of how to help the pupils with learning disabilities to pass the subjects. \r\n\r\nDetected needs are: \r\n\r\nA - Linguistic competence of the faculty. Teachers need continuous improvement and continuous education.\r\n\r\nB - Methodologies in English teaching and CLIL  areas.\r\n\r\nC - Processes of helping  pupils with educational difficulties. \r\n\r\nD \u2013 How to group pupils and   cooperative learning. \r\n\r\nE- New possibilities of   the communication technologies.\r\n\r\nThe schools we want to visit and observe are:\r\n\r\n1-Pokesdown Community Primary School: It\u2019s in the  south of England   it has renowned prestige  in the education to pupils with learning disabilities. Logically it is an  English speaking country and  with a global approach of the areas.\r\n\r\n2-Tampereen kaupunki Tammelan koulu: Finnish school situated in Tampere city. They teach some subjects in English and some in  Finnish from 1st level of Primary.. They add other languages through Primary and also  have CLIL subjects and  a constant use of TICs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities will be principally an observation (job shadowing) of the classes focused on the aspects that we want to improve in our school, meetings with the teachers, participation in the classes to know the reality from inside and write of a report. We also will have meetings with our school teachers in order to decide the methodological changes we will carry out  based on the good practices observed in both foreign schools.\r\n\r\nWe hope  this observation and work with the foreign schools give us  the following results:\r\n\r\n- Short-term:  to improve linguistics skills and in a medium/long term we expect to renovate our methodology and get a pro-European vision of the education. In the other teachers, not observers, we also expect a methodological improvement. The organizational model will change too.\r\n\r\n- It will have an impact on the students and teachers.\r\n\r\nWe mainly try to improve the communication skills of our students and minimise the academic problems with our students.\r\n\r\nOur centre is immersed in a constant opening to new methodologies in all the areas and mainly in the foreign language teaching.  Nowadays our school is a multilingual school because we teach non linguistic subjects in English. We do it in Primary and also  in Secondary . That\u2019s the reason this is another experience in our constant practice of pedagogic renovation trying to support our typical character but always learning from the schools which are at the head of Europe.\r\n\r\n - There\u2019s also the possibility of  future collaborations with both schools.", "http://www.pokesdown.bournemouth.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-002035_2"], ["2AS", "The Importance of Teaching Languages through CLIL in Primary Education", "Pokesdown Community Primary School", 20443.0, "Pokesdown Community Primary School is a 2 form entry school in Bournemouth with 450 pupils on roll.  In 2013, the school was inspected by OFSTED and was judged to be Outstanding in all areas.  The has a higher than average number of pupils who are eligible for free school meals. \r\n\r\n The school has excellent capacity for innovation and improvement and in particular excels in its use of ICT and media and the Arts.  The school's curriculum is a creative and innovative Integrated Curriculum.  All subjects are taught through integrated projects which begin with an engaging 'hook' and culminate in an outcome which is shared with all or part of the wider school community.\r\n\r\nAs a school, we are already committed to working with international partners and to developing the quality of our curriculum, including European Languages.  In order to achieve our aims, we need to develop staff competence in both their own language skills and in teaching languages - particularly using the CLIL approach.  The acting headteacher and the head of MFL at the school are key staff in implementing new language teaching approaches and other teaching staff will be able to disseminate their learning and skills to the rest of the staff an beyond  \r\n \r\nWe identified 5 staff profiles:\r\n3 Class teachers, 1 Middle Manager (responsibility for MFL) 1 Senior Leader - responsible for curriculum development and staff continuous professional development\r\n\r\nThe Project is for  Staff training offered by course providers in France and Spain ( Tours Langues and Malaca Instituto).\r\n\r\nTraining/Activities varied according to the Development Plan and the participants' training needs,  but came from: Intensive Language Learning, Methodology of Teaching French or Spanish as a Foreign Language, Language & Methodology, Language and Culture, Bi-Component Courses including school attachment, \r\nThree-Day Study Visit ( Comparative Educational Systems, School Visit, Cultural activities for senior school leaders, subject specialists,  European Programme Coordinators and  staff involved in Erasmus+ activities) \r\n\r\nThe project will allow us to further the aims and objectives of our school Development Plan which has a focus on language learning.\r\nWe aim to make all staff across the school more sensitive to the importance of language learning and cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nThe competences acquired by participating staff will enable them to be more sensitive to learning problems of migrant (EAL )students  and, indeed, to native speaker students from the our catchment area which has a poor socio-economic background with consequent limited linguistic facility. We wish to develop CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) in mainstream Modern Foreign Language  teaching to native and non-native English speakers\r\n\r\nThis project will increase not only teaching staff personal competences, skills and sensitivities, but given the acquired  skills in teaching material development and lesson planning, will  impact on our student s' foreign and native linguistic competences and on cultural sensitivity to diversity. This  also generates a greater need to ensure that teachers share best practice and expertise. \r\n\r\nGoing forward, there will be a greater enthusiasm for  second language learning and for cultural exchange visits. Staff will be asked to build a range of language skills so that impact on research projects is enhanced through staff ability to disseminate results internationally and pupil transition to  secondary partners developing language learning  will be more efficient..  There will be an adoption of a CLIL based  approach  for the growing migrant community.", "http://www.pokesdown.bournemouth.sch.uk", "Pokesdown Community Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013321_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BH5"}
