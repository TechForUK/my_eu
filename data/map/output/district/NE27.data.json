To this end, INVITE applies a multi-stakeholder approach to co-design, pilot and demonstrate in diverse real-life settings demand-driven mechanisms, skill-sets and measures in order to facilitate OI. An innovation voucher scheme will stimulate interactions between the demand and the supply of knowledge via an unconventional yet highly flexible way, namely virtual human capital mobility. At the same time, a highly interactive and flexible e-learning intervention will empower EU businesses with the skill-sets to tap into EU\u2019s knowledge-base and turn it into value, while a public-private co-investment scheme will leverage small amounts of public funds to increase participation of private investors in open and collaborative models of innovation.  All pilots will integrate OI support services that will appropriately scale to the needs and capabilities of each case and will be facilitated through open ICT tools. Along the process a participatory co-evaluation framework will keep track of the pilots\u2019 performance and fuel iterative, user-driven refinements to generate results ready for scale up and replication. Dedicated business planning exercises in line with a tailored IPR strategy will pave the way for the launch of a pan-European service platform we dub as Open Innovation Lab, to the market, synergising with existing OI platforms and service offers to co-create value for the European OI ecosystem. To this end, INVITE brings together a complementary and multi-disciplinary consortium, comprised of key players within the OI market including leading platform and service providers, international and regional support networks, ICT solution providers as well as private investor networks and pioneering in OI regional development agencies.", 237222.0, 2565704.0, "INVITE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211098_915518302"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0QJ", "International Facettes", "KoCoS Messtechnik UK Ltd", 33375.0, "Project background\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSending organization is the Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Marburg, which offers several educational programs in the vocational fields of business/administration and health.\r\n\r\nThe Kaufm\u00e4nnische Schulen Marburg have many years of experience in international mobility: Since 1996 internships within the Leonardo da Vinci Mobility Project have been supported on a yearly basis to countries like France (e.g. Poitiers), England, Scotland, Spain, Malta, Italy, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine. Furthermore students have participated in internships in Argentina, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, the USA and Canada without EU funding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apprenticeship aims at students performing secretarial tasks in the service and trade sector and in manufacturing industries. They should acquire the competencies which are necessary in the field of business and be reliant in the use of the English language, orally and in writing. Intercultural competencies are necessary to adequately deal with business partners from other cultural backgrounds on a sustainable basis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe companies are very much in favour of the foreign internships and sometimes even add a participation in such an event to their work contracts with the students. Specific contents of the foreign internships are laid out in the training regulations and the framework curriculum. The educational regulations of the two year full time courses mandates an internship as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third group of participants consists of teachers of the KSM. At least two teachers are supposed to travel to one of the partner countries on a yearly basis, to improve their language skills, gather intercultural knowledge and cooperate with the local partner companies to evaluate and advance the projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe KSM has added the internationalization of teacher training to their school programme, to prepare apprentices and students for taking over responsibility in global contexts and in an increasingly multicultural society.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProfile of participants\r\n\r\nThe participants of the project are apprentices doing a three-year dual apprenticeship according to BBiG: management assistants in foreign trade, management assistants in freight forwarding and logistics, administrative assistants in public service and students taking part in a two-year full-time vocational course: foreign language secretaries and office assistants. Participants are usually 17 to 23 years old. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nActivities and objectives of the work placements\r\n\r\nThe interns should \r\n\r\n-develop competencies on the job (dual apprenticeship)\r\n\r\n-get practical experience on the job (full time courses)\r\n\r\n-achieve the learning goals set by their training regulations\r\n\r\n-improve language skills \r\n\r\n-increase intercultural competencies\r\n\r\n-improve knowledge of, and interest in other EU countries\r\n\r\n-learn how to communicate and do business effectively in other countries  \r\n\r\n-deal with commercial correspondence and documents in another language\r\n\r\n-get in contact with foreign business partners  \r\n\r\n-take a major step towards becoming a mature individual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected long term benefit\r\n\r\nStudents with a foreign background have the chance to use their language skills and improve their chances on the domestic job market.
