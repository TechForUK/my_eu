The job was funded for one year (1/11/10 - 1/11/11) by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome of the International Coordinator's role was to submit a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011 on behalf of the FE sector in Wales.  This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the second year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility under Erasmus+.  A successful application for funding was made in 2014 that will enable 18 Teaching & Learning Managers to undertake staff training in Finland in May 2015.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.   This is CollegesWales' second application for staff mobility funding and CollegesWales is the applicant organisation with 8 FE colleges in Wales as consortium members.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to:\r\n- ensure CollegesWales' commitment to the sustainability of the Rainova project\r\n- to further develop the FE sector in Wales' knowledge and engagement with innovation \r\n- to improve the FE sector in Wales' interaction with SMEs in relation to innovation\r\n- to provide a platform for the FE sector in Wales to become  part of a wider European network of actors involved in innovation and knowledge transfer.\r\n \r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere are 15 participants involved in this staff mobility project:- 14 of the participants are from eight Further Education colleges and one participant is from CollegesWales. The participants are all senior members of staff within their organisation and would be capable of affecting change in practices within their own colleges based on the good practice that will be seen during the visit.  The European partner is Tknika, a centre for innovation in the Basque Country, that has provided CollegesWales with a letter of agreement commiting itself to organising an appropriate training programme for the participants in the Basque Country.   Tknika has worked for over four years with CollegesWales on learner and staff mobility projects as well as on the Rainova project.

The Consortium is coordinated by the Department for Education in the Balearic Islands, being the following its main responsibilities: \r\n-Financial, administrative and contract management\r\n-Create contacts\r\n-Assessment, results analysis, widespread dissemination\r\n\r\n28 out of the 63 formal vocational training institutions and the two art schools which offer intermediate level courses (CFGM) as part of their offering are an integral part of this Consortium. It is made up of 20 courses belonging to 13 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their CFGM; \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s  global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of CFGM graduates and increase the number of students going on to study higher level courses (CFGS).\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n\r\n- Mobility of 62 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. \r\n- Mobility of 34 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany and the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 12 VT institutions acting as members, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VT institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the language platform and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education. All participants sign learning agreements/work programs before the mobility takes place. \r\n\r\nThe sending institutions in close cooperation with the host partners organize travel arrangement, lodging and boarding, insurance, and offer the necessary advice to obtain the necessary documentation.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of skills and its communication to members is done using Europass and national instruments (credits for teacher training, recognition of on-the-job training hours, certificate of participation).\r\n\r\nThe assessment plan includes the proposal, methodology, learning results, impact, objectives, dissemination and statistics. It includes questionnaires and/or statistics analysis from the Department of Education and it caters for contingencies or poor quality of activities. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes are: \r\n-Increased interest by teachers on European projects \r\n-Growing number of institutions offering the dual learning apprenticeship model; \r\n-Improvement in management of transnational mobility\r\n-Better academic outcomes \r\n-Network creation; \r\n-Decrease in early school leaving rates\r\n-Changes in the Administration to facilitate these projects and their participation in KA2 and KA3;\r\n-Awareness of institutions and regional companies. \r\n\r\nThe impact is measured with numerical indicators calculated from statistical data and questionnaires.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan  and achieved results disseminates on traditional, social media and on the Web: the assignment and results of the project, the experiences of participants (reports on the website, dual FP educational sessions); sessions about organization of mobility in Erasmus + FP projects; debriefings to potential participants; hosting of  foreign participants, video report of mobilities by Audiovisual students; electronic posting at the end of the project with the results and experiences of participants.

Initially, the job was funded for one year by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome was the submission of a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011.  This funding enabled apprentices to undertake two/three week work placements in Europe.  Subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 were also successful and have attracted funding of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants to undertake short term work placements in European countries.  There was a successful consortium application for Erasmus+ funding in 2015 for 92 learners and two successful applications for staff mobility funding in 2014 and 2015.  The International Coordinator's role is now funded by the membership fees of the colleges and consortium applications for staff and learners will continue to be submitted under Erasmus+.  In 2016, CollegesWales is the applicant organisation  submitting a consortium bid on behalf of 9 FE colleges in Wales, 1 private training provider (ISA Training) and 1 large employer (TATA Steel). The objectives of the project are to enable participants to:-explore and deepen their knowledge of their vocational subject within a European context and within, at times, a totally different working environment  -consider future employment opportunities in Europe within their chosen field -enhance their professional profile and employability by providing evidence of having acquired additional professional skills during their work placements overseas as well as enhancing their personal communication and team-working skills through working with their European counterparts- to support the European tools for transparency and portability of qualificationsFor the sending and receiving organisations, the project will enable them to develop and strengthen partnerships across a range of curriculum areas and to contribute to the European Commission's objective to improve and modernise VET education across Europe. The project will also support the EU transparency tools for qualifications and enable vocational learners to become more work mobile across Europe. Number and profile of participantsThere are 215 participants in this project - 197 are full time VET learners from FE colleges across Wales who are studying national vocational qualifications at either Level 1, 2 or 3 and who are defined as those whose studies typically include work-based learning.  18 of the participants are apprentices from TATA Steel, ISA Training and Coleg y Cymoedd.  The participants will be selected from the following curriculum areas:- Childcare, Travel & Tourism,  Hair & Beauty, Catering, Sport, Outdoor Education, Aerospace, Business Administration, Engineering, Health & Care, Leadership & Management, Creative Arts & Sport Therapy.   The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and some (those working with partners for the second time or more) have drafted sample training plans with the receiving organisations.  Activities The participants will undertake two or three week training periods in VET schools and/or companies/businesses in 8 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced by the sending and the receiving organisations.  They take into account the qualifications that the target group of participants are working towards in Wales and have identified learning outcomes that can be achieved during the training period that will contribute to the achievement of that qualification.  Europass Mobility will also be obtained by the participants to provide evidence of the learning achieved.Impact and longer term benefitsThe impact of these opportunities on individual participants is significant and will lead to some participants having the confidence to consider working in a different country in the near future or later in life.  Returning participants who share their positive experiences with their peers, staff in their sending organisations and possibly with their employers will generate an enthusiasm for this type of activity and provoke others to consider participating in a similar project in the future thereby increasing the numbers of participants from Wales.  There is no doubt that for some of the participating organisations, taking part in this type of activity has had a positive impact on student intake into specific curriculum areas within that organisation.

It shares its boundaries with the province of Madrid. Due to its geographical closeness to Madrid (roughly 35 kilometres away), it has grown a lot in the last years as a consequence of the housing boom whch took place in Spain some years ago. Lots of families arrived in the area looking for cheaper houses to live in than on the outskirts of Madrid. El Casar is a \u2018bedroom city\u2019 of Madrid where plenty of families commute to work in Madrid every day. The public means of transportation are limited, especially between the town and the capital city of Guadalajara. There is a high school-abandonment rate in the area. The educational and cultural offers are very limited and overtly insufficient. The extremely high unemployment rate has considerably increased in the last years and it has left plenty of families in economic dire straits. The school has got 594 students who study ESO (Compulsoty Secondary Education Stage), Bachillerato (School-Leaving Post-Compulsory Education), Basic Vocational Training, Middle Grade Vocational Training and Superior Grade Vocational Training. The whole vocational training stage is part of the profesional family of Administration and Management Some of the  students come from the very town El Casar but mostly do from neighbouring towns and residential areas, very badly connected with one another with public transportation and with inexistent cultural possibilities.Our school has offered the multilingual programme offered by the Regional Government of Castilla La Mancha since 2008. This linguistic programme has also been in existence for Vocational Training since 2011.Our school has recently started an internationalization process. The school received the ECHE letter for the mobility of students in 2013 and it is currently taking part in three mobility projects  (KA 101, KA102 and KA103). It has carried out 10 mobilities since 2014. All of them have been for FCT abroad and Dual Vocational Training abroad. Our school has got hosting partners in Italy, Wales, Croatia and Malta. Financing for the key action KA 101 was received in 2015. It comprises six mobility actions for the formation of teachers  including both courses for English teachers and for Teaching Methodology. Our school is involved in five eTwinning projects at the moment. We have been hosting partners of the LP Montgolfier Vocational Training Secondary School located in Annonay (France) since the 2015-2016 school year.b) Aims of the Project:The aims of the Project can be analyzed from a  threefold perspective: students, teaching staff and non-teaching staff.1. As for students this Project will inmensely help them in the following respects:-It will increase their learning opportunities abroad.-It will provide them with the necessary skills for the transition from the learning and academic world to that of learning in real-life labour market.-It will enable them to improve their learning of foreign languages, especially English.-It will promote their knowledge of other cultures within other European Union member states (remarkably the United Kingdom).2. As for teaching staff this Project will enable them to improve in many areas and respects, namely:-It will favor the Exchange of teaching experiences and the methodological innovation in the  vocational training educational stage.-It will Foster international cooperation among educational institutions in terms of the mobility of speacializaed Vocational Training teachers.-It will improve their learning of foreign languages, with special incidence on English.3. As for non-teaching staff this Project will also be of invaluable help since it will favour their improvement with respect to the following:-Their cooperation  in the internationalization of their educational and academic institutions in therms of a better knowledge of the management of similar mobility projects.- Their promotion of their knowledge of other cultures of other European Union member states, with special relevance of the United Kingdom\u2019s culture.c) Number and profile of the participants:-Eight Students either currently studying or who have recently finished their Middle Grade of Administration and Management Vocational Training studies.-Teaching Staff: One Vocational Training teacher.-Non-Teaching Staff: One office worker.d) Description of the activities. They can be carried out in any of the following institutions:-Practical learning for both students currently studying or who have recently finished their Vocational Training studies . This learning can be done either at the hosting partner\u2019s offices, at Vocational Training Secondary Schools within the network of the project\u2019s members led by our hosting partner or at a Vocational training school with the whole network of our project\u2019s partners.-Observation period for the teaching staff at a Vocational Training course with the p", "http://www.collegeswales.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA102-024697_1"], ["7AB", "European Initial Vocational Placements 2016", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 362949.0, "Context:The Departament d'Ensenyament (Ministry of Education of Catalonia), considering (1) the experience gained in 16 years in VET mobility projects, (2) the launch of the Erasmus+ program and (3) aware of the remaining barriers to the promotion of mobility, launched during the last academic year 2014-2015 the \u201cProgram for training mobility and international cooperation in VET institutions\u201d to give a new impetus to mobility strategies not only within the Departament d'Ensenyament but also at VET schools.In this sense, this Erasmus+ (VET) project \u201cEuropean Initial Vocational Placements 2016\u201d (EUROINVOC 2016) is part of this wider joint strategy, which also includes another consortium project in the Erasmus+ higher education area.Objectives:As a result, the Directorate General for IVET and Specialised Studies of the Departament d\u2019Ensenyament aims to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Erasmus+ KA1 action:1.

The participation of senior staff from FE colleges across Wales, representatives from their key employers, the CEO and Director of Policy & Development at CollegesWales as well as CollegesWales' scope to invite at least one Welsh Government official to take part, gives the FE sector the opportunity to thoroughly explore how it will support the Welsh Government in achieving its objective of having a more highly skilled workforce with Level 3 - 5 skills being delivered within a vocational context.", "http://www.collegeswales.ac.uk", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036294_coordinator"], ["7AB", "Pan Wales Vocational Learner Mobility 2017", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 910986.0, "Context/background of the project\r\nCollegesWales is the national organisation that represents the 14 Further Education institutions in Wales.  CollegesWales has employed a full time International Coordinator since November 2010 to engage the FE institutions in European funded projects such as Erasmus+.   One of the main reasons for carrying out this project is to raise the aspirations of young people currently undertaking vocational education and training in Wales by empowering them to participate actively in society, not just in Wales but further afield in Europe.  This experience will build their confidence, enhance their technical & soft skills and improve their employability.  This opportunity will encourage them to develop friendships & networks beyond their current comfort zone giving them opportunities to learn a new language & enjoy different cultural experiences.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to enable participants to:\r\n-explore and deepen their knowledge of their vocational subject within a European context and within, at times, a totally different working environment  \r\n-consider future employment opportunities in Europe within their chosen field \r\n-enhance their professional profile and employability by providing evidence of having acquired additional professional skills during their work placements overseas as well as enhancing their personal communication and team-working skills through working with their European counterparts\r\n- to support the European tools for transparency and portability of qualifications\r\n\r\nFor the consortium members and the receiving organisations, the project will enable them to develop and strengthen partnerships across a range of curriculum areas and to contribute to the European Commission's objective to improve and modernise VET education across Europe. The project will also support the EU transparency tools for qualifications and enable vocational learners and apprentices to become more work mobile across Europe.\r\n \r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere are 480 participants in this project - 423 are full time VET learners from FE colleges across Wales who are studying national vocational qualifications (NVQs or BTECs) at either Level 1, 2 or 3 and who are defined as those whose studies typically include work-based learning. There are 57 apprentices in the project from Coleg y Cymoedd, Gower College Swansea and CELSA Manufacturing UK Ltd.  Across the whole project, there will be 18 curriculum areas with participants undertaking work placements in 9 European countries: Childcare, Travel & Tourism,  Hair & Beauty, Spa Therapy, Catering, Sport, Outdoor Education, Animal Care, Business Administration, Mechanical Engineering,  Agriculture, Construction, Motor Vehicle Engineering, Equine Management, Electrical Engineering, IT, Interactive Media & Graphics and Creative Media. The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and there are some draft training plans already in place for some organisations.  \r\n\r\nActivities \r\nThe participants will undertake two week training periods in companies/businesses/primary schools in 9 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced jointly by the sending and the receiving organisations.  They take into account the qualifications that the target group of participants are working towards in Wales and have identified learning outcomes that can be achieved during the training period that will contribute to the achievement of that qualification.  Europass Mobility will also be obtained by the participants to provide evidence of the learning achieved.\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\nThe impact of these opportunities on individual participants is significant and will lead to some participants having the confidence to consider working in a different country in the near future or later in life.  Returning participants who share their positive experiences with their peers, staff in their sending organisations and possibly with their employers will generate an enthusiasm for this type of activity and provoke others to consider participating in a similar project in the future thereby increasing the numbers of participants from Wales.  There is no doubt that for some of the participating organisations, taking part in this type of activity has had a positive impact on student intake into specific curriculum areas within that organisation.

In order to guide this increase in the right direction, it is important to offer good support in the form of information and organizing activities. \r\n\r\nWith this support, various activities have been set up so that departments engaged in contact with various schools in Europe over the past year. \r\n\r\n\u2022 That resulted in an idea from the hairdressing department to organize job shadowing at Coleg Cambria with several teachers and to exchange traineeships between each other. \r\n\r\n\u2022 With CEF Mallorca we agreed to set up a study program to exchange students and teachers. \r\n\r\n\u2022 School workers who are deployed at Arcus have applied for the Emotional Intelligence training that is given in Barcelona. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Several schools from Spain have asked us to help find suitable internships in the region and offer support in exchange programs, they are also committed that they will offer the same service for our students and teachers. \r\n\r\nThe result we strive for with this project is that after completing an international internship, a student will become wiser, more responsible and more independent and thus more likely to enter the labour market. This international experience should also ensure that a student becomes more understanding with other cultures. For teachers we strive that they share their gained experiences with colleagues and use them during lessons. \r\n\r\n The impact which we want to achieve is that teachers and students take on an ambassador role when they return and motivate others to think and act without borders and broaden their horizon with a European mindset. \r\n\r\nOur long term aim is to: \r\n\r\n- build strategic partnerships. \r\n\r\n- Bring students and teachers within the European Union closer together. \r\n\r\n- Let the students experience that the European Union knows no borders \r\n\r\n- and that all the students with their international experience can be of added value for the companies in the region.  \r\n\r\nWe as Arcus College are convinced that with our enthusiasm, motivation and passion we will ensure that this project will be valuable, sustainable and the necessary impact for all parties for the European Union.", "http://www.collegeswales.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038808_20"], ["7AB", "Danish Trainees to Wales 2018", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 43464.0, "This partnership is made of two parties, one partner is the Dansih employment authority, the municipality of Aarhus, Center for \u00d8konomi og Personale.\r\nThe partnership foreign contigents are the intern hosts Coleg y Cymoedd and Gower College Swansea.\r\nThe Central Denmark Region and the municipality of Odense have been invited to join the project; however primarily in a role as collaborators.\r\nThe project participants consist of students who are in the final part of their education in public administration within the Danish municiplaties and regions.\r\n\r\nThe partnership goal is to continously develop and share the experiences gained through these foreign internship in order to strengthen the student exchange process as it should be seen as an integral part the vocational education, as well as improve the student exchange between governmental institutions in Denmark and Wales, which undoubtedly will improve the quality and the international intention in the vocational education.\r\n\r\nOn a collaborator level the goal is to strengthen personal development and intercultural understanding by completing a part of their education as an internship in the vocational education.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it is essential that future employees within public administration are able to operate within a multicultural society in which language as well as cultural skills are becoming an integral part in solving everyday tasks.

CollegesWales has employed a full time International Coordinator since November 2010 to engage the FE institutions in European funded projects such as Erasmus+.   One of the main reasons for carrying out this project is to raise the aspirations of young people currently undertaking vocational education and training in Wales by empowering them to participate actively in society, not just in Wales but further afield in Europe.  This experience will build their confidence, enhance their technical & soft skills and improve their employability.  This opportunity will encourage them to develop friendships & networks beyond their current comfort zone giving them opportunities to learn a new language & enjoy different cultural experiences.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to enable participants to:\r\n-explore and deepen their knowledge of their vocational subject within a European context and within, at times, a totally different working environment  \r\n-consider future employment opportunities in Europe within their chosen field \r\n-enhance their professional profile and employability by providing evidence of having acquired additional professional skills during their work placements overseas as well as enhancing their personal communication and team-working skills through working with their European counterparts\r\n- to support the European tools for transparency and portability of qualifications.\r\n\r\nFor the consortium members and the receiving organisations, the project will enable them to develop and strengthen partnerships across a range of curriculum areas and to contribute to the European Commission's objective to improve and modernise VET education across Europe. The project will also support the EU transparency tools for qualifications and enable vocational learners and apprentices to become more work mobile across Europe.\r\n \r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThere are 536 participants in this project - 520 are full time VET learners from FE colleges across Wales who are studying national vocational qualifications (NVQs or BTECs) at either Level 1, 2 or 3 and who are defined as those whose studies typically include work-based learning. There are 32 apprentices in the project from Coleg y Cymoedd, Tata Steel and CELSA Manufacturing UK Ltd.  Across the whole project, there will be 19 curriculum areas with participants undertaking work placements in 12 European countries: Health & Social Care, Childcare, Travel & Tourism, Hair & Beauty, Catering, Sport, Outdoor Education, Business, Engineering, Agriculture, Equine, Agriculture, ICT, Interactive Media, Furniture Making, Plumbing, Construction, Public Services and Performing Arts.  The participants haven't yet been selected even though all curriculum areas have identified target groups of learners and there are some draft training plans already in place for some organisations.  \r\n\r\nActivities \r\nThe participants will undertake two week training periods in companies/businesses/primary schools in 12 European countries.  The sample training plans that have been developed for this application have been produced jointly by the sending and the receiving organisations.  They take into account the qualifications that the target group of participants are working towards in Wales and have identified learning outcomes that can be achieved during the training period that will contribute to the achievement of that qualification.  Europass Mobility will also be obtained by the participants to provide evidence of the learning achieved.\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\nThe impact of these opportunities on individual participants is significant and will lead to some participants having the confidence to consider working in a different country in the near future or later in life.  Returning participants who share their positive experiences with their peers, staff in their sending organisations and possibly with their employers will generate an enthusiasm for this type of activity and provoke others to consider participating in a similar project in the future thereby increasing the numbers of participants from Wales.  There is no doubt that for some of the participating organisations, taking part in this type of activity has had a positive impact on student intake into specific curriculum areas within that organisation.

We are in a position to claim that these kind of mobilities lead perfectly well those which are developed by intermediary companies or the ones with direct access through the companies themselves.    In february 2015 ,a group of teachers from CIPFP La Costera set out to develop a website based on the professional training aimed at fostering experiences of exchange with students from professional training.This ambitious proposal needs to be carried out through the international cooperation with other centres of Vocational Training and with other educative entities from the area.

The focus will be on working with groups of young people from ethnic minority and migrant populations.At an EU level the need to develop sport for social inclusion and migrant populations is seen as a priority.  The challenge facing young people from Ethnic Minority and migrant populations is that in addition to more general social barriers they can also face further barriers to participating in recreational sport. There have been numerous studies and projects at an EU level highlighting inequality issues in governance of sport and also high profile campaigns in football, in particular tackling racism. The issue of participation is sometime less obviously addressed but is clearly an emerging issue for these communities as highlighted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA).The objective of this Youth Sport Development Ambassadors (YSDA) project in relation to voluntary action is to identify they ability of young people to develop activity among disengaged social groups. The project will look at sustainable delivery models using young people as ambassadors in creating and delivering new activity for their peer groups. Young people from each of the participating countries will be recruited and trained as Youth Sport Development Ambassadors (YSDAs) who will create and deliver new physical activities for their peer groups in their own countries. The YSDAs will share best practice at an EU level for the first time in this field by observing and supporting each other in the planning and delivery of these activities in the other participating countries.  YSDA Mentors will also be recruited to support the development work of the YSDAs and to provide guidance and advice.The legacy of this project will be the development of a mobile application YSDA APP with supporting website.", "http://www.collegeswales.ac.uk", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", "erasmus_579718-EPP-1-2016-2-UK-SPO-SCP_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8ED", "SPENCER DAVID*WILLIAM DAVID JENKINS WARREN SPENCER CARR", 31372.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_61987", 2016], ["7AB", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 18743.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens' Dialogues and 'Partnership' actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2016_67509", 2016], ["8DR", "PAUL REGULATORY SERVICES LIMITED*", 272327.0, "Improving lifelong health and well-being (08.02.03.01)", "fts_2017_6197", 2017], ["7AB", "COLLEGES WALES - COLEGAU CYMRU LIMITED", 95991.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_48213", 2017], ["8DR", "PAUL REGULATORY SERVICES LIMITED*", 4612.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_49094", 2017], ["8ED", "SPENCER DAVID*WILLIAM DAVID JENKINS WARREN SPENCER CARR", 33704.0, "Communication of the Commission Representations, Citizens\u2019 Dialogues and \u2018Partnership\u2019 actions (16.03.01.04)", "fts_2017_61076", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CF15"}
