The project aims to increase both EVS participants\u2019 and young people\u2019s capacity to realise their potential through inter-cultural working. \r\nBy supporting vulnerable young people in the context of the advanced yet challenging UK social care system, participants will experience:\r\n\r\n- enhanced employability skills for the social care sector and beyond\r\n- increased clarity around long-term goals for further education and employment\r\n- improved social and communication skills, including language competencies \r\n- enhanced inter-cultural awareness and identification with European values\r\n- increased confidence in their own abilities and propensity to achieve\r\n\r\nThrough the opportunity to interact with ambitious, hard-working and EVS participants, young people \u2013 who often experience low self-esteem and have aspirations that are hampered by their disadvantageous circumstances \u2013  will experience:\r\n\r\n- enhanced inter-cultural awareness and broadened horizons\r\n- increased aspirations for the future\r\n- increased motivation to make positive change, including participation in education, employment and volunteering \r\n\r\nAs one of the key tasks for participants will be the arrangement and hosting of Depaul activities within the communities they work, young people will also become more engaged with their communities as a result of EVS participant's contribution.\r\n\r\nIn this project we are working with our partner organisations in Finland, Portugal,  German, Denmark and Italy and we will be welcoming 6 new participants.  1 EVS participants  will be at our North East projects and 3 at our  London projects and 2 at our North west projects.\r\n\r\nThe planned activities at each project include the following:\r\n\r\n- Assisting staff and volunteers with the Get up and Go Programme i.e. leading and planning workshops such as cooking, gardening, yoga and arts and crafts - they will lead groups of 3-5 people.\r\n- Promoting the Get Up & Go Programme to clients through a variety of ways.\r\n- Mentoring young people to reach their personal mobility goals as referenced throughout the application \r\n- Assisting staff with administrative duties to include updating client files , date input and risk assessments.\r\n- Shadowing support staff with client support sessions.\r\n- Developing and creating their own projects using the skills that they bring to Depaul. \r\n\r\nParticipants who take part in the activities gain the following skills and experience:\r\n- enhanced employability skills for the social care sector and beyond\r\n- increased clarity around long-term goals for further education and employment\r\n- improved social and communication skills, including language competencies \r\n- enhanced inter cultural awareness and identification with European values\r\n- increased confidence in their own abilities and propensity to achieve\r\n\r\nWe will monitor the impact throughout the programme before finally publishing and disseminating the results in collaboration with our partners.", "https://uk.depaulcharity.org/", "Depaul UK", "erasmus_2017-3-UK01-KA105-046387_11"]]}}, "6ET": {"cordis": {"data": [[1225497600000, 1320019200000, "Intuitive operation and pilot training when using marine azimuthing control devices", "South Tyneside College", "The aim is to improve by policy and design, the safety and security of ships by taking into account the man-machine interface and the training of maritime pilots; specifically when operating ships equipped with azimuthing control devices. From the thrusters on smaller, but numerous, harbour support vessels through to the pod-drives on cruise ships and ocean going liners, azimuthing control has rapidly established itself in the maritime industry. But while the industry has risen to meet the demand, this rapid evolution has not allowed sufficient time for the propagation of knowledge throughout the different disciplines. Though the various sectors of the industry each have their own expertise, a lack of communication is both restricting progress and compromising safety and security; in addition, much work is being repeated unnecessarily. To address this problem, the project will provide a forum for technical review and cross-disciplinary discussion between the key industry sectors; specifically: - The specialist in HYDRODYNAMIC MODELLING and testing, both theoretical and experimental, and expert in the understanding of azimuthing control and propulsion devices. - The designers and manufacturers of MARINE SIMULATION software, hardware and physical models that are used for the training of marine pilots.
