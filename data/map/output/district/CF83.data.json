The system is extremely versatile because it only requires one vessel to operate and that can be any vessel of opportunity at the time of an emergency spill.\nThe mops are made by novel fibres with controlled oleophylic and hydrophobic behaviour in order to absorb large quantities of oil and increase the recovery efficiency.  Once the mops are saturated they are recovered onboard of the vessel and squeezed through a roller system: the oil collected is then stored and the mops are deployed again for another cycle.  Traditional systems, in comparison, are characterised by lower performance in terms of oil recovery and cannot be used in harsh sea conditions, which are typically encountered in case of ship wreckage and often characterize the cold seas.\nProject objectives are related to the development of the oleophylic and hydrophobic fibre materials of the mop and the related treatments, the optimisation and production of the mops, and the development of the overall oil spill recovery system for field demonstration.\nFour SMEs constitute the core of the Project, representing the whole supply chain for the oil spill recovery end product. SMEs are supported by three RTDs providing the necessary experience in the field of technical textiles, engineering and oil spill responding services. SMEs will benefit 100% of project exploitable results, in a scheme that will provide full return of investment within 3 years by the end of the project.", 239206.0, 1173713.0, "Force7", "New oil slick technology cleans up", "The hunt for oil has lead to its exploitation in environments that experience low temperatures and harsh sea conditions typical of the polar and sub-polar regions. However, the technology for containing and recovering spilled oil has not changed significantly over the past 25 years.", "Oil spills can cause enormous damage to the marine environment by poisoning and smothering ocean life. Although a wide range of technologies currently exist for the removal of oil spilled into water, none are capable of successfully recovering spilled oil from cold, rough seas. \n\nThe in\u00a0situ burning of the spilled oil and the use of dispersants are of limited value and must be implemented within 72 hours of the incident. However, these methods do not remove all the oil, even under ideal conditions. Containment and collection of the oil is also a common solution, but requires calm seas for it to be effective. \n\nAn EU-funded consortium made up of small and medium-sized enterprises and research institutes solved this problem. They developed a highly effective oil recovery system capable of operating in challenging conditions. The http://www.force7.eu/ (FORCE7) project designed and tested an innovative system made up of interconnected mops that are deployed behind a tugboat and dragged through an oil slick. \n\nThe mops are made up of a novel combination of natural and man-made fibres that absorb large quantities of oil, but not water. Once they are saturated, the mops are brought onboard and squeezed by rollers to remove the oil, which is collected. They are then redeployed for another cleaning cycle. \n\nProject partners developed and tested fibres to determine their oil sorption capacity and their ability to repel water under different conditions. The information was used to select the most suitable grades of synthetic and natural yarns. Currently, polypropylene is the most commonly used absorbent material for clearing up oil spills. However, natural fibres such as cotton, wool or flax show superior behaviour and come from renewable resources.\n\nResearchers also investigated the best surface modification treatments in order to improve the fibres' properties by developing high-performance textile structures. The materials were then tested on a small scale under simulated working conditions to determine mop behaviour. \n\nDifferent configurations of the mops were modelled and studied using simulations of the marine environment in order to determine the key parameters. This data was then used to design and build an efficient oil recovery system suitable for use in cold, rough waters.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119135950.jpg", "fp7_106833_952521668"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4GY", "The 'Futuro Foundations' project", "Nant Y Parc Primary", 6971.0, "The 'Futuro Foundations' project has been created to help prepare learners for a diverse labour market, our aim is to arm pupils with key skills that echo the demands of modern European employers.

By observing storks we can connect our topics, our science zones. We can create a connection among all the fields of science we are interested in. In this way our students will have an in-depth knowledge about storks and different science fields that are in connection with our main topics. Experiencing these scientific areas in person our students will be able to see the coherence between zoology, astronomy, brain, archeology and renewable energy. The teachers involved in the project have observed that our students need to be supported due to their lack of opportunities for international interaction, they also need to learn how conduct experiments and carry out researches  in  the different fields of science.Through this project we will give pupils and students the opportunity to develop their awareness of the European dimension, by working collaboratively in science zones. We will put the  emphasis on learning and practicing the different aspects needed to reach objectives. The main goals are to communicate with kids from other countries, to work  and share contents of zoology, archeology, alternative sources of energy, astronomy and cerebration. The project will encourage staff and students to develop their own ICT skills, which will be necessary to share information with partner schools and it will support team building and cooperation skills of the involved people. Also there will be an improvement in the use of English language, the communication language of the project. The contents of the project develop transversal skills related to various areas of the curriculum and reinforce various key competences: communication in mother and foreign languages, science, digital, learning to learn, social and civic entrepreneurship and sense of initiative.We are going to work in different topics in the three years of the project duration but the link between us is our stork. We will be doing different  type of activities adapted to  our main topics. The methodology will be: find out what they know, explain them exercises  and share the research results with their project partners, implement positive measures to their topics. For sharing the appropriate datas, experiments and research results, each school will elaborate with the pupils creating the Erasmus+ corner. Pupils exchanges are very important in this project to put in practice inclusion aims, it is necessary living together  to realize and to know how to conduct in the different situations that happen. The results of the project will be: charts from the five schools for each aspect, evaluation documents: surveys, questionnaires, texts ; summary from each of the participants about their stork within their own topic, power-point presentations, texts\u2026 of the activities developed in the exchanges, summary of each group of students about their experiences in the interaction with the pupils involved in the project, evaluation by the students  and teachers about the project, permanent exhibition in each school of the materials.The impact on teachers and on schools will be: more skills of using clues to inclusive practices; competences of cooperation between different types of schools and strengthen European cooperation. On pupils: less discrimination of pupils with less knowledge in science, improvements of abilities of cooperative learning and increase their awareness of European citizenship. Forward this project the schools will go on cooperating by e-Twinning platform.All the materials will be for sharing at the school websites.It will have transcontinental dimention because beside the project partner schools we will also collaborate with schools from India and the USA, like we did in our previous project.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA219-024930_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AX", "Social Business Wales East Wales", "Wales Co operative Centre", "Providing specialist business advice and support to social enterprises with the potential for growth and job creation.", "ERDF", 1097715.0, 2206054.0, "erdf_wales_80857"], ["2AX", "Social Business Growth Fund EW", "Wales Council for Voluntary Action", "Providing social businesses in Wales with access to investment to grow and create jobs.", "ERDF", 500000.0, 1000000.0, "erdf_wales_80945"], ["2AX", "IB and 3-SET ERDF EW", "Wales Council for Voluntary Action", "Delivering a Pan Wales, specialist support service to the third sector.
