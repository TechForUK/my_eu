In this project for 2015-2017 we also work together about staff mobility (Annex 1).\r\n\r\nFirstly student and staff mobility is an important part of the colleges' initiatives to strengthen the international perspective in our educations and an important contribution to make our educations attractive to future students. Secondly student and staff mobility is vital in order to profile our colleges as competent partners concerning international projects both in Denmark and Europe. The main objectives of the project with regard to the students are to provide a basis for the students to obtain knowledge about international relations especially within the social and health care area and the child care area. Furthermore to strengthen the students' intercultural competences through practice placements abroad in order to strengthen their skills in foreign languages, personal and professional competences in order to improve their possibilities to become a part of the European labor market. With regard to the staff the main objectives are to strengthen the development of quality and innovation in both teaching and administration and to enhance internationalization at our colleges by sending out members of our staff for supplementary education abroad.\r\n\r\nThe project encompasses 102 social and health care students and child care students, 9 teachers and 1 administrative employee. The stays abroad will take place at relevant institutions. For the students the stays will last 1 month for members of staff the stays will last 1 week. The stays will be arranged in cooperation with our partners abroad, mostly vocational colleges that offer similar educations. These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Letter of Intent to fulfill the demands of the project.\r\n\r\nThe sending organization is responsible for preparing the participants pedagogicaly, linguistically and culturally, making sure that the insurances and health insurances comply with the demands of the Erasmus+ programme. Furthermore the sending institution is responsible for transferring the grant from the Erasmus+ programme to the participants' accounts. The receiving organization is responsible for finding suitable practice placements to the students, organizing a programme to the members of staff that will fulfill their objectives, finding suitable accommodation, making sure that there will be a mentor at the practice placement to guide the students, providing a tutor from college that will support the students in obtaining their objectives and be available if the students need help in unexpected situations. \r\n\r\nFor the individual student it is expected that the learning outcome for the practice placement will be achieved and that the student will graduate in due course. It is furthermore expected that the students will improve their skills in foreign languages, develop their personal, vocational and intercultural competences and as result improve their possibilities to become part of the European labor market. With regard to the members of staff it is expected that they fulfill the objectives for their educational course and develop their intercultural competences in order to ensure a continuous positive development of the international perspective at our colleges contributing to fulfill the international strategies at our colleges.  As a result it is expected that the obtained knowledge and experiences will be reflected in a development of the teaching methods and administrative practices at our colleges. The participants (students and members of staff) are expected to share their knowledge and experiences with their colleagues and fellow students in order to contribute to the development of the international perspective of our colleges. If the management of our colleges consider it to be of relevance it is expected that the participants in meetings with our local and regional employers inform about their experiences in order to enhance the understanding of internationalization at our colleges and for the educations as such.\r\n\r\nIn a broader perspective it is expected that our participation in activities within the Erasmus+ programme will improve the participating colleges development of the international dimension in our educations.

These partners many of which we have cooperated fruitfully with for several years have committed themselves by Memorandum of Understanding / Letter of Intent to fulfil the demands of the project. However 4 of the educational stays for teachers will take place at new partners. The traning center at SOSU-Fyn has established contact to M\u00f8llehagen skolecenter in Stavanger, Norway. In the autumn of 2015 a group of teachers from Stavanger visited SOSU-Fynto obtain knowledge about how we work with rehabilitation and nursing and how we create learning activities that resembles situations at work. During the visit it became clear that SOSU-Fyn also can learn a lot from M\u00f8llehagen Skolecenter with regard to the mentioned areas, so we plan to sent 3 teachers to Stavanger. The fourth member of staff plans to go to Accrington and Rossendale College, UK, a relatively new partner. In February - March SOSU-Fyn will receive12 students and 2 acompanying teachers for practice placements at kindergartens from this college. The pedagogical coordinator at SOSU-Fyn, who will tutor these students, wants from an organizational perspective to investigate  how the college works with students in danger of dropping out. Secondly the coordinator wants to investigate the possibility for creating a virtual communcation platform for PA-students at SOSU-Fyn and students at Accrington College. In the comments to the Charter for our Consortium it was stated that some important points are missing: 1) more definite plans for our activities in the international strategies of our colleges 2) the frame and intentions for our work with receiving students and teachers form abroad for practice placments and staff traning  3) considerations about future demands for adding new partneres to our project. With regard to item 1 it is a topic that we will address  on our next meeting in the consortium. Here we will discuss how we in cooperation with our managers and principals can develop our international strategies in line with the European and Danish political objectives  . With regard to item 2 we  typically receive students and staff from colleges that have proven their ability to organize stays  with a high degree of quality for our students and members of staff  and we want to repay this in the same way. Furthermore the intention also is to give our students and members of staff a possiblity to exchange experiences about relevant topics an hereby enhance  the interest for and understanding of international activities in VET. Concerning item 3 it is a topic that we currently discuss. At our last meeting we concluded that right now, apart from M\u00f8llehagen Skolecenter and if possible another partner in Norway, since students that have difficulties with foreign languages are interested in going to Norway due to the similarity between Danish and Norwegian, we will not need new partners. This is also our estimation fwhen looking at the near future.  We also want to adjust the requests  for stays with us for students and teachers from our foreign partners with our capacity to organize these stays and at the moment we experience a significant increase in requests for practice placements for students and educational stays for teachers from our present partners abroad.", "http://www.accross.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA116-022029_5"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["5JR", "Renewable Energy Technology Commercialisation and Deployment & Energy Efficiency and Renewables Promotion and Implementation", "East Lancashire Chamber of Commerce and Industry", "Working across the 2 investment priorities of 4B and 4F the project will \u20134B \u2013 work with the Lancashire SME community, to stimulate take up of energy efficiency measures, \u2022 auditing the participating SMEs \u2022 to identify and\u2022 to implement installation of energy efficiency and\u2022 renewable generation technologies, (leading where appropriate with Lancashire manufactured products) working to achieve the best economic benefit for the SMEs whilst helping them calculate the resulting greenhouse gas production decreases.4F \u2013 work with Lancashire SME technology developers who have low carbon technology products that are now \u201cclose to market\u201d and now need support to move their products into full commercialisation \u2013 we will work to \u2013 \u2022 identify potential manufacturers in the advanced manufacturing community of Lancashire who are keen to diversify into the low carbon market, \u2022 find development partners/early adopter customers \u2022 to enable demonstration of the products (including but not limited to, wave and wind energy, smart grids, distributed generation, solar and photovoltaics, heat networks, heat pumps) \u2022 supporting market exploration, \u2022 manufacturing commencement and \u2022 promotion into the SMEs across Lancashire\u2022 The full client journey is detailed in the attached narrative (2 page word document).The activities will be carried out by \u2013East Lancashire Chamber of Commerce and Industry, North and Western Lancashire Chamber of Commerce, Business Wise Solutions LtdNewground CICRegionally/NW based specialist consultants, to be procured in line with EU funding requirements.The activities will be delivered across Lancashire, with a central Low Carbon Technology Information Centre, both virtual and physical, within the lead applicant \u2013 East Lancashire Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Referrals will be stimulated and encouraged from all regional partners \u2013 especially BOOST, wider Growth Hub initiatives and Universities.
