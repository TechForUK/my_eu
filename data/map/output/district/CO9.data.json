Most augmented reality systems require the use of a Head Mount Display (HMD) to project a virtual image in the user's eyes. To date, no HMD featuring good field of view, good resolution and small dimensions has been developed. This has been one of the major bottlenecks to create an augmented reality market. Although, several interesting concepts emerged during the last years (Google Glass project is a recent example), all of those rely on a display decoupled from the optical system. This creates constrains on the mechanical configuration of the eyewear which increases volume and mass. Moreover, those systems have difficulties to cope with corrective vision requirements of a significant part of the users. The proposed project brings forth a completely disruptive solution using an innovative optical design where the display and the optical system are merged together in a single lens. This opens a new paradigm in the design of a HMD. First: it decreases the mass and the volume of the system. Second: it allows very large field of view. Third: it makes possible fashion and variable designs without any severe geometrical constrain. Fourth: it allows integrating correction optics inside the HMD lens. Fifth: it creates the possibility to use the traditional eyewear market to leverage the augmented reality market (similar design, similar distribution configuration, similar customization). The proposed design uses the most advanced technologies in optics, holography and OLED displays and integrates them in a single piece. This Lensplay (lens and display in one single physical element) will open up complete new ways for humans to interact with information computers. It will be a breakthrough that will ultimately change the world sees itself.", 135864.0, 1271723.0, "HIDO", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111165_950625900"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3ER", "The YES Alliance\r\n1\u00aa ALIANZA EUROPEA PARA EL EMPRENDIMIENTO SOCIAL JUVENIL\r\n1ERST EUROPEAN ALLIANCE FOR YOUNG SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS", "Year Here", 65000.0, "Form a Strategic Alliance to facilitate the exchange, transfer and the dissemination of innovative practices related to promote entrepreneurial education and improving the employability of young social entrepreneurs, which will be held three Market Place (one per country involved), who meet in a single space and place to all relevant stakeholders in each country, connecting them also with the ecosystems of other countries explicitly: initiatives related to youth social entrepreneurship will be presented (contests, awards, training, accelerators, etc.), articulated through different institutions (foundations, NGOs, funding entities, etc.), connecting them in turn with your target audience, youth and educational institutions, and making visible the work of young social entrepreneurs as referents.\r\n\r\nThis project responds to the need to unite and empower the work of organizations that work with youth Social Entrepreneurship to maximize their reach and pave the way to young people who want to undertake a project of social change.\r\nWe miss a space that brings together information and resources available on the ESJ ecosystem for easy access by users (young people and youth and educational institutions), which is in turn a space of encounter, interaction and exchange of knowledge between the actors themselves.
