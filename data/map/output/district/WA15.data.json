Such a shift would of course be highly detrimental to the achievement of the general objectives of a sustainable development of the European transport system. The project would also find the best balance between environmental and economical requirements, in order to avoid an always possible shift from rail transport to a less sustainable mode like road, even on electrified main routes would also encourage the engine industry to give rail applications serious consideration in their product development plans and provide the European Commission with proposals for a flexible move to the IIIB objective.\nThe four years project is therefore build on the basis of several application sub-projects, representative of the different engine applications (rail cars, Diesel Multiple Units, shunting locomotives, main line light and heavy-haul locomotives) that will enable the industry to evaluate the different solutions to be applied to rail systems in real operating conditions.\nThe optimum trade-off between the reduction of pollutant emissions by rail vehicles and the fuel energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as the overall impact of the applied technologies on the environment through a life cycle assessment approach, will be identified by this experimental part of the project.

Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B standards as far as railcars and locomotives are concerned represent a major step in terms of engine and after-treatment technology. However, specific issues regarding the emission reduction technologies such as additional weight and space, reliability and waste heat are posing major concerns.\n\nTackling the technical challenges that need to be solved to comply with this new regulation has been the objective of the EU-funded project 'Clean European rail - diesel' (http://www.cleaner-d.eu/ (CLEANER-D)). The project sought to achieve emission levels well below the Directive and be prepared for further upcoming regulations by evaluating the best possible innovative and hybrid solutions.\n\nCLEANER-D demonstrated the feasibility and reliability in service of railway rolling stock powered with diesel engines compliant with Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B. To achieve this, it equipped an existing railcar and a locomotive with low-emission diesel engines. Another task involved installing a new-generation Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B-compliant prototype engine in a newly designed locomotive.\n\nProject members also evaluated the potential for further emission reduction to help the EU decide on future stages beyond the Stage\u00a0III\u00a0B. State-of-the-art and innovative after-treatment technologies were examined, including selective catalytic reaction and exhaust gas recirculation, through developing a 560\u00a0kW engine model. Another activity was to investigate potential use of alternative fuels such as biodiesel for further reducing emissions.\n\nHybridisation of diesel vehicles, a medium- and long-term technology for reducing carbon dioxide and other pollutants was also included. CLEANER-D evaluated the potential for energy savings by implementing different energy storage technologies. Studies on the most promising hybridisation solutions led to the most appropriate propulsion system architecture with appropriate energy management.\n\nBy running trials under operational conditions, CLEANER-D demonstrated that the engine industry can deliver reliable and affordable diesel engines suitable for railway applications.

Pupils come to the school from a varied catchment area and the school has very good results at KS2 SATS.  The school was graded 'good' in 2013 by Ofsted and our school development plan reflects the shared aim of achieving an 'outstanding' grading by our next inspection.  Staff are constantly encouraged to develop their skills and teaching practice, including through transferring to teach in different year groups and key stages. \r\n\r\nFrench has been taught at Heyes Lane in KS2 for a number of years, using a programme of study designed exclusively for the school by the form MFL Coordinator.  Last year, French was introduced to KS1 children and this year extended to EYFS.  \r\n\r\nAs language teaching at primary school level will become compulsory from September 2014, the MFL Coordinators have recently conducted an audit of staff skills and confidence in French teaching.  It was apparent that confidence amongst many staff, both in their own French language skills needed to deliver the curriculum, and  was low and therefore not in line with our school aim of delivering 'outstanding' teaching and learning across all curriculum subjects.  A need of developing assessment procedures and monitoring progress in line with curriculum requirements was also identified. \r\n\r\nPreviously, Heyes Lane was linked successfully to a primary school in the French village of Gillette; however, due to staff issues in the French school, this link has not been maintained this year.  The MFL team have agreed with Senior Leadership the enormous benefits for children's learning, of building a meaningful link with a French partner school and this March, one member of staff is visiting a school near Toulouse with the aim of setting up a long-term link.  Such a link would provide a real context for children's language learning, as they communicate with French pupils their own age.  It would also increase intercultural understanding and open the children's eyes to future opportunities overseas.   \r\n\r\nFollowing discussion with Senior Leadership regarding the results of this audit, it was agreed that French CPD training would be beneficial.  The primary aims of the CPD would be to:\r\na) upskill staff in French language skills as required to teach by the National Curriculum\r\nb) increase staff's knowledge of language teaching methodologies\r\nIt was decided that immersion training in France would be the most beneficial for participants as this would maximise language learning opportunities as well as building on their intercultural understanding which could then be shared with pupils.  Staff attending training in term-time would also be able to visit the partner school to sustain and develop the link set up by our colleague. \r\n\r\nSix members of staff motivated to attend French CPD in France have been identified.    These staff all wish to improve/update their knowledge of language-specific teaching methodologies and their own French language skills.  The staff are of varied age and teaching experience.  All staff are motivated by the importance of providing context for learning by sustaining a useful partner school link. \r\n\r\nFollowing discussion with other schools in Trafford and our own research,  we have identified a number of course providers  that would meet our school's needs.  We would like to send participants on week long immersion courses offering tuition in the French language as well as language teaching methodology and curriculum policy.  Courses are available on a variety of dates, in holiday time as well as term-time, in order to minimise disruption to children's lessons from use of supply teachers during staff CPD. \r\n\r\nParticipants will attend these immersion courses over a two year period, beginning this August. On return to school, they will provide written reports of their learning and experiences to be made available to all staff.  They will present key learning points from their training in staff meetings and offer opportunities to other staff for team teaching of French, or observation by peers.

To achieve these goals the school wishes to send, over the course of 2 years, 3 teachers to take part in a French language and cultural immersion course in Carcassonne, France. The participants will be teachers at the school who have applied and successfully explained why they feel that the course will have a positive impact upon their teaching of French and the learning of the children in their class and the school overall.\r\n\r\nThe course has three main areas. Firstly, participants will be provided with high quality language lessons delivered by native speakers, who are experience in teaching French as a foreign language. Secondly, participants will be taught about new ways of teaching French to the children. These sessions will show how to cater for all learning styles to ensure age-appropriate, quality teaching of listening, speaking, reading and writing. They will also learn other skills such as how to incorporate language and cultural learning into other subjects. The final area is the cultural aspect.
