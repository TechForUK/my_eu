Global mobile data traffic grew 81 % in 2013 and reached 1.5 Exabyte\u2019s per month at the end of 2013, up from 820 petabytes per month at the end of 2012. Users now demand fast and affordable connectivity when and wherever they are. The growing use/ownership of laptops, tablet computers and larger smart phones has also led to an increasing demand for high quality content such as HD video on the move. \n\nCurrent satellite communications antennas cannot fully meet this large and growing need: Mechanically steerable antennas which are bulky, heavy, require maintenance and pose considerable vehicle integration challenges. Phased arrays based on military technology are too costly for commercial applications. Existing low cost antennas trade-off the cost of the antenna against the requirement for much more expensive satellite bandwidth per Mbps transmitted. Their performance is also too limited for use in certain geographical areas (particularly at large skew angles).  \n\nThe overall objective of this project therefore is to successfully refine and scale up for market readiness the world\u2019s first cost effective, electronically steerable, digital, low profile phased antenna to enable high speed satellite communications on the move. This will enable us to gain a substantial market share in the \u20ac 1.185bn Broadband Satellite Communications-on-the-Move (COTM) market and the associated antenna market which amounts to \u20ac0.39bn. Both of which are growing rapidly. We predict that we can achieve a 2.5% market share by 2020, generating total revenues of \u20ac134m and a cumulative EBITDA of \u20ac63m, creating 781 jobs.

We deliver a range of projects related to employment, training and the provision of work based learning opportunities. Our projects aim to address the emerging skills gaps across a variety of sectors by providing direct support to unemployed people, and facilitating work placement opportunities in Europe and the UK as well as wider strategic work to address emerging skills gaps within projected areas of economic growth. We actively pursue projects to support those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe E.M. project aims to address the labour market needs within the UK's Event Management sector.  The project will address the existing skills gaps and raise standards of training in order to meet projected levels of expansion and replacement demand within the sector. The project provides an experiential learning opportunity for participants and an international experience for young people who have not previously had the chance to travel, developing their professional and personal competences and better equipping them for entry into the labour market. \r\nREY Europe will be working with several UK based FE colleges to recruit young people who are working towards a Level 3 Event Management NVQ. These students will typically be between 17 - 19 years of age and it is very unlikely that they will have lived overseas or lived independently (away form their family home), prior to their involvement in the project. REY Europe has proven experience of working with this target group and providing a structured and supported Mobility experience. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to run for 24 months, from January 2015 to December 2016, with 10 planned flows of participants. Each flow will recruit a cohort of 10 learners who will spend 6 weeks in their overseas placements. \r\nThe Mobility will take place in Tenerife, and learners will be hosted in the area of Arona. The learners will be placed in small groups in work placements within Tenerife. The placements are all local tourist focussed organisations whose daily activities involve arranging and delivering a variety of small to medium sized events, predominantly targeting holidaymakers and corporate events, but also includes some that are focussed towards the local community.\r\nThe work placements will provide the learners with first hand  experience of the process of organising events within a company. The events are varied and as well as understanding operational planning, event set up/breakdown, health & safety requirements etc. the learners will also gain customer service experience and develop their confidence working in a cross cultural environment. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive 2 days of face to face training in the UK prior to their departure; once abroad the learners will receive an in-country orientation by a REY Europe representative who will be based in Tenerife throughout the Mobility to ensure that there is full pastoral support available to help with any learner needs. An Accompanying Person form the partner VET colleges will also stay with the group for the first 5 days of the Mobility. \r\nPrior to the Mobility, learners will be supported to develop an individual Learning Agreement and a set of Learning Outcomes, which will be shaped by the job description that they have been given by their placement host. These will be defined within the context of the ECVET framework.  The learners will be supported in-country by a line manager within the placement, who will conduct regular review meetings with the learners to chart their progress; the line manager will verify the achievement of Learning Outcomes that have been achieved during the Mobility and will demonstrate these within a Europass Mobility certificate. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that students will gain first hand work experience, intercultural experience and personal\r\ndevelopment that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.  It is hoped that the students will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the European labour market and a set of transferable skills that will better prepare them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment and an international outlook. \r\nIn the short term, this will be evident through the successful completion of Learning Outcomes. We also plan to monitor and evaluate the impact of the mobility of the longer term by looking at participants future career pathways and how the mobility has supported their progression to employment. \r\nThe anticipated impact for participating organisations is that their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so that they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.ucb.ac.uk", "REY Europe Limited", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012225_2"], ["1JB", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE BIRMINGHAM", 28692.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.ucb.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE BIRMINGHAM", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000196_coordinator"], ["1JB", "Eco Management Solutions Tenerife", "UNIVERSITY COLLEGE BIRMINGHAM", 185424.0, "This project will send 120 young people studying qualifications in either a BTEC Level 3 in Animal Management and Behaviour or BTEC Level 3 in Travel and Tourism out to Tenerife to complete a 2 week work placement. The young people will typically be aged between 18 - 19 years old and are keen to pursue a career in animal management or the tourism sector. The students critically need experience to deepen their academic learning. They need this for several reasons: to give value and meaning to their academic work; to strengthen their CVs; to improve their employability skills, to help them network with potential employers; to help them decide on optimal career paths for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe work placements will provide these students with practical experience and increased work-based skills and knowledge that are fundamental to their programmes of study. The work placements will also provide opportunities for complementary sector-specific training that is unavailable to students in the UK but readily accessible in Tenerife. The work placement roles include working as research guides on whale watching boats, giving guide talks to tourists, working at the visitor centre in Puerto, working with the animal rescue centres and shelters, liaising with tour operators and hotel groups.\r\n\r\nThe timing of each cohort's mobilisation will be agreed by the AWF, the UK partner colleges, Kingston Maurwood, University College Birmingham, Gloucestershire College and City and Islington College and the host partner organisations, taking account of the availability of students due to exams and UK holidays, the needs of partner organisations, their capacity to host and other issues that may affect the preferred timing. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive comprehensive pre-departure training in the UK and in-country orientation on arrival in Tenerife and will receive pastoral support throughout the mobility to ensure success.\r\n  \r\nSignificantly, the students will gain relevant subject-specific knowledge and practical experience that is directly relevant to their formal programmes of study and have exposure to alternative work environments and processes that would be unavailable to them in the UK. Many of the students come from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and, generally, opportunities for them to gain work experience that provides a broader perspective of the wider world and employment possibilities beyond their immediate region are limited. The project will add value to their college programmes and aims to support students to broaden their horizons: personally and professionally.\r\n\r\nThe longer-term benefits of participating in this mobility are that, in addition to obtaining work-based skills and knowledge, the students will also benefit from an intercultural experience and personal development that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.

It should be unerlined that, in 2015-2016, the Institute has consolidated, in the preparatory phase of the actual proposal, relationships with training centres and international companies, already mentioned in its internationalization plan (e.g. Vuste Envis, Cap Ulysse), and created new contacts with companies able to identify and implement quality training in accordance with the participants\u2019 profile.In addition to the international mobility project, The Institute - in 2015 - has consolidated the relationship with local companies that declared their availability to participate in the selection process of candidates and to the final evaluation of the project and its impact. They have also identified apprentiship paths at local level to increase students occupability and training courses about tutoring an counseling for teachers to complement mobility experieneces in 2016-2017.Operational actions specifically for project management of the actual proposal are; -signing MOU for single professional profile;-Information and selection of candidates and staff through the procedures included in the Vet card request.

The opportunity will also assist with building on other skills such as confidence and communication as well as living independently. \r\n\r\nThe plan is to send 80 students on a 3 week work placement in  Portugal, Malta, Cyprus, Denmark and France. Students are aged upwards from17 yrs old  and are from a range of backgrounds with the majority being female.  Quite a high percentage of students are from underprivileged backgrounds and this is the perfect platform for them to develop and experience an opportunity that may not be available to them through other avenues.\r\n\r\nThe placement opportunity is open to all Further Education students who are invited to apply in the form of a CV and accompanying letter. Students will go through the interview process and if successful will be offered a place on the project. Students will then attend weekly sessions with destination mentors in order to build a rapport with peers and accompanying mentors. Weekly sessions will involve team building activities, fact finding, social events and many other topics. Students will also have to attend weekly language lessons which will consider the vocational settings that the students will be working. Students will be provided with information through this preparation period about the placement and what is expected etc.\r\n\r\nStudents will be accompanied by an experienced mentor who where possible will have knowledge of the vocational area that the student will be placed.  Mentors will assess and monitor student progress whilst visiting students on placement and will offer full support and guidance. A full itinerary will be planned in advance so that students have a detailed daily account of activities. Students will work 5 days out of 7 and will attend cultural visits on other days. Students will also meet with mentors at the end of each day to evaluate events. Students will  also be required to attend a one to one tutorial  with the accompanying mentors where targets will be checked and set. \r\n\r\nStudents will be placed in a range of different settings to include travel &tourism students working as holiday reps, kiddies reps, entertainers or hotel reception.

Hair students will work in hair salons, hotels or college commercial salons working with their own columns. Beauty students will work in Hair & Beauty salons or 4* Spa hotels performing treatments on clients or product training in some of the Spa's. Chefs will work in large hotel kitchens or small family run restaurants of which some are Michelin star. They will work on all areas of the kitchen including prep, cooking and the passe. Baker students will work in small bakeries and patisseries making specialist breads and chocolates. Hospitaility will work in large hotels mainly front of house in busy tourist resorts. Health & social care students will work in schools, nurseries and creches working with babies and children upto the age of 6yrs.\r\n\r\nStudents will have to attend an evaluation session and meet with the project team in order to evaluate all aspects of the project.

Realtime online seminars are called also webinars. Although the webinars could be used in all education sectors for seminars, lectures, communication of groups, they are still not very common in Europe. There is a lack of online-trainers, who are able to conduct webinars and there are no guidelines for the pedagogy of webinars, increasing the attractiveness and efficiency of such learning activities. Additionally many learners, including disadvantaged persons,  cannot estimate how useful and efficient webinars are and how easy it is to participate without the need of  high digital skills. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWebinars are per se cross sectoral. The  seven project partners  from Bulgaria (New Bulgarian University, Sofia), Germany (VINC Learning UG, Rastatt), Greece (Hellenic Regional Development Centre, Patreos), Hungary (Pannon University, Vezprem),  Italy (Associazione Acquamarina) and Portugal (Technical School of Image and Communication) are  active in high education, further education and adult education, being national and transnational networkers between education sectors and companies, focussed also on rural development, reflect the huge range of potential users for webinars. Thus the project contributes to the internationalisation of education in all sectors,  the growing use of digital learning and better access to education for all. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the cooperation through transnational Blended Learning could function is practically shown in the 2-years-project: 14 common transnational webinars are conducted in the implementation phase of the project. All project partners  participate in the webinars - sometimes as participants and sometimes as online-trainers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe topic of learning and cooperation is \"HDR-Photography\". This highly efficient technique is a rather new technique in photography. Already penetrating the imaging world, it is still discussed very controverse, the technique is not mature and the people are still not aware about the huge potential this technique provides. Although HDR (High Dynamic Range) was already developed in the nineties in computer animation and film,  a broader usage in photography starts in the last four years. With a trainer, the basic technique can be learned quite easy. The technique is one of the most interesting innovations of the digital photography. With HDR-photography, the digital photos can show nearly all contrasts. That was never possible with analogue photography.  The image branch is well aware about this point. A common digital camera  and computer software for the processing of HDR photos are necessary to make HDR-photos.  If professionals, students or amateurs, they all can profit from this creative and highly potential  technique very much. It's huge range of application possibilities (photographers, artists, graphic design,  documentation, press and media) makes it an ideal topic for transnational Blended Learning. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material results of the project are an essay about online pedagogy of transnational webinars and blended learning . Complementary information will be provided by a film that shows the conduction of a pedagogical well structured webinar . The film is available on Youtube.  An E-Book about the state of the art in HDR-Photography with practical informations for applicants and for newcomers, experiences and new ways of usage is worked out. All outputs are available as OER, the essay is translated in 8 different languages and will be published online and in printed journals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe online-trainer and learners as well as the users of HDR-photography increased measurable  in all partner countries.  Both, the skills about realtime online-trainings as well as the skills in HDR-photography will have a snowball effect in the partner countries.

This turns them into increasingly critical elements of the EU development strategy. Yet business and economics education and training does not adequately reflect this trend.\r\n\r\nThe interdisciplinary academic field of social entrepreneurship is not well developed in the EU. The term itself is often understood poorly or narrowly. The study of CSR is limited in terms of academic hours and content. The project is built on the rationale that for business to be motivated and able to achieve a social impact, the very content of CSR and Social Entrepreneurship as subjects in education would need to develop and business education needs to grow more responsive to what have until now largely been public agendas for dealing with the pressing challenges facing society. \r\n\r\nThe project has the overall objective to promote cooperation and exchange of good practices among relevant organizations from 7 Programme countries (Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, UK), in view of enhancing the quality and relevance of education in the field of social entrepreneurship and CRS, fostering social innovation and supporting the social impact and responsibility of business.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n- to support research and best practices exchange in the field of social entrepreneurship, social innovation and corporate responsibility, in view of making business/economics education more relevant to sustainable regional and local development;\r\n\r\n- to initiate cross fertilization between business/economics studies and sustainable development studies in order to develop an innovative curriculum that fully integrates the subjects of social entrepreneurship and CSR into business/economics and entrepreneurship education;\r\n\r\n-  to develop a model certification procedure allowing business to evaluate and certify the skills of volunteers that contribute to CSR initiatives;\r\n\r\n- to maximize the impact of the integrated innovative curriculum by demonstration initiatives, training of trainers and the development of a pilot e-learning platform for training in CSR and Social Entrepreneurship;\r\n\r\n- to contribute to the promotion of social entrepreneurship and corporate responsibility among business, society, media and education providers.\r\n\r\nThis project is a partner initiative involving 7 Higher Education Institutions, a NGO and 2 institutions providing non-formal education and professional training. \r\n\r\nThe activities of the project include development of intellectual outputs, transnational project meetings, sustainability activities, dissemination activities, a joint training of staff, and evaluation activities.

The need for higher financial literacy of the EU population was expressed by the European Commission in 2008 when the Expert Group on Financial Education was set up. The rising indebtedness on both individual and national level within the EU is only a one of the facts proving the need for more joint effort concerning improvement of financial literacy of the EU citizens. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FLY project has several objectives. In the most general perspective, the project aims to contribute to the following European development strategies:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Europe 2020 Strategy \r\n\r\n     o Target 4 \u2013 Education \r\n\r\n     o Target 5 \u2013 Fighting poverty and social exclusion \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial education was articulated by the European Commission to be a necessary part of the process of lifelong learning. The goals of the FLY project are: \r\n\r\n\u2022 corresponding with the goals of the Erasmus+ programme also in the field of sustainable development of higher education and in education of adults, as the project aims at a spectrum of target groups. \r\n\r\n\u2022 in line with the Erasmus+ programme\u2019s objectives through its European level and in its focus on development of new, modern and sustainable open educational resources and tools. \r\n\r\n\u2022 increased levels of financial literacy. \r\n\r\n\u2022 raised awareness of risks of poor personal financial management. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consortium of partners consists of consulting, training and educational private companies and non-profit training and educational centres and universities. The partnership possesses the required expertise to cover all phases and aspects of the project. The consortium is composed of partners from the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Romania and the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe FLY project will be performed through activities covered within the Project Management and Implementation budget and the budget for Intellectual Outputs. Two Intellectual Outputs will be produced. The first Output is the E-Course on Financial Education, being the interactive e-learning tool to be used by the target groups for assessing and improving their levels of financial literacy. Two activities will be performed within this Output \u2013 in the first phase, participating organisations will develop the content of three independent e-learning modules of the E-Course, each designated for one target group (secondary education students, higher education students, adults). In the second phase, the E-Course on Financial Literacy will be delivered. The second Intellectual Output is the Raising Awareness Campaign, comprising of activity focused on identification of target groups to be involved in the Raising Awareness Workshops and in the Campaign. Workshops are the last activity in this Output, preceded by activity on forming the content of the Workshops. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodology used in the FLY project address the needs of the modern trends in education, including digitalisation of learning and the preference of personal approach in teaching. The main output \u2013 the E-Course on Financial Education - is a free distance learning tool, designed and produced by experts on financial literacy and IT. Personal approach to target groups during the Raising Awareness Campaign complements the complex methodology used for this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results desired to be achieved include:\r\n\r\n\u2022  creation of the E-Course on Financial Literacy\r\n\r\n\u2022  identification of target groups for the purposes of the Raising Awareness Campaign\r\n\r\n\u2022  advertisement materials of the Campaign areproduced and distributed\r\n\r\n\u2022  a series of Workshops conducted at schools and in companies\r\n\r\n\u2022  Raising Awareness Campaign is carried out\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks to these results accomplished, the following impact is envisaged. On European level, countries will benefit from more responsible consumer behaviour of citizens which would support also the economic development of EU. The field of financial education will be better understood on both international and national levels. The project will contribute to implementation of national strategies on financial education in the project countries. On individual level, the level of financial literacy of participants will increase and they will also be more aware of the risks of poor financial management. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of longer terms benefits, the FLY project will extend its impact beyond the time schedule of the project thanks to its linkage to the national strategies on financial education. The outputs produced will remain available to be used by individuals and organisations and institutions such as schools or companies in order to continue educating their students and employees.

In order to implement those new policies, local authorities are depending more and more on the third sector organisations. But, they do not know deeply those organisations. For instance, they do not know their projects, their business models, their governing processes, etc. Also, the third sector organisations often have an incomplete view of the public authorities, focusing only on their funding role. Those views are related to the lack of time in local authorities and in third sector organisations but also to the actual trainings which do no stimulate mutual knowledge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the main objectives of SPOTS Project (Sustainable Projects for Organisations of the Third Sector) is to facilitate the mutual knowledge of those 2 categories of organisations using the tool of the training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 4 partners of SPOTS project are: IFAID Aquitaine (France), the coordinator, professional training centre involved in International solidarity and community development for 30 years (learners of IFAID training will also participate in the project), BAIRROS (Portugal) non-profit organisation supporting the development of the third sector in Lisbon, Advantage Business Agency (United Kingdom), consultancy specialized in support to the Third sector, with a strong expertise on business management, AEC (Algeria) non-profit organisation that contributes to link public funders and enterprises creators in the Beajia Region. This partnership is based on mutual knowledge and previous mutual projects. . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOTS will last 3years and follow an agreed and common methodology. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA first stage will identify the existing representations of each of the 2 categories of actors and the existing ways of cooperation for building local policies in each country. Needs assessment documents and document of recommendations in each country will be produced, also completed by the experience of each partner.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a second stage, a training will be elaborated in order to better understand mutual aims and perspectives. This training will be implemented in each partners\u2019 countries. After, it will be improved thanks to training evaluations. Pedagogic material will be created..  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methodology, chosen for SPOTS Project, is based on participation of SPOTS partners and of the different categories of actors, related to public policies implementation, in each country. At the end of each stage, a multiplier event will be organized in order to communicate and disseminate SPOTS results. At the end of the project a final wide dissemination event will take place in Portugal.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOTS will facilitate a co-building approach of public policies  and develop new knowledge and skills for the learners. Those learners will be able to adapt themselves better to the world constant evolution. These co-building public policies practises will respond to a double demand: a better use of public funds and more sustainable 3rd sector organisations who participate in the implementation of  public policies.  This sustainability will be reached by a better articulation between organisations project and activities and by long-term business models.", "http://www.advantage-ba.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA200-008811_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B3"}
