Promotig entrepreneurship and new partnerships between educational institutions ane industry are keys  to success. This project is to support this process by offereing international learning environments for students and teachers from six South-Ostrobothnian VET  providers to develop their knowledge, skills and competences to better meet the needs of industry.  Some of the network VET-providers are nearly newcomers in international mobility, some are experienced . In this network knowledge and partnerships are shared for the good of the whole region. \r\n\r\nThe coordinator organisation Sein\u00e4joki Joint Municipal Authority for Education (Sedu) has succesfully carried out several mobility projects and has developed ECVET tools and processes for years. Each partner school has their strenghts to bring in to the network. Partner schools are Suupohja Vocational Institute, J\u00e4rviseutu Vocational Institute, Finnish Institute for Enterprise Management, South Ostrobothnia Folk High School and Lapua Christian Institute.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the earlier work carried out in Sedu\u00b4s Leonardo da VInci IVT projects (Sedutop, Sedutop II, Sedutop III),  ongoing Erasmus KA1 project ( Seduworks) and a LdV transfer of Innovation project: Developing ECVET in Practice.  SOWorks project is there to look for regional impact for the outcomes of them and to develop the outcomes further in this network by new VET providers and by new fields of studies. The project meets its goals, if each network school offers ECVET mobilities in 2017 and has developed processes of learning outcomes based education further. \r\n\r\nThere will be an opportunity for 140 students from the network of South Ostrobothian  vocational education and training providers for on-the-job learning abroad and for 44 staff members an opportunity to develop their skills in working life oriented and learning outcome based education through SOWorks project in 2015 - 2017.   The mobility periods will be carried out in the following partner countries: Austria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Czech Republic, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and UK.   For students the periods will last from 4 weeks to 8 weeks with the exception of the students studying in Preparatory Vocational -programme who will have a two-week mobility.  The sfaff exchanges last from 3 days up to 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nStudents in all study fields offered by the South Ostrobothinian network of VET provicers are eligible for the learning period abroad. The staff members participating in the exchanges have been mapped out  during January-February 2015 by a survey in each participating school. Personal development discussions have supported the process. The students applying for the period abroad might have special needs. This is taken into consideration when preparing for the placement abroad as well as regarding the tutoring and guidance during the placement. The students of preparatory vocational programme will be accompanied by a teacher for the whole period. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods of the students have been agreed in general level together with international partners and in most cases the cooperation with different qualifications has been formalized in the form of Memorandum or Understanding. The Learning Agreement (LA) sets out the conditions for the mobility period of an individual learner. In staff mobilities the goals of the visit have been discussed during the survey in January-February 2015 and they were communicated to receiving partners. The mobility periods of the staff are tailor made to the needs of the qualification or the developing aspect of the education provision specially named. The topics of the staff exchanges vary, being for example developing the working life connection of the education (work placement in a company), strengthening the validation and recognition of learning and learning outcomes based approach,  administrational development (quality assurance),  job-shadowing of teaching methods, entrepreneurship or international work in general. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the project we are aiming at  the education witch better meets the needs of the individual and working life through strengthening learning outcome approach to education.

The goal is controlled and manageable growth in mobility numbers. International mobility is financed by Erasmus+ programme, schools own funding and the funding channelled by National Board of Education of Finland. Mobilities financed by VET Mobility Charter form significant share of international activities of Sedu. At the same time strong allocation of resources in developing home internationalization supports the quality of mobility actions in the future.  The statistics collected in January 2016 indicate that mobility numbers had increasing trend in 2015. Staff exchanges even went beyond the set goals. We estimate the numbers to stay in growing trend in 2016. In learner mobilities we seek to pursue horizontal increase in relation to numbers of study fields and unitsparticipating in international mobility rather than huge increase in total numbers. Taitaja2016, national Skills competition finals organised by Sedu in May 2016 allows us to bring international actions in VET to spotlight. Significant regional adult education provider JAKK merged in Sedu in January 2016. Number of students went up to 20 000 when counting all education forms. We seek to support the integration activities of JAKK by joined mobility periods.  In the beginning, the emphasis will be in staff mobilities in the field of logistics, which has traditionally been the strong point in JAKKs education provision.In the adult learner mobility, we want to see growing numbers in the coming years. The steering group of Sedu Adult Education set the goals for 2016-2017 for 5 long term adult learner mobilities with the idea of increasing the number up to 20 by the year 2020. Apprenticeship training took even stronger goals by deciding to coordinate a national Erasmus + KA 1 for apprenticeship providers. A new strategy was adopted in January 2016 (attached) in Sedu. It covers the years 2016 to 2020. In the strategy internationality is highlighted and even more visible  than previously. The vision is: Sedu \u2013 local and global forerunner in vocational competence building.  More detailed description of the vision states that \u201c Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks. Four strategic priorities will be the following: student and staff welfare, partnerships and cooperation with the work life, resources and new megatrends. The implementation of the strategical priorities will be defined in action plans to be published by the end of April 2016. International actions are set to be part of priority: partnerships and cooperation with the work life. The feedback received for VET mobility charter application will be adopted as part of the goal setting process for the future international activities. The indicators of international actions will be more focused and more limited in number. Increasing numbers of adult education learner and trainer mobility will be set as one of the priorities as suggested in VET mobility charter feedback. Erasmus+ KA1 instrument allows new way of raising quality in VET by making it possible to bring in international industry lecturers. This will be piloted in the field of agriculture and bioeconomy.New megatrends as priority will also touch the goal setting of international mobility. According to SITRA key megatrends include the global sustainability crisis, the accelerating pace of technological development \u2013 and its impacts on society \u2013 and the intensification of global tensions and everyday interdependence. Naturally, these trends affect the context to which we are training our learners. International mobility allows us to contribute to increasing tolerance of learners and teachers/trainers and by this way lowering tensions between people from different cultures in Europe where the numbers of asylum seekers has risen tremendously.To name one practical example, our partner in Sweden has been a forerunner in educating immigrants from numerous cultural backgrounds. We will be able to offer our teachers and students placements in this school to learn how to see opportunities not only challenges. In latest technological innovations in vocational pedagogics we can even be in a position to share some innovations (Opinlakeus network). Aming other things one of the definitions of the vision: \u201d Sedu fosters internationality and acts boldly in global networks\u201d will affect implementation of VET Mobility Charter mobilities. To implement the term \u201cboldly\u201d will bring with it even stronger emphasis on teacher/trainer work placements abroad. Longer term staff mobilities will support the competence building of staff which for example will be engaged in education export activities.

These benefits do not just impact on the participating individuals but filter through the whole student body as a result of dissemination.

High education Level 5B: Forestry, animal care and Early childhood care and education.\r\nAfter analizing the school\u00b4s location context , we have established the following objectives:\r\n- Taking part in projects of mobility for both students and teachers.\r\n-Promoting the involvement in these programs of students who gave up school, through the partial mobilities, directed to students of level 3 grade from basic professional training and pupils of FPB.\r\n- Participating in international cooperative projects.\r\n-Carrying out different Erasmus mobilities and other European programs granted, boosting the participation both of students and teachers.\r\n-Helping and promoting the application of different methodologies which apply innovation (learning and service, work by challenge).\r\nThe activities proposed in this Project are:\r\nStudents\u00b4mobilities to learn professional skills in European companies , which will be of two different types; 4 short time mobilities, with a total of 19 days in a company , whose students are studying vocational level 3, and who come from basic vocational training or who did not finish their compulsory secondary education studies; however, they stand out because of their work in practical activities and competences, and 3 long time mobilities, where  the students will finish their studies in companies; for this type of mobilities, the selected students\u00b4profile will be students who stand out because of their good behavior and their qualifications and professional competences.\r\nThere are also 2 mobilities to train teachers in companies or primary or secondary schools, which allow them to acquire different  skills in methodologies or professional skills to apply them later in their teacher development.\r\nFor this project\u00b4s development and management, a mobility commission is set up for the first time in CPIFP Montearag\u00f3n, which will contribute to the broadcasting and  achievement of the results.\r\nTo give sustainability to previous projects and try to guarantee our objectives\u00b4continuity , two of our host partners have cooperated with us in previous citations, IISS \"Parentucelli/Arcel\u00e1\"  and North Shropshire College, and for the first time \"Edudelta\" is included, a Dutch vocational school which  enables us to improve our quality in our mobilities\u00b4offer.\r\nWith the activities described in the project and with the help of the selected host partners, we aim to strengthen the European development project; this project enables to improve and enhance our studets\u00b4training, reinforcing no t only their academic, professional and linguistic skills, but also their inter and intrapersonal skills. This will give them a sense of belonging to the European society.\r\nThe students will have their mobility recognised thanks to their  Europass certificates, known throughout Europe. These certificates will allow them to stand out in a very demanding labour market.\r\nWe expect more involvement in these European programs, both from students and teachers; apart from this, we also expect that students from basic professional training and vocational level 3 continue their studies so that we can improve their professional skills .\r\nFurthermore, this Project whishes to continue improving the school\u00b4s international image within our community and our host partner countries, all this is shown by Erasmus projects, which have existed for 30 years. \r\nOur host partners will benefit from the cultural and professional exchange our students will keep with their students.", "http://www.wnsc.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA102-036164_1"], ["4QB", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009223", "North Shropshire College", 179988.0, "The main strategy for 2016 \u2013 2020 of Vocational Education Center Sedu has paid a special focus on an international vision: Sedu \u2013 pioneer in competence for us and the world.

These students will be put to work on an agricultural company in the Netherlands or France; The countries are very diverse concerning language and culture, but also in the field of agriculture. According to the choice of the student he or she will be sent to a specialized or a mixed agricultural company. The most common branches on the agricultural companies are cattle, pigs, arable farming and/or vegetables. The 'family' character of the companies is something we find really important. This way the students mostly find themselves in a guest family and they experience other customs, socially and culturally. The weekend is the appropriate time to have cultural excursions with the guest family. We are in different countries/regions because each region has its own agricultural specialties. The Netherlands are well known for their pig companies and Normandy is known for cattle and arable farming. The weekend just before the traineeship the students together visit the region where they will be staying (with two accompanying teachers). There is a weekend program with cultural and agricultural visits. Sunday evening the students are all at their working placements and the actual traineeship can start. All students will be visited during their trainee period and will be picked up by the teacher at the end of the period.\r\n\r\nGroup B: 14 students will go for two weeks on a forestry traineeship in Estonia. For this we work together with a in Estonia. The students stay in a school and get practical training in forestry and gardening. During this traineeship two teachers will guide the students permanently and arrange the city trips and national park visits during the weekends. \r\n\r\nGroup C: 30 students will go on a traineeship for 3 to 4 weeks with the choice of different countries and topics.
