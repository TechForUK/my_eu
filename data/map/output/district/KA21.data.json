It covers five key aspects: reinforce the international cooperation boundaries, didactic approaches towards Science from early ages to the end of primary education, cater for diversity, children motivation and teacher training and promotion.\r\nBearing that in mind, our priorities are:\r\n\r\n1. Reinforce the international cooperation boundaries in education. We are determined to consolidate the work that our school is actually developing and to strenghten the communication with our school partners.\r\n2.Redesign the basis in the teaching-learning process of Science. The new considerations in the AICLE programme lead us to new bilingual approaches in Science teaching.\r\n3. Promote the intrinsic motivation among students towards the learning of Science as a subject in English. The previous aims will be reinforced by the development of emerging trends in ICT for education in our school. These new trends will be a basic tool to widen our students\u2019 horizons and their linguistic, ICT, cultural, social and citizenship competences.\r\n4. Promote a change in all the phases of education. We understand that a renewal of methodologies has to be experienced, in order to prepare our students for the learning of Science in L2 from first stages.\r\n5.Development of the bilingual skills of the students with Special Needs.\r\n\r\n\u201cScience, please!\u201d is defined as a comprehensive Project that needs the implication of great part of the school staff. So, 12 members of our organization have been selected. Their main qualifications are as follows:\r\n-Nursery, Primary, English, CLIL and SEN teachers, as well as members of the school management team. All of them with wide experience in innovation in education.\r\n-Experience in Sciecne projects.\r\n-Experience in previous Erasmus+ and Comenius projetcs, as well as, possitive attitude towards the development of the Project.\r\n\r\nWe have designed a wide range of activities that we consider the most enriching: job shadowing and teaching periods, including workshops.\r\nTaking into account the aims mentioned before, every school that is part of Science, please! will share their strengths:\r\n-Blessed Dominic RC School , London, England, UK. We want to go a step forward in our international cooperation. This partner is key for the development of job shadowing periods, that will lead the organization of teaching periods and workshops for teachers and students.\r\n-Engelska skolan i Upplands V\u00e4sby, Stockholm, Sweden is a bilingual school that effectively integrates the English language in their curriculum from early ages through different subjects, Science included. The job shadowing will be key for the redesign of our teaching plan for Science as part of a bilingual programme.\r\n- St Anthony\u2019s Primary School, Saltcoats, Scotland, UK. We want to engage every student in this new teaching-learning approach for Science. To do so, we will observe in this school how they develop a programme of emerging trends in ICT for education. This will be an extra value to our actual methodology and will help our students to widen their horizons and their linguistic, ICT, cultural, social and citizenship competences.\r\n-Mentis sp. z o.o., Warsow, Poland. They will contribute to our aims by showing our early stages teachers how to put into practice an approach in which the childis concieved as an individual who is naturally eager for knowledge and capable of initiating learning in a supportive, thoughtfully prepared learning environment.

There are about 360 pupils, 40 teachers and 8 freetime assistants at our school. \r\nThe school is located in the 15th district of Vienna where lots of migrant families live. The official language in Austria which is spoken throughout the lessons is German. However more than 90 % of our pupils do not speak German as their mother language! There are about 30 different languages spoken by our pupils. Therefore integration is a big part oft he educational work in our classrooms.\r\nOur school is working in an educational cooperation with a kindergarden, a secondary school  and a high school in our neighbourhood. It is called  \u201eBildungsgr\u00e4tzl Sch\u00f6nbrunn\u201c  and it is a new and innovative concept in the Austrian school system. The goal is to speak Spanish and English as a second language from kindergarden until graduation. There are many good reasons to learn a foreign language. As our pupils are facing lots of social and linguistic challenges we would especially like to increase their chances on the employment market later. \r\nThis joint venture is also a good way to prepare our pupils when they change school and step up to their next level in education. Teachers from each school will prodvide special support for the children in order to make sure they will meet the future requirements and master a good start. This project is unique in Austria and we consider the cooperation of the different institutions to be very important.\r\nThe teachers at our school are used to working within a multicultural mulitlingual team and will be happy to do so within the Erasmus+ team. The aim is to get insights in various educational systems in Europe, to get to know the curriculas and the didactics of foreign language teaching in the partnerschools. In addition teachers will improve their English and Spanish skills. Back home they can implement the newly acquired knowledge and ideas in the classroom and thus upgrade the quality of language teaching at our school.  In the long run this means a better quality for the whole school and a step towards meeting the goals of our school development plan.\r\nDuring the whole cooperation the multilingualism of the partners will function as a great tool in order to establish and  enhance a successful and peaceful cooperation which will hopefully be continued after the project. After all the Erasmus+ KA1 project is a very fine way to bring Europe into the classroom and to present our school in Europe.", "http://www.stanthonys.northayrshireschools.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-AT01-KA101-038861_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KA21"}
