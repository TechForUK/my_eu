Wind energy is the cheapest and technologically most straightforward way to generate the majority of this energy. As a result for this the amount of wind energy installed in the EU is predicted to increase from its current level of 56,000 MW to 300,000 MW by 2030, equating to the installation of over 80,000 wind turbines. Due to the very large radar cross section of the turbines and the motion of the rotating blades, these turbines have a detrimental effect on civilian radar navigations systems and there is growing concern about the potential problems which wind turbines may have on passenger safety. Due to space limitations, wind turbines are increasingly being located in areas close to the main shipping lanes and aviation flight paths and wind farm planning applications are increasingly being rejected. As a result of the radar interference issues, wind energy companies are desperately looking for a solution. Although both electronic radar solutions and the use of Radar Absorbing Materials (RAMs) coated onto the turbines have been considered, no cost-effective solution has as yet been produced. Current RAMs are far too expensive and their performance is not sufficient for wind turbine applications. The proposed \u2018OSGRAM\u2019 project will develop an innovative continuous process for the production of intrinsically conductive polymers (ICPs) whose radar absorbing properties can be accurately tailored. The ICPs will be used to produce a multilayer RAM that can achieve radar attenuation of 20dB  in the S- and X-bands and which can be applied to wind turbine towers, nacelles and blades with a weight of <4kg/sq.m and a cost of 125(Euros)/sq.m.

The key to achieving related goals was in the development of a continuous polymerisation process (continuous oscillating baffled reactor (COBR) technology) never before achieved with polyaniline. Enhanced control of polymerisation enabled scientists to tailor its properties for radar absorption at frequencies used by air traffic control and marine navigation. Preliminary tests demonstrate promising microwave absorption and attenuation in the frequency bands of interest. The innovative RAMs can be utilised in the tower, nacelle (housing the gearbox, generator, drive train, etc.) and the blades themselves.\n\nOSGRAM technology is poised to help wind farm stakeholders gain approval for their installation applications, increasingly near main shipping lanes and flight paths due to space limitations.

In addition, we are keen to provide support to the increasing numbers of new admissions from European countries. EU policy is to introduce foreign language study from an early age. This is reflected in the Scottish Government 1+2 initiative which will create increasing numbers of language learners moving from Primary to Secondary school. BHS is committed to providing a rich experience to learners in a diverse range of languages. In particular we aim to equip staff so that we can offer a wider choice of languages for study. In a multi-lingual school like ours, it is important to provide a supportive environment for bilingual pupils where skills with language are valued and appreciated. Participation in Erasmus + will provide us with opportunities to develop the European dimension in school and demonstrate that bilingualism is something to aspire to. The structured language learning courses we have identified will give us access to new ideas, access to authentic, up-to-date classroom resources, and opportunities to share successful teaching methods with European colleagues.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are:\r\n\r\nTo prepare teachers to play a significant part in delivering the Scottish Government 1+2 initiative to introduce mother tongue plus two additional languages to all pupils by improving fluency in the target language, and by accessing new skills, ideas, resources and teaching methods\r\nTo become part of the Erasmus community in order to forge constructive networks with language teachers and learners\r\nTo encourage language learning at all levels by communicating to staff and pupils the manifold benefits of being able to speak more than one language\r\nTo provide staff with the language skills necessary to lead successful educational visits to European countries \r\nTo provide support to increasing numbers of new admissions from EU countries by developing competence in language skills throughout the school, including administrative and support staff\r\n\r\nThe Curriculum Leader of Modern Languages has identified seven staff to participate in the activities. Two are language teachers who aim to update and improve their skills in their third language, two are school support assistants who support learners in language classes, two are science teachers who teach EAL pupils and provide social support through the provision of lunchtime and after school activities such as the Italian club, and one is the office manager who is the first port of call for new admissions.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the above objectives, staff will participate in full-immersion modern language Professional Development Courses in France, Spain and Italy during the school holidays.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits will be an increased understanding of the benefits of bilingualism and the preparation of learners to play a full part in the global economy.\r\n\r\nWe believe that participation in the Erasmus+ programme over a 24 month period will be a key component of the essential professional development of staff which will equip the school to become part of a movement that will lead to multilingualism becoming the new norm in Scotland.", "http://www.broughton.edin.sch.uk", "Broughton High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013162_coordinator"], ["1NR", "Immersion Courses in Scotland for Teachers of English", "LFEE EUROPE", 3316.0, "Due to the increasing globalisation and internationalisation of the working environment it has become more and more important in recent years to prepare not only trainees, but also teachers for these challenges. Confident communication with foreign partners requires good knowledge in the world language English on the one hand and on the other hand also a high degree of intercultural competence. Our project contributes to support our staff especially in the above mentioned aspects which also corresponds to our school internal quality management understanding (\u201cSchulinternes Qualit\u00e4tsverst\u00e4ndnis \u2013 SQV\u201d).

After this meeting, three teachers of the English language took the decision to apply for this course.\r\n\r\nThe participants attend lessons dealing with topics which are related to their English lessons. The lessons are held by specially trained and experienced teachers from LFEE Europe.

Such competences are being a team player, reliability and the ability to find creative solutions. By obtaining these abilities pupils receive an ideal preparation for their work life or a successful further education at the university level (with a decreasing number of drop-outs at universities as aside effect). Project work requires teachers to have completely new competences which can be acquired by attending training measures by performing in-class observer missions and by teaching abroad. These competences will then be provided to others at those teachers' schools and they will be part of the training of young teachers.\r\n\r\nProject goals\r\nProject work already completed is supposed to be lifted to a new dimension by the exchange among different European partners. All events enable the participating teachers as well as the partners to gain profit from a mutual exchange and thus transport new ideas into the everyday school life of the respective partners. Especially trainee teachers have to be involved in this process to achieve propagation of the project results far beyond the Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe tasks of primary importance are determined by the high-ranking school officials. The participants are highly qualified and experienced teachers in their respective fields and are rated far above average. They are the decisive number of people who immediately implement the competences acquired by the project in further project work. They also pass on these competences to the trainee teachers and to all the faculty of a school through internal school training. The trainee teachers, being sent to other state schools, spread these competences beyond their seminar school.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities\r\nObserver missions as part of job shadowing will constitute a major part of activities (during the first and the second year of the project). After a precise preparation, the participants will gather specific information at the respective locations about overall conditions and the general development of the school they visit. The participants will also get to know from up close the in-depth professional expertise of institutions other than schools they visit. They will extensively exchange views with members of the staff of the institutions visited.\r\nTeachers of the schools involved in the project will be invited in turn to sit in on lessons as part of job shadowing at Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium. They will be asked to report about their observations at their respective schools. Job shadowing at institutions other than schools is supposed to increase the professional expertise in certain areas (observatory on the island of La Palma, stay at Scotland). \r\nCooperating with the German School Department at Bozen, Italy, a team of teachers is scheduled to teach at Sapientia Ludens for a week both in 2016 and 2017. \r\nTwo participants each will attend europafels seminars about modern media (eLearning) and project work in Italy (Academy Rechtenthal at Tramin/Termeno). Again there will be an exchange of views and experience among the teachers of the partner schools and the staff of other institutions to gain an even more profound insight.\r\n\r\nMethods of project execution\r\nThe Erasmus representative at Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium will coordinate the whole project in close consultation with the project partners. In doing so, he will be supported by the school management of Friedrich-Koenig-Gymnasium. He will monitor the preparation of the participants and the evaluation and propagation of the project results. The consulting service offered by europafels will ensure that intercultural requirements of the coordination with the partners will be observed.\r\nThere will be no language barriers because the participants of all institutions involved are able to communicate competently in one of the two working languages.\r\n\r\nResults and effects\r\nGetting to know and dealing with other forms of project work, science and digital competences, the teaching staff sent on the Erasmus mission is supposed to critically reflect their own working methods and to share the results of this process with the colleagues of the schools visited.\r\nPersonal contacts grown during the Erasmus project are supposed to create long-term networking of the schools, resulting in interdisciplinary projects among the schools with the ultimate goal of enhancing the European dimension of each school. After the end of the project the project partners will send a team of two teachers each to a seminar offered by europafels. The results will then be exchanged and discussed in a workshop there.

We have already established contacts there with institutions of early childhood education and care, with a college for social pedagogy (ESSSE) and the university (ESPE). We are aiming at a mutual exchange of colleagues with the aim of intensifying our relationship (publishing work, organisation of an event with \u201cLe Furet\u201d, a professional organisation in Paris). French students already do practical terms in pedagogical institutions of the PFH. Other partners of our network in Berlin take part in these activities. Initiated by the department for education of the Berlin senate,we have lately been in contact with a group of teachers from colleges of social education in Turkey. These teachers were on an educational visit to Berlin, organized by the Turkish Ministry for Education. We had a presentation about our system of early childhood education at the college and organized visits to educational institutions of the PFH. Meanwhile, we have another request for a similar event. We aim at intensifying our existing contacts with Turkish institutions of professional qualification within the present application period. As we are regularly conducting seminars in preparation of study tours to Turkey for our students, we are well prepared for these activities and have qualified members of staff.Concerning the organizational development, we are at present involving our advisory office for students conducting practical terms. Up to now, the responsibility for students in foreign countries was with the European office, in future, the advisory office for practical terms will be responsible for the European students as well. This is part of our internationalisation strategie, to launch european aspects into regular work.With the introduction of a new curriculum there will be a stronger focus on European subjects. We plan to introduce a new seminar for students as follow-up to their European practical term.Educators as well as heads of institutions of early childcare are already active in the supervision of foreign students doing practical work there. As part of our strategy of internationalisation we will involve these colleagues in the exchange of staff with foreign professionals.While the homepage of the PFH is being revised at present, we will improve the presentation of European work with the help of a former colleague of the European team. We will install a platform to improve continuous informal communication with our European partners. We have already installed texts concerning European educational systems on the platform of our partner organization in Lyon. Further development concerning the evaluation of feedbacks from our students will be differentiated beyond the existing in the course of the present application period. We will introduce a more systematical evaluation and develop new forms for the students. As a greater number of colleagues is involved with European matters than ever before, there will be a regular date for meetings during the forthcoming school-year to improve exchange between members of staff.To enhance public relations we had a conference in 2007, on the occasion of 10 years European work at the PFH. 2017 would be a suitable date to have a conference on 20 years of European work here, so preliminary considerations are made.In general, we are consolidating the international aspects of our work, we are improving organizational aspects at our institution, and we are expanding the number and quality of staff playing a role in these activities.

Children in primary school know little about other cultures and are not conscious about distingtive features of their own culture. \r\nThe connection with other European schools enables pupils to broaden their own horizon und prepares them for a life in an increaslingly international context. To initiate intercultural understanding requires high cultural, methodic and linguistic competences of the teacher which will be developed within the course. Those acquired skills will be integrated in the own school as well as in the vocational training of other teacher in the school district. \r\n\r\n\r\nGoals of the project: \r\nThe planned project is meant to connect pupils with peers in other European countries and allow them to communicate about cultural features of their homeland like e.g. holidays and festivals. Die planned course is therefore not only seen for the training of linguistic and methodic skills but also as a venue for teachers from all over Europe who are interested in similar projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants: \r\nThe participant has designed the project herself and will implement it mostly self dependant in her lessons. \r\nShe is highly qualified to organize the project and possesses broad linguistic and methodic competences. \r\nAfter her stay abroad and the project she will bring the newly acquired teaching methods as well as her experience with using ICT in teaching English to other teachers by vocational trainings in her own school and within her school district. \r\n\r\n\r\nDiscription of activities: \r\nAfter the training abroad the school will connect with an English speaking partner school. Then suitable topics, the extent of the project and a timetable will be determined. The pupils will use ICT within the English lessons or within a Project Week to communicate about defined learning contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of project execution:\r\nThe teacher organizes the project with the partner school and will be supported with the execution by the headmaster. Additional help can be demanded from the regional Erasmus host.  \r\nThere are no language barriers because the participant is able to communicate competently in English. \r\n\r\n\r\nResults and effects:\r\nThe teacher is supposed to deepen and strengthen her own linguistic and cultrual competences and to convey the acquired knowledge by using ICT to pupils. \r\nThe school's European dimension is meant to be expanded through an international connection with the new partner schools by participating in interdisciplinary school projects.", "http://www.lfee.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA101-035323_1"], ["1NR", "Profilbildung im europ\u00e4ischen Kontext", "LFEE EUROPE", 42430.0, "Background\r\nDemographic change and migration have led to a decrease in number of students and therefore made secondary schools in W\u00fcrzburg and its surroundings re-evaluate and improve their school profiles to adjust to the new situation. St.-Ursula-School is a private Catholic girls\u2018 school, consisting of a secondary grammar school and comprehensive school. Our mission is to ensure that every student achieves their potential through the pursuit of academic excellence and the nurturing of their gifts and talents. As our school was founded by the Ursulines, we aim at creating a caring Catholic community which allows everyone to develop and share Christian values that are especially important in our changing modern world. Our school motto Belief, education and quality represents this universal approach. As less nuns of our school-based nunnery play an active part in school life, it\u2019s on our teachers to focus on a valued-based education. We aim at establishing a positive and diverse learning atmosphere in which our students improve their various skills and personal qualities, including problem-solving and organisational competence, language skills, team-work and sense of responsibility. Project-based learning plays a major role in achieving these proficiencies, which are also the foundation for excelling at work or university. In order to meet these requirements and instil lifelong learning into our students, Erasmus+ funded programmes will help our staff to acquire further knowledge by taking part in immersion courses or training sessions abroad. \r\n\r\nThe spiritual and geographical centre is our convent garden, which has become a place of silence, reflection and recreation. Its medieval construction created a haven of serenity and peace within a vibrant school life. The significant importance of our school garden is one main focus of our school development plans, as its hands-on learning experiences motivate our students and equally promote values of environmental awareness, mindfulness, responsibility and respect for all living creatures.\r\n\r\nAims\r\nEstablished projects, e.g. school garden, are to be maintained and advanced with the help of our European partners. This mutual cooperation with schools or projects abroad, supported by Erasmus+,  will secure an effective exchange of information and knowledge.\r\nParticipating teachers will stimulate and transfer their knowledge and experience in the fields of vocational theory and practice, self-competence and language skills.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of the programmes\u2018 participants\r\nThe participants will be selected by the school management, Erasmus+ coordinators as well as the head of departments. If possible we would like to send representatives of both kinds of secondary schools (German Gymnasium and Realschule), as these training programmes are equally important for ensuring the acquisition and transfer of knowledge and experience. \r\nOur participants are outstandingly qualified and committed teachers. They will act as multipliers in passing on their recently gained knowledge, skills and experiences.\r\n\r\nDescription of planned activities\r\nDuring the first and second year of the projects, selected teachers will take part in exchange and immersion courses and hence explore various methods of teaching modern languages, develop cultural awareness and will be provided with suitable materials and  ideas for school development purposes. Furthermore, they will have the possibility of visiting different schools abroad, develop their discursive skills, update their methodology and exchange ideas for good practice in the classroom (e.g. by taking part at LFEE Europe immersion courses). Another training seminar, given by europafels e.V., focuses on advancing vocational and personal skills and their application in project-based teaching as well as sharing those in in-house training events.\r\nOur school will also open its doors to international teachers to initiate joint activities and establish a mutual exchange of experience and knowledge for school development.\r\n\r\nMethodology of the projects\u2018 implementation\r\nSelected Erasmus+ representatives will coordinate and accompany the projects in close collaboration with the school management and the relevant partners.

It is non-denominational and has been described as 'possibly the most comprehensive school in Western Europe'.  It is home to specialist academies in music, dance and football, where pupils are awarded places on talent, not ability to pay. Nearly a third of pupils come from privileged backgrounds, while 50 percent of first to fourth year pupils live in what are considered some of Scotland's most socially deprived zones. The school is committed to the development of an international mind set. We encourage young people to view Europe as a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community and prepare them to take part in the economic and social development of Europe, helping them to become aware of the resulting opportunities and challenges. A crucial element of this is encouraging interest in and improving competence in European languages. The Scottish Government has introduced a key national priority to raise attainment in literacy and improve employability skills through learning two foreign languages. In order to strengthen provision to our pupils, we aim to address training needs such as developing staff competences, improving foreign language skills, and increasing knowledge of social, linguistic and cultural matters by accessing quality professional development through structured training abroad, specifically language immersion courses. \r\n\r\nWe are applying for funding to send nine staff to structured training courses in France, Spain, Germany and Italy to attend courses designed to improve confidence and competence in the target language, improve knowledge and understanding of the culture and develop teaching techniques.  We are applying for funding for one member of the Senior Leadership Team, one Pupil Support Leader, one science teacher, one social subjects teacher and five support staff. Individuals will participate in full-immersion, modern language training courses in France, Spain, Germany and Italy during our school holidays. This will be a long term project running from September 2017 through to the end of August 2019, with most staff attending courses during Easter, Summer and Autumn 2018 and Easter and Summer 2019. Intended destinations are Dusseldorf, Germany; Palma de Mallorca, Spain; Milan, Rome, Bergamo or Salerno, Italy.The main expected impact on participants is that they will experience high quality professional development which will improve their confidence and competence in the target language, as well as an improvement in their transversal skills such as openness to and curiosity about new challenges, problem-solving and decision-making skills, confidence, and tolerance towards other personal values and behaviours. We are anticipating, as research has demonstrated, that there will be a similarly positive effect on pupils. For instance, a 2012 EU study on the impact of partnerships between schools in different countries found that pupils - particularly at secondary level - significantly improved their skills, including cultural and social skills, IT and foreign languages.  (http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1352_en.htm). From our own 2015 Erasmus experience, we can say with confidence that there is a positive impact on the whole school as staff form new working relationships with colleagues from other departments and across the hierarchy of the school structure. In addition pre-application training has brought together groups of staff from schools throughout Edinburgh, along with local authority advisers and representatives of the British Council: thereby contributing to new lines of communication among the wider school and local government network.\r\n\r\nBroughton High School shares the Erasmus+ programme objectives to work towards equity, prosperity and social inclusion. The school seeks to be a consistently improving organisation. Our core values are respect, inclusion and integrity in all that we do. Tolerance and a willingness to learn about other cultures have been at the heart of Scottish education for centuries. By embracing the Scottish tradition and developing through a curriculum for excellence, and extending our European dimension, we support our pupils to develop as truly global citizens.

Moreover, the French Ministry of Education insists that all the school-children should go on a school trip once or more during their school years. \r\n\r\n2) Themes and goals\r\nThe project has three goals : firstly learning difficulties, particularly for pupils in Priority Education Networks ;  secondly, the implementation of the Secondary School Reform ; thirdly, the development of new mobility projects for the pupils and the teachers. \r\nThe project is inspired by a circular note dated February 3, 2016 on the vocational training periods of inspectors and head teachers during their probation period. It is also in compliance with the three main lines of the academic project : 1. School success for everyone everywhere 2. Learning and acting in the 21st century world 3.Investing in staff training.\r\n\r\n3) Participants and activities\r\n27 head teachers and inspectors are staying one week in a European country where they are involved in job shadowing or structured courses. There, they will have the opportunity to find out about some European education systems. They will also exchange best practices and learn how to handle pupils' learning difficulties and implement the 2016 French secondary school reforms. Their applications were studied with various criteria. They had preferably to work in a Priority Education Network and have a view of the dissemination plan they would develop afterwards.

The staff will also develop their professional motivation and their capacity to support/coordinate future European mobility projects in their schools.\r\n\r\n5) Impacts and long-term profits \r\nThe project will have a sizeable impact on the participants\u2019 competences and professional practices. It will also strongly impact the schools, the inspection and the academy. In the long run, pupils living in the poorest areas should get the benefits as the applicants will come back with new  practices to handle learning difficulties and they will be more willing and able to develop the pupils\u2019 mobility.\r\nLast but not least, after meeting and working with Europeans peers, our staff will be in a position to find new school-to-school partnerships  and the whole process will be a bonus to the educational cooperation in the academy.", "http://www.lfee.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA101-036671_3"], ["5JN", "Mobilit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de l'Acad\u00e9mie de Lyon 2 - H\u00f4tellerie Restauration", "Cafe Cassis Ltd", 262602.0, "The consortium presented here has for objective to contribute to the updating and upgrading of the professional skills and technics of all the participants.

Of those 20 future educators, 6 erasmus pro longterm work experience, 15 nursery nurses, 27 apprentices from the hotel and hospitality sector, 10 students who train to be careworkers for people with special needs, 8 teachers of English as a foreign language and technology teachers are scheduled to participate. \r\nActivities: Vocational work placements in nursery schools, in restaurants and kitchens and practical training sessions in the colleges of our project partners, as well as immersion courses for our EFL teachers.\r\nProject management: many years of experience with similar projects, constant improvements after evaluation and feedback with our partners.\r\nExpected results/effects/longterm benefit: Our vocational college will benefit with regard to its profile compared to other schools. The work placement abroad will provide additional qualifications for our students, it will improve language skills, and practical work experience which is an additional asset on the European job market. It also improves the staff qualification with regard to intercultural skills, the European dimension, language competence, teaching methods, CLIL-skills and to expand the network of international partners. It also improves the profile of our vocational school and the participating partners in the dual apprenticeship sector of hotels and restaurants in our area. Without the Erasmus+ programme many of our students would not be able to gain this work experience abroad. The EU grant makes it possible that also financially and socially disadvantaged students can participate.", "http://www.lfee.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004571_1"], ["1NR", "Un marco com\u00fan de competencias profesionales docentes", "LFEE EUROPE", 151809.0, "This project aimed at the creation of a Teacher Proffesional Competence Common Framework is a consortia coordinated by the e Autonomous Centre of Teacher Training and Innovation or Galicia (CAFI), Spain, with 5 partners that cover the entire spectrum of practitioners in the field of education: university teacher trainers, teacher trainers in centres for lifelong learning education or private companies, in-service training managers in these and other levels of education and legislators and administrators of education in general and, teacher training in particular; managers, legislators and administrators of education in general and teacher training in particular.\r\n\r\nBoth the Council of Europe and the competent National Education Authorities insist on  the need to define such competence frameworks to improve the quality of education, to ensure the acquisition of key competences in all citizens and to promote lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nThe development of the project takes place in the context of the the identified need within the European educational environment to create teaching competence frameworks and create the tools that enable the transformation  of the in-service training to the level of excellence and to ensure a high quality education.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the Teacher Professional Competence Common Framework (hereinafter MCCPD) is essential to achieve this transformation. With this tool,  it will be possible to detect, more easily, the areas in which there is lack of training and, therefore, respond and paliate  them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it will be easier to implement a reliable evaluation of the instructional actions carried out. This may lead to improvements in subsequent iteractions and organize the following formative process, depending on the results obtained.\r\n\r\nThe five main products of this project are:\r\nMCCPD\r\nA Needs assessment system\r\nA Comprehensive quality assessment of the training\r\nTwo virtual teacher training courses\r\nA Digital and audiovisual guide of best teaching practices to support professionals\u00b4 everyday work.\r\n\r\nThe complexity and various stages of pilot and planned review to ensure the maximum quality of the products make it necessary to have a duration of 36 months to the project.\r\n\r\nFrom a methodological point of view, we will tackle the task with a collaborative and constructivist approach. We depart from the current situation and experiential spectrum of each of the countries to agree on a common product of equal validity and relevance in all of them. We will build on the resources of the TwinSpace for group communication.\r\n\r\nWe will use the methodology of design thinking and its five basic phases, from a macrovision of the project: we understand that it is necessary to 1.\"empathize\" and detect training needs, 2.\"define\" the objectives, 3.\"devise\" and, therefore, develop a concept (in our case the MCCPD), 4.\"prototyping\" and test (through the training courses and the best practices guide) as well as 5.\"assess\" the entire design process.\r\n\r\nBut also from the microvision of the project we will apply the design thinking, going through each of the five phases for each of the products (detection system, model, evaluation system, virtual courses and digital guide of best practices).\r\n\r\nThe expected impact in the short term is a enhancement in the structuring and planning of the teacher training improving their skills and competences as recommended by the Europe 2020 Strategy.\r\n\r\nThe strength of our partners in their ability of dissemination and diffusion of the products obtained will be enhanced by digital publications of our own (website, blog, newsletters) as well as external (international scientific journals, open content repositories such as Agrega or Merlot, portals of audiovisual broadcasting such as the youtube channel), social networks (at least facebook, twitter, pinterest and the capsulated) and multipliers events such as conferences and deployment of virtual courses.\r\n\r\nWe expect approximately 150,000 teachers from all levels of education to be affected in the short-medium term. This will originate a very important impact of transformation in the classroom in the medium-term.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, the multiplication factor is incalculable. The scalability of the project depends directly on the success of the products and we believe that the regular use of the MCCPD and the teaching guide by the teaching staff will significantly improve its practice. Also the implementation of systems for the detection and ongoing evaluation, sheltered by the MCCPD, will ensure the maintenance and improvement of the recursive excellence in the teaching practice.", "http://www.lfee.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA201-015941_4"], ["4NL", "A learner-centred pedagogical method based on the concept of Smart City to enhance development of STEM skills and entrepreneurial competences of students between ages 10-14", "Craigroyston Community High School", 195404.0, "Literacy, numeracy, science, and technology are the foundation for further learning and are a gateway to employment and social inclusion. In Europe, approximately 20% of the young generation is not equipped with the necessary basic skills in literacy, mathematics, science and technology. \r\n\r\nConcerns about low student performance in basic skills, as revealed by international surveys, led to the adoption in 2009 of an EU-wide benchmark which states that 'by 2020 the share of 15-year-olds with insufficient abilities in reading, mathematics and science should be less than 15 %'. In order to achieve the benchmark target by 2020, we must jointly identify obstacles and problem areas on the one hand and effective approaches on the other.\r\n\r\nMany researchers conclude that students' low or declining interest in science is partly due to its presentation as a collection of detached, de-contextualised and value-free facts that are not connected to students' own experiences (Aikenhead, 2005).\r\n\r\nIn the light of above, the innovative formal and informal science education plays a key role to raise both young girls' and boys' awareness of the different aspects encompassing science and technology in today\u2019s society and to enhance young people to pursue careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nSMART KIDS is one of the initiatives to contribute in addressing this complex issue through developing a complementary educational module for pupils between 10 and 14 years that will apply a learner-centred approach. This participative learning method will enable students to engage them toward science, and, above all to interiorise their competences of several scientific subjects, to develop thinking skills and to boost their creativity, inquiry, problem solving and other transversal skills.\r\n\r\nThis SMART KIDS educational module will be based on the concept of Smart City and its multidisciplinary perspective that favours the entrepreneurship and stimulates the development of scientific subjects such as TIC, physical, mathematics, engineering and architecture. Therefore, SMART KIDS will introduce students to the concepts of science, technology and engineering with a focus on urban planning and sustainability. It will include hands-on activities on energy, urban infrastructure, transportation systems and wireless communications topics. As a result, the abstract science and math concepts will be more concrete by explaining and showing how they can be applied in the everyday surroundings. It will encourage students to learn and to develop basic STEM skills.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA201-038269_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH4"}
