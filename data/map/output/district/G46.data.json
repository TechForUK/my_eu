The Scottish Government Policy, \u2018Language Learning in Scotland: A 1+2 Approach\u2019 is aimed at ensuring that every child has the opportunity to learn a modern language from P1 onwards and a second language from Primary 5.  The policy should be fully implemented across the country by 2020 with the vision of enhancing pupils\u2019 ability to communicate effectively in social, academic and commercial settings and therefore play their full part as global citizens. In order to do this Local Authorities and their associated schools have included the 2+1 approach into their improvement plans to build capacity for the teaching of two languages. To fulfil this, it will be essential to train teachers to become confident and competent in teaching modern languages such as Spanish and to have knowledge and understanding about European culture which can be shared with young children.  This project is a one week immersion course in Spanish, which takes place in Spain and is run by LFEE Europe.  Participants are encouraged to speak Spanish as much as possible in social situations and other cultural excursions.  The methodology sessions focus on techniques which enable teachers to involve all pupils in learning through the medium of Spanish. A cross-curricular approach is favoured and all activities are transferable to the teaching of all Modern Languages.  The aims of the immersion course are:  To improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish to young learners, To provide participants with materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Spanish at primary level To develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain, To improve participants\u2019 competence and performance in Spanish and to make effective use of Internet and other ICT resources in the class.  One participant has been carefully selected from Giffnock Primary school in East Renfrewshire.  This participant is an experienced Primary school teacher who has shown a commitment to developing modern languages.  She has been learning Spanish by attending inset courses and Further Education College and is keen to develop her competence in reading, writing, talking and listening in  Spanish. She is also interested in developing the pedagogy of  effective language teaching methods and also in  developing a European approach to teaching.  She also has experience of leadership and is an ideal candidate for disseminating good practise in her own school as well as leading training for staff in the cluster schools.  This will reach 430 pupils and 40 staff in Giffnock Primary school.  She has some experience of teaching Spanish and has been involved in selecting and creating teaching materials and resources.   During the training she will engage in structured training in Spanish, teaching methods and will also take part in culture experiences and have opportunities to meet other European teachers. ImpactAs a result of the training there will be a range of positive outcomes for the pupils and staff in the school and the associated cluster schools which will extend beyond innovative, stimulating, high quality teaching in the classroom.  The participant will be able to support and mentor other teachers and staff.   They will be able to assist the management team in monitoring the quality of learning and teaching.   There are also plans in place for this member of staff to assist the Modern Languages Quality Improvement Officer to deliver CPD for staff across the cluster.    To raise the profile of Spanish, events will also be organized such as an assembly and an open afternoon to inform and include parents/carers/community about the developments and progress in teaching Spanish.   The long term goals include building the capacity of schools to teach Spanish, increasing pupils\u2019 enjoyment and uptake of learning Spanish beyond the primary school, thus equipping them with skills for learning and life in the European Union as laid out in the recommendations.The project will be overseen by the local authority quality improvement officer for modern languages and will be audited as part of the Local Authority, cluster and school improvement planning process.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/er/Giffnock/", "Giffnock Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023463_coordinator"], ["7DD", "LFEE Primary Teaching Immersion Course and Follow-up", "Our Lady of the Missions Primary School", 5665.0, "Our Lady of the Missions is a large primary school, with over 900 pupils and 40 teaching staff. The French language and culture is delivered through weekly modern languages lessons, by select members of staff with the relevant knowledge and confidence. The School Improvement Plan, and council objectives identify modern languages as an area of development. In line with national policies, we are working to embed the 1+2 approach with learning additional languages. Three teachers were selected to represent the school at an immersion week.\r\n\r\nThrough attending an LFEE French Immersion Course for Primary Teachers, we will develop our competency and confidence in the French language and culture; teaching in French; and the use of ICT to enhance learning. We will gain resources to share with our colleagues, and on return develop further resources for colleagues across our local authority. We will offer training across our authority and attend (and contribute to) national modern languages events. Through the course we will build relationships with teachers from across Europe and develop these through our pupils, encouraging communication in French; developing an understanding of their place within Europe. This works alongside our national curriculum which encourages pupils to be global citizens. \r\n\r\nThe three participants are Primary Teachers from Our Lady of the Missions Primary School. We have the relevant qualifications and experience to be registered with the General Teaching Council of Scotland. We have a keen interest in learning an additional language, and immersing ourselves in the French culture. \r\n\r\nWe will attend the LFEE immersion in July 2017 and follow-up with activities that will benefit pupils and staff within our school and local authority. We will embed the French language in our own classroom and across the school, and support our colleagues in doing this too.  We will share what we have learned through our school Twitter page and school newspaper, inviting families and the local community to participate in whole-school language events. \r\n\r\nThe long-term aim of this project is to raise attainment in the French language amongst Primary pupils. This will be done through improved teaching methods which will in turn lead to better learning experiences for pupils. To assess this, we will assess the number of pupils who have achieved second level by the end of Primary 7 over the coming years.", null, "Our Lady of the Missions Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036261_coordinator"], ["7RW", "A k\u00e9t tannyelv\u0171 oktat\u00e1s \u00faj dimenzi\u00f3i", "Thornliebank Primary School", 48967.0, "Taking part in Erasmus+ applications has opened a new chapter in the school\u2019s history. The continuous professional development and the intrinsic force to be innovative and open to reforms changed the teachers as well as the students of Budapest 2nd District Szab\u00f3 L\u0151rinc Bilingual Primary and Secondary School for ever. This year\u2019s project is titled \"New Dimensions in Bilingual Education\" in the framework of which 16 colleagues take part in various mobility programmes. The project summarizes the most important outcomes of the mobility activities and their possible effects. It includes taking part in courses and job shadowing. Courses benefit all levels of the school from lower and upper primary to secondary, both the bilingual and the language preparation classes through the acquisition of intercultural and ICT competencies, new methods and teaching/thinking strategies. The job shadowing activities are all connected to the previous projects and our eTwinning network. Job shadowing has contributed to the school\u2019s internationalisation to a great extent.  \r\n\r\nThe mobilities in harmony with the strategic development plan of the school contribute to \r\n- the development of a high command of English and German indispensable to the effective multifaceted communication inside and outside school\r\n- the extension of the number of bilingual subjects\r\n- the classroom material design for bilingual subjects\r\n- the training of professional personnel for bilingual education\r\n- the methodological and professional revival of the teaching staff\r\n- the promotion of using ICT and project-based strategies in all classes\r\n- the continuous professional self-training of the teaching staff\r\n- the motivation of students\r\n- the cooperation and teambuilding of the partakers\r\n- helping in the integration of non-Hungarian students\r\n- the successful integration of students with special needs\r\n- the enforcement of the European Dimensions in the school\r\n- helping with keeping the school in the European educational mainstream\r\n\r\nThis project is the continuation of the development that was started earlier. The school successfully complies with the regulations of bilingual education and effectively prepares students for the advanced level Matura exams. One of the school\u2019s new head teacher\u2019s major goals is to implement the cutting-edge methodology of the Western European educational system into our teaching process. The targeted mobility activities offer great possibilities to gain insight to the freshest knowledge / know-how available. The front-line methodology and ICT technologies motivate students and revitalize the lessons. Thanks to our expanding international network the students can practise the English and German languages with more efficiency. The project also helps us prepare for the realisation of the Digital Educational Strategy. Beside the teaching competencies, some transversal competencies are developed as well, such as learning abilities, communication, problem solving and the leadership and management skills, not to mention creativity and the ability to take part in teamwork.\r\n\r\nWhen planning this project, we were very specific to pay attention to all the details and needs of the whole school and its sections. We have been preparing very carefully so as to be able to collect the most diverse and variable experiences during the mobility activities. During the planning of the application, different liabilities were assigned, all partakers contributed to the compilation of the project design. The whole team keeps in touch and cooperates during the project and represents the school and the country to the best of their knowledge.\r\n\r\nA great emphasis has been put on the dissemination of the knowledge gained during the mobility activities. All partakers have the possibility to disseminate the practices they have acquired on various platforms. We have already established a new educational tradition in our district, which is titled the Professional Day in Pasar\u00e9t. This is a dissemination event where colleagues can share their experience gained during their mobility.\r\n\r\nThe most visible and immediate effect of the Erasmus+ mobility applications was that the colleagues taking part in the programme started to think together as a cohesive team for the good of the school and its students. The various mobility activities in the long run contribute to the school\u2019s innovation and open new professional dimensions.\r\n\r\nAll applying colleagues find that the programme engulfs in significant linguistic development, intercultural experience and professional revival, and all these help to impede the process of burning out. In a broader context, this mobility programme means a high quality jump towards the future, a development in the abilities necessary to meet international educational expectations and to get in the mainstream system of European schools.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever world offers you, curiosity will make you see it the way you want it.\" (L\u0151rinc Szab\u00f3: Curiosity)", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA101-047352_4"], ["7UG", "An Entrepreneurial Journey", "Young Enterprise - Scotland", 49561.0, "An Entrepreneurial Journey (AEJ)\r\n\r\nYoung people\u2019s human and social capital is one of Europe\u2019s greatest assets for the future. 40% of young people in Europe indicate an interest in self-employment (iEER). It's clear that Young Entrepreneurship is hot (and it's also a top priority of the EC) because:\r\n1. It's 'Sexy'\r\n2. Barriers to entry are lower\r\n3. There are a great number of success stories\r\nThat\u2019s why YES thinks that we need to give our young people the experience they deserve.

The growing number of unemployed youth and those not in employment, education or training (NEETs) has led to an increase in the number of initiatives in the field of\r\nyouth employment and entrepreneurship (EC Youth Report 2015). AEJ is such a initiative, a specific hands on entrepreneurial project. AEJ has developed an approaches against the current context of youth in the economy and society and contains the key aspects of a successful youth entrepreneurship programme:\r\n1. ensures sustainability of Enterprise and Employability Education initiatives.\r\n2. improves employability skills of the young people that participate \r\n3. enhances the Entrepreneurial Mindset of the young people that participate through intensive entrepreneurial shadowing\r\n4. let potential young entrepreneurs undertake a vocational training apprenticeship in another country (in this case Holland) for 3 weeks (packed with entrepreneurial activities)\r\n\r\nAEJ Design\r\nAEJ is designed for young people (16 -24 years old) with the following characteristics: recent VET graduates; with fewer opportunities, no or lack of business experience\r\nYES delivers structured entrepreneurial experience through AEJ apprenticeships to guide these recent VET graduates directly into business. Our courses and projects are always development and result-oriented: building entrepreneurial  experience, capacity, motivation, mindset, perseverance and responsibility. Development of individual entrepreneurial skills is vital, but it can only be delivered when young people have access to meaningful start up and business apprenticeships. AEJ looks at the possibilities, aspirations, ambitions, perspectives and also at the obstacles of the recent VET graduate and potential young entrepreneur. YES in collaboration with the young recent graduate will identify and tackle physical limitations, lack of qualifications, experience and motivation and psychosocial problems. YES will address this directly (if needed in collaboration with her Scottish partner colleges e.g. City of Glasgow College; Glasgow Kelvin College; Glasgow Clyde College; West College Scotland.\r\n\r\n'An Entrepreneurial Journey' with apprenticeships overseas calls for a experienced international partner.
