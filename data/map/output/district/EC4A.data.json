However, it is more desirable to convert methane (the main component of natural gas) to other chemicals of importance to industry using gas-to-liquid (GTL) processes because of low efficiency of the methane combustion process.\n\nMost of these processes are as yet expensive and consume a lot of energy. European scientists initiated the 'Oxidative coupling of methane followed by oligomerisation to liquids' (OCMOL) project to develop energy-efficient methods to convert methane to liquid fuel. Processes studied consist of oxidative coupling of methane (OCM, in which methane is coupled to ethane and ethylene and these are subsequently converted to liquid fuel) and methane dry reforming (a process to produce syngas). In addition, researchers investigated membrane/PSA separation (using pressure swing adsorption) and oligomerisation processes. Development of suitable catalysts and membranes were a key component of the efforts.\n\nDuring the first two and a half years, scientists investigated a number of oxidative coupling methods and developed a catalyst for dry reforming. The team is now constructing a test unit to integrate the two processes. After investigating various separation techniques, scientists chose selective adsorption for further research. Candidate sorbents have been tested and the composite membrane developed and scaled up. The team has also selected catalysts for the conversion of syngas to liquid fuels and for oligomerisation. They have employed kinetic modelling to describe experimental data in both cases. Finally, material and energy balances have been assessed for individual reactors. Process simulation of a hypothetical plant and life-cycle assessment of the final process layouts have also been conducted.\n\nMaterials and processes developed for the OCMOL project should provide an energy-efficient and cost-effective route to the conversion of methane in natural gas to liquid fuels.

Perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers (PFSA) demonstrate excellent properties in terms of chemical resistance in a fuel cell environment. In stationary applications, where the situation of deep MEA dehydration and frequent open circuit voltage events can be reasonably avoided, (this is not true in automotive applications) the most relevant failure mode in extended life time operation is associated with membrane mechanical failure. The use of a pre-formed inert support for mechanical stabilisation within the membrane has the drawback of reducing membrane specific conductivity, and this frequently imposes a reduction in membrane thickness to very low values. The objective of this proposal is to improve the mechanical properties of low equivalent weight state of the art perfluorosulfonic acid membranes using chemical, thermal, and processing and filler reinforcement methodologies by maintaining high proton conductivity. The baseline product for further development is the short side chain perfluoroionomer that already shows the best combination between ionic conductivity and mechanical stability. Stabilised membranes will be comprehensively characterised for their ex situ properties and screened and selected membranes will be integrated into MEAs and validation by  evaluating single cell performance and durability under conditions relevant for stationary operation and comparison with those of reference membrane materials and MEAs, including the development and application of accelerated stress testing.

Those that use a proton-conducting polymer membrane as the electrolyte are known as proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. These are semipermeable membranes generally made from ionomers and designed to conduct protons while being impermeable to gases. However, until now, PEM fuel cells have failed mostly because of mechanical failure of the membrane. To increase their durability and lifetime, the 'Membranes for stationary application with robust mechanical properties' (http://www.maestro-fuelcells.eu/ (MAESTRO)) project was established.\n\nOne of the most common and commercially available PEM materials is the fluoropolymer perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). MAESTRO made great strides in obtaining low equivalent-weight (EW) PFSA ionomers with improved mechanical properties compared to the state of the art. Benchmark ionomers may have been hitherto the best materials in the lab. However, MAESTRO proved that they were not the best in terms of durability when membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were evaluated after 100 hours of continuous operation.\n\nTo this end, scientists used lower EW ionomers in their bid to prepare membranes with robust mechanical properties. Their approaches relied on the use of chemical, thermal, and processing and filler reinforcement methods.\n\nIn particular, the focus was on exploring ionic cross-links during emulsion polymerisation and membrane casting. This approach leads to non-linear ionomer molecules with high molecular weight that overcome issues associated with membrane dimensional changes \u2013 i.e. swelling.\n\nScientists also used electrospinning to produce organic and inorganic fibres for mechanically reinforcing the low EW benchmark ionomers. Through nanofibre reinforcement, scientists reported significant improvement of mechanical properties of the final membranes and greater durability, with conductivity being higher compared to the benchmark membrane.\n\nAnother method to mechanically reinforce the benchmark ionomers was through ionic cross-linking based on nanoparticles. A number of membranes were prepared using nanoparticle fillers of different hydrophobicity.\n\nWith in situ tests designed to accelerate mechanical degradation, the stabilised MEAs demonstrated improved durability, with less than 3\u00a0% voltage loss after 2\u00a0000 hours of operation.

However, these results were obtained for thin films and were not reproducible in bulk materials.\n\nNEAT developed an innovative bulk alloy nanocomposite approach to increase the performance of eco-friendly silicon-based thermoelectric materials above the state of the art. These materials were capable of attaining very high thermoelectric performances at high and medium temperatures by considerably decreasing the lattice thermal conductivity.\n\nIn particular, by incorporating well-controlled nanoparticles in silicon\u2013germanium nanocomposites, NEAT demonstrated a 40\u00a0% decrease in the cost of this thermoelectric bulk alloy material. This was due to the lower content of the expensive and scarce germanium. This alloy could find application in autonomous systems and thermal sensors.\n\nWith significantly lower thermal conductivity of the magnesium\u2013silicon\u2013tin alloy, scientists used smaller nanoparticle amounts to improve its thermoelectric performance. This host matrix material demonstrated the strongest thermoelectric effect ever reported for bulk materials at low temperatures (below 500 degrees Celsius). Being non-toxic, it could substitute the commonly used bismuth telluride in the automotive sector.\n\nNEAT demonstrated the scale-up feasibility of synthesising and sintering eco-compatible, cheap and abundant host matrix alloys at a pre-industrial scale. It thus made a first step toward building a strong supply chain in the embryonic TEG industry.

The ADDRESS architecture were validated at three complementary test sites in Spain, France and Italy.\n\nWithin the ADN, aggregators are the mediator between consumers on one side and markets, distribution system operators (DSOs) and transmission system operators (TSOs) on the other. The aggregator, managing a portfolio of consumers, is able to offer active demand services, in markets or through bilateral relationships, to the other energy market players.  The project delivered an Aggregator Toolbox that was field-tested at two test sites that deal with consumers (France and Spain). The Toolbox contains modules for consumption and market forecasting, management of consumer and market portfolios, optimisation of operations related to prices, volumes and bidding. In addition, the Aggregator Toolbox facilitates paying incentives to consumers and billing of AD buyers.\n\nConsumers are also the suppliers of AD. Domestic and small commercial consumers have an energy box that manages home loads, optimising control of smart appliances to modify energy consumption and meet market demands. Distribution System Operators (DSO) play a key role, because target consumers are directly connected to the electrical distribution grid. On one side DSOs are commercial players, buying active demand services for their own purposes, as for voltage regulation and power flow control. On the other side they are technical players, ensuring the secure operation of the grid in presence of active demand. \n\nResults coming from the field tests point to several general conclusions. The trade of AD products has the potential to reduce energy costs and emissions while improving market and system performance through reduced price volatility and greater energy quality and security. By reducing congestion and adapting better to network capacity, AD can also reduce network losses. \n\nADDRESS has built a strong basis for the adoption of AD and interactive energy networks in Europe with important benefits for consumers, system operators and the environment.", null, "http://www.rltec.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140725221.jpg", "fp7_100636_999670846"], ["4AB", "Nanocomposite materials for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants", "Johnson Matthey Plc", "Limpid aims at generating new knowledge on photocatalytic materials and processes in order to develop novel depollution treatments with enhanced efficiency and applicability.

Via efficient, one-step protocols based on self-assembly, these sites will be embedded in robust porous hybrid materials like hybrid silica or metal-organic frameworks. Deactivation or metal aggregation will be prevented by site isolation or by efficient metal reoxidation (for the oxidative alkenylations). Metal leaching is precluded by using strong bonds between metals and embedded ligands like NHCs. Flow protocols will be designed to maximize the turnover numbers.
