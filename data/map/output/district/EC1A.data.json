A report of the European Commission from 2012 proposes \"Rethinking of Education: investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\". This process is necessary because by 2020, 20% of new jobs will require skills at a higher level, and education must raise both the standards and the levels of achievement to fulfil this requirement and to encourage transversal skills necessary to ensure that young people are able to become free entrepreneurs and adapt to the inevitable changes, which are becoming more numerous, in the labor market during their career. In this perspective, the project EMOTION aims as objectives:\r\nO1- Increase the quality of teaching and learning by improving the skills of management and leadership of training  for a total number of 7 VET teachers participating in activities of shadowing type in Granada, during 7 days\r\nO2 - Improvement of the quality of professional training of 64 students (in 4 streams) from the fields of qualification Commerce/Trading and Tourism, participants in practice training sessions of 14 days, at economic agents  in the UK - London, between 2017-2019, in order to facilitate insertion on the labor market for future graduates\r\nO3 \u2013 Increase the capacity of a total number of 80 teachers and 1200 students from VET to trigger changes at the school level, in terms of modernization and international openness by strengthening the European dimension of the educational and professional training process, until 2020.\r\nThe project addresses to students and teachers in VET: 7 teachers will participate in direct observation by job shadowing, of the way the management and leadership of training is approached in an innovative manner, in a prestigious school in Granada, and will benefit of transfer of good practices and advice in this field; 64 students of XI th grades will participate in practical training sessions in four streams-placement  at economic agents in the UK, to improve professional skills, during two years, as follows: Stream 1 - Feb. 2018 practical training (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers. Stream 2 \u2013 April 2018 (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers; Stream 3 February 2019 (9 pupils, Commerce + 7 pupils - Hotel) and 2 accompanying teachers; Stream 4 - April. 2019 (7 pupils, Commerce + 9 students - Hotel) and two accompanying teachers. Economic operators: Sona Tours, Airworld Tours, Ariana Business Centre Travel, Almont Travel, The Ultimate Travel, Berjaya Eden Park Hotel, Holiday Inn Elstree, Hotel 55, Cleveland Hotel\r\n Expected results: seven teachers from VET will develop their pedagogical skills through comparisons between the system and methods of education in the partner countries and the promotion of learning based on active-participative methods and techniques, (this can contribute to professional development and the assumption of new duties and responsibilities within the institution). Development of the competences of management and leadership of training. On medium term - they will develop skills and abilities of communicating in English, will become more active European citizens and will develop their management and leadership skills and will involve themselves in teams to access new European funds to maintain the results.\r\n64 pupils will develop their skills and competences in the fields of commerce/trade, tourism and hotel, attractive on the European labor market, will achieve expected results in the examinations for certification of professional skills, will develop their social skills - optimizing skills of cooperation, work in networking, assuming roles in the team but also personal autonomy and self-efficacy - increasing self-confidence and motivation to perform, to learn how to think critically and independently, increasing the desire to learn autonomously. On medium term it will be improved the process of transition from education and training to the labor market; the increase of the degree of insertion on the labor market and the acquired language skills can help them to efficiently insert themselves on the European labor market, increasing their chances of acquiring a well-paid job that offers opportunities for personal and professional development.

Thousands of girls work as idols and many more dream of becoming ones.

Seeing those scantily clad teenage girls - some as young as thirteen - perform to a crowd of older men is bizarre and disturbing. Yet, it doesn\u2019t take long to realise that there is a certain code of conduct. Fans queue up neatly to buy tickets for handshaking and taking photos with the idols. Every interaction between fans and idols are staged and paid for. The idol culture is all about accessibility.What is striking is the contrast between how criminal this feels from a European point of view and how normal it feels in the Japanese context - women trying to win male admiration and men preferring younger women. In this sense, the idol culture is merely a modern interpretation of a long tradition. What is new and makes this a successful industry however, is the social context of men and women who are increasingly disconnected from one another and have stopped seeking real relationships. The idol business capitalises on this vacuum. It provides a platform for virtual relationships where idealised femininity and failed masculinity meet. The film follows three aspiring singers and their fans as each girl attempts to get to the next stage in their idol career by responding to the fans' demands and trying to become the most desirable girl idol. It explores the gender dynamics in this virtual relationship and what affect it has in their lives.

In close collaboration with EPAD (www.ep-ad.org), the cohorts will be followed with to determine (surrogate) outcomes of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. \nLead from VU-VUmc, the Consortium brings together a word-class team of highly synergistic partners from across Europe constituting a highly experienced and efficient \u03b2-amyloid imaging network including the most active European PET sites, to ensure effective tracer delivery, access to patients and expertise to technical knowledge and disease modelling. \nAMYPAD will establish the true value of \u03b2-amyloid PET across the severity range of AD. Patients and clinicians will benefit from better and cost-effective diagnostic procedures and management, while academics and industry will benefit from better disease understanding, clear reimbursement strategy and more rationale and efficient clinical trial design.", 872854.0, 23827398.0, 9, 15, "AMYPAD", null, "http://www.ixico.com", null, "h2020_209458_953733780"], [1420070400000, 1577750400000, "European Prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia Consortium", "IXICO Technologies Ltd", "Background:\nThe secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia (AD) is achievable if we can identify individuals at risk of disease progression defined by biomarker evidence of AD pathology and no or only minimal clinical symptoms and engage them in a standing adaptive clinical trial, of the highest quality, testing multiple interventions. To achieve this, EPAD will also provide the analytical infrastructure to make correct observations regarding an intervention\u2019s value as an agent for secondary prevention. All this must exist in the right ethical, legal and social context. It must also be sustainable by being of value to numerous partners and stakeholders in the long term. The EPAD Consortium has been carefully designed to achieve the aim of secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nCurrent and recent drug development programmes in AD have been limited through the collection of heterogeneous samples of patients with advanced brain disease and an inability to measure effectively an index of disease course modification.\nRecruiting participants from clinics and the community for AD prevention trials with limited clinical background is both a risky and cost-inefficient strategy. Creating a disease register of people consented to enter secondary prevention trials delivers a degree of readiness that ensures better knowledge of a participants suitability and a more rapid throughput of screening for the trials. The EPAD Consortium has the necessary reach and influence from its partners to develop such a \u2018readiness\u2019 cohort.\nBy delivering an earlier, risk stratified population with run-in data in the EPAD Cohort across both clinical and biological domains; we can ensure a more homogenous population for study. We can also track changes in disease status as the basis for deciding on an intervention or combination of interventions likelihood of success in larger Phase 3 confirmatory trials.\nMost of the scientific community still consider A\uf062 dysregulation as central to AD so targeting this pathological process is a rational first step in what will be a standing trial. Other disease processes can be targeted when candidate interventions and intermediate phenotypes to reflect success are available.\nEPAD High Level Structure:\nThe IMI-EPAD Consortium will form the third part to a proposed IMI\u2013AD Platform (with IMI-EMIF-AD and IMI-Aetionomy) to produce a globally important superstructure for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\nIMI-EPAD brings together all the major cohorts in Europe purposed for the exploration of disease processes and risks for dementia. In drawing from over 40 cohorts with almost 250,000 participants in 11 countries we have the basis for the EPAD Register from which we can draw the EPAD Cohort. Expertise in basic neurodegenerative sciences, epidemiology, statistics and trial design ensures that the standing proof of concept adaptive trial will have the optimal chance of delivering meaningful and definitive answers on an interventions likely success in confirmatory trials.\nIn establishing the International Scientific Synergy Group (ISSG) we have ensured that our work is visible to similar international initiatives and vice versa hence, through pooling know how and sharing data we can collectively overcome this devastating global disease.\nEPAD Work Packages and National Leadership:\nWe have created 8 work packages with 4 of these bound together in the EPAD Delivery Cluster which includes the scientific bedrock (WP1), the statistical engine room (WP2), the aggregation of suitable subjects (WP3) and trial delivery (WP4). These trial delivery activities are supported by project management (WP5), dissemination (WP6), business model and sustainability (WP7) and ethics, legal and social implications (WP8).
