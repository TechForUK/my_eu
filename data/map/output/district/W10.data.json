There are two fields of studies at our school at the present time, the business administration and administration in tourism. The graduates of the school are interested in finding a job in the administration of different businesses and state organisations and in the organisations involved in tourism. The projects picks up on the preceding project from the 2017 Call \"We want to know and learn more\". It is designed for the students of the third and fourth year of both study fields and enables them to take part in VET learners internships in the companies abroad in London in cooperation with ADC College London.

Most of our pupils are interested in English. The school provides education in a four-year study programme. The added value of studying at our school is emphasizing the necessity of linking theory to practice through training companies in which students can practically verify their knowledge and skills in a simulated foreign business environment. Furthermore, pupils in the 3rd and 4th grade must complete compulsory vocational practice at the agreed workplaces. This is where we are opening the door to identifying our need to deepen the linking of theory to practice, so that we produce not only theoretical experts for the labour market but especially experienced and practically trained experts with active communication in the English language. In 2017, for the first time in the history of the school, we were able to implement compulsory vocational experience in companies abroad through Erasmus +, KA1 Mobility of VET Learners and Staff. This activity was a great success not only among the 15 pupils who attended it, but also among other pupils and teachers. Moreover, the school has also been successful distinguishing itself from other schools, making it more attractive. Therefore, we decided to continue this activity by submitting another application under this program. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly seen in improving the starting position of future graduates of the secondary school of business in the national and European labour market.\r\nThe aim of this project is to increase the employability of our pupils in the labour market through the realization of foreign vocational mobility which will increase the professional skills and competencies of the pupils. The subject of the project is the realization of foreign mobilities, which will take place in the Czech Republic (specifically in Ostrava) and in England (specifically in London) for a duration of 2 weeks - 10 working days, 14 days together with a journey and a weekend.  It will be attended by 26 pupils together. Through our collaboration with the ADC College in England, 12 of our pupils will be located in companies operating in the Business administration area. As part of mobility in the Czech Republic, pupils will be placed in the following companies: Account Professional, Wincott People, Yakovidis - Klega Partners. The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market. The London internship increased, according to the response of the Day of Open Door in December 2017, the attractiveness of vocational training and the interest in getting high-quality vocational and communication competencies at our school. Last but not least, the image of school has improved, as well as the motivation of pupils from lower grades to acquire vocational and linlinguistic competencies in order to take part in a similar internship. We are convinced that the implementation of this project and its further repetition will clearly increase the chances of our pupils to succeed in the labour market while also attracting other potential candidates to study at our school.", "http://www.ageuk.org.uk/westminster/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SK01-KA102-045975_12"], ["6EX", "Udvikling af VUC i MAT-IT-NAT fag, basis for en HF Science Global", "Kensington Aldridge Academy", 27955.0, "VUC Roskilde: Development of the MINT topics\r\n\r\nWe at VUC Roskilde have established several new A-level packages.

The activities in the application should enhance the teaching to secure the interest for students to study for their extra MINT topic at VUC Roskilde.

The International youth exchange will be held at Zapotok, Slovenia.\r\nOur main aim - besides providing time well spent - is to offer young people the opportunity to work and create together in a safe intercultural environment.

They will explore their own sources of power within them with the help of various media, such as video, theatre, photography, written word and others. The will have the opportunity to present everything they will have created, developed, conducted or otherwise realized at the closing event, which will be organized for the local community in Ljubljana and later when they return to their home environments.\r\nDuring the exchange, young people will strengthen their creative thinking, which will help them to firmly build on their own identity and understand the identity of others and the common challenges of adolescence that each of them encounters.\r\nThey will learn about different cultures and understand that our differences enrich us and do not divide us. At the end of the exchange they will be richer for having new friends, regardless of their differences or personal circumstances. Due to the co-creation of the program and activities, as well as informal and non-formal learning - which will always be present - young people will acquire new social skills, basic competencies of preparation and organization of projects, and a sense of value that will have a positive impact on their self-esteem. The exchange wants to offer young people a chance to meet other peers with different backgrounds - national, social, religious and other, that define them as human beings. With this in mind we will also give young refugees a chance to participate.\r\nAt the exchange, we will be exposed to nature, healthy way of living while building positive relationships with others, which will have a good impact on the well-being of young people and their personal development even after the exchange.
