They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes.

This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition.

CRESTAR is an SME-driven projected, focusing on the development of pharmacogenomic biomarkers for schizophrenia. It aims to develop tools to predict i) who will NOT respond to usual antipsychotics, indicating treatment with clozapine as early as possible, ii) the 1% of patients who will develop potentially fatal side effects, agranulocytosis, which is the main factor limiting clozapine use, and diabetic ketoacidosis, occurring in up to 2% of patients, and often fatal. We will also predict patients likely to be non-responders to all antipsychotics, i.e. extreme TRS, so that they can be stratified in clinical trials. CRESTAR will address these questions by examining genome-wide association data, genome sequence, epigenetic biomarkers and epidemiological data in European patient cohorts characterized for treatment response, and adverse drug reaction using data from clozapine therapeutic drug monitoring and linked National population medical and pharmacy databases, alongside existing European projects (e.g. PSYCNVs and EU-GEI) national initiatives (e.g. UK10K genome sequencing) to identify predictive factors. In parallel CRESTAR will perform health economic research on potential benefits, and ethics and patient-centered research with stakeholders. The outcome of CRESTAR will be a genomic test and associated clinical decision making tools, designed to improve pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia in both efficacy and safety, piloted with existing and new clinical trials such as OPTiMiSE.", null, 6438796.0, "CRESTAR", "Better prognoses for schizophrenia", "Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness.

This approach should help identify patients' refractory to anti-psychotics and those who will develop potentially fatal side-effects from clozapine, particularly worrisome in children and adolescents. The patients most likely to be non-responders to all anti-psychotics were also recorded.\n\nTo date, scientists have TRS genotyped some 16 500 patients being treated with clozapine. Integrated analysis across Europe with clinical data, including epidemiological data from the Danish National Registry accelerated the discovery of genetic factors and biomarkers influencing clozapine consumption in schizophrenia patients.\n\nThe data has been used to develop a commercially viable array-based pharmacogenetic test for clozapine effects, CLOZACHIP. The researchers have now defined algorithms and are developing the parameters for use in cost-effective risk prediction.

This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients.

The three primary market segments: Interactive Displays, Video Walls and Digital Signage; have high projected growth with the lowest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) set at 11.9% for Interactive Displays. This presents a lucrative business opportunity for a Company able to bridge the gap between the underlying technology and what is available on the market. \n\nImage Processing Techniques Limted (trading as Omnitek) will seize this opportunity by developing, commercialising and marketing a SuperHD Tool Box that will create, store and transmit SuperHD (8K and above) moving images to large-format display screens for the digital advertising industry. Furthermore, our Tool Box will convert lower resolution images to SuperHD images for these large-format displays, making it backwards compatible with current broadcasts. We have a market ready UltraHD 4K Tool Box that analyses, generates and converts any lower resolution format to 4K, as well as conducting down-conversions if required. The SuperHD Tool Box will be based on the Ultra 4K Tool Box, albeit with the higher processing capacity required for SuperHD images. \n\nIn our Phase 1 Project, we aim to complete; a Technology Watch exercise, an IP Protection and Exploitation Strategy, Identification and Engagement of Development and Distribution Partners, and a detailed elaboration of our Business Plan. The development of the toolbox and its components, and the implementation and verification of the image processing engine will be carried out in our subsequent Phase 2 Project.
