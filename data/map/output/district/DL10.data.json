In the past the exposure of a child to two languages at the same time was considered a potential disadvantage in fear of the child not being able to differentiate language structures. Emerging pedagogical theories, however, argue that multilingualism positively affects a child\u2019s cognitive development as a whole, resulting in children becoming more intellectually perceptive and flexible (Goethe Institut). Researchers further argue (Yip and Mathews, 2007) that multilingual skill development before the age of 6 may be related to more effective use of brain capacity for multiple language production by early bilinguals. Other research (Craik, Bialystok, Freedman, 2010) makes connections between lifelong bilingualism and increased cognitive reserve. \r\n\r\nOn a practical level, today\u2019s children are exposed to languages other than their mother tongue in a natural way through sounds and images that are part of everyday life and their everyday environment. This takes place in a natural way through activities that include listening to music on the radio, following images on TV, viewing (if not yet reading) book texts, playing games, and more. In instructional settings a second language, such as English, is often introduced as early as in pre-school education, although often informally and beyond the requirements of formal school curricula; second language learning is integrated into classroom activities such as drawing, singing, playing, and more. The development of language awareness and capacity in early childhood education can help learners to more effectively build language skills in subsequent school grades in primary education (Ford, 2010). It contributes to the widening of learning opportunities through access to rich multilingual content in diverse subjects. On the other hand, early language learning can positively contribute to the transition of multilingualism from pre-school to primary education and the building of functional language literacy.  \r\n\r\nLanguageGames aims at the development of multilingual skills in early childhood learning, spanning pre-primary and early primary education, in an active and experiential manner. The project takes current practices for language skill building a step further by exploiting emerging state-of-the-art serious games-enhanced learning frameworks adapted to the cognitive development level of young learners. The proposed active learning approach will immerse young learners in activities that take inspiration from real-life and familiar school practices offering benefits that include immediate feedback for scaffolding knowledge by better understanding mistakes, motivational factors in the form of game rewards, collaboration opportunities, and the development of problem-solving skills through puzzles. The proposed tools will be designed for classroom deployment, as opposed to standalone use, in the context of wider language learning activities thus enhancing existing school practices in language education. The proposed serious game for language learning will integrate age-appropriate, well accepted syllabic language learning methodologies that help youngsters build word recognition and reproduction capacity.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activities will be validated in real-life contexts in pre-primary and early primary education classrooms in diverse school environments that span Romania, Greece, the UK, Estonia, and Portugal. The wide geographical footprint of deployment will lead on the one hand to the better understanding of the needs of diverse school systems in relation to language education and on the other to the development of good practice recommendations on applying serious games for early language education in the classroom targeting teachers at a European level. \r\n\r\nIn relation to impact, LanguageGames promotes quality early childhood education through the integration of emerging ICT and innovative learning methodologies into classroom practices enhancing learning experiences for young children. It further promotes the strategic deployment of ICT in education through the design, development, and validation of proof-of-concept educational applications that exploit emerging ICT solutions in the context of learning frameworks aiming to address early childhood education needs. By building multilingualism and functional literacy it promotes cultural skills and intercultural dialog, fighting xenophobia and fostering social cohesion. In the longer term, the project promotes the development of basic skills, namely language literacy, for employment, mobility by removing language barriers in education, training, and youth programs, and ET2020 objectives on multilingualism that state as an objective the acquisition of at least 2 languages by learners at an early stage.", "http://www.edeucation.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-RO01-KA201-015212_3"], ["7AZ", "PROMOTING TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED TEACHING IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS", "edEUcation ltd", 133715.0, "The PRIMETECH project addresses the need in EU policies for high quality teachers able to innovate using ICT and for improved data on their digital competence which can lead to inclusive education. It also tackles the need to enhance the uptake of ICT in teaching and learning, to promote stronger coherence between different EU and national transparency and recognition tools, and strengthen the professional profile of the teaching profession. According, to the recent Survey of Schools: ICT in Education, two-thirds of teachers in the EU learn about ICT in their own time, and almost all are positive about ICT impact on students. Despite this readiness, the Survey revealed that teachers\u2019 ICT use in lessons and confidence in their digital competency has to increase. In addition according to TALIS (OECD, 2013), teachers report the view that the two areas of most critical need for professional development are 'teaching students with special needs' (20%), and 'developing ICT skills for teaching' (18%). This is followed by 'new technologies in the workplace' (16%) and 'teaching in a multicultural or multilingual setting' (13%).

Skills can help to secure jobs and enable people to fulfil their potential; they promote social cohesion as well as determine competitiveness and the capacity to drive innovation.  To equip people with the skills that are needed - to help them find quality jobs and improve their life chances - our society needs competent adult educators able to meet the needs of the diverse group of adult learners. The project \u201cOpen IT Up\u201d deals with developing educators\u2019 competences in order to improve the quality of basic (linguistic and digital) and entrepreneurship skills formation in adult education. The direct target group is educators who teach to vulnerable groups of adults (low-qualified/low-educated, NEETS, unemployed, refugees, migrants, etc). The indirect target group is adult learners from the vulnerable groups who will benefit from better-equipped and trained adult educators.\r\n\r\nUnder the situation of unemployment that many adults face in different European countries, when work seems nowhere to be found,  one of the options to enter the labour market is to start your own business. It is quite a challenge for low-educated adults to start their business without basic skills, such as literacy and -in the world of global digitalization - digital skills as well as basic knowledge of entrepreneurship concepts. The Open IT Up project aims to support and empower adult educators who teach vulnerable groups of adults ICT and English (or a language of the country of the residence) providing them with an attractive and high quality LLL opportunity: a course \u201cStart Your Own Business\u201d that will support adult educators working with adult learners  to reinforce the basic competences of the latter, such as language and digital skills, and at the same time, provide them with effective instruments for employment/ self- employment. The course will have a \u201chybrid nature\u201d: to teach both the language and the \u2018field-specific content\u2019 (ICT notions and business-related content) and its development will be based on a collaborative model, in which both language and field-specific teachers have joint input into the development and/or teaching of the course.\r\n\r\nBy developing the project transnationally, it would be possible to create a self-enriching synergie of the approaches,  methods and tools used by adult educators around Europe which will be reflected in the open educational resource aiming to support educators through: 1) design and development teaching and learning materials for the course \u201cStart Your Own Business\u201d, which include videos about EU start-ups with subtitles in partner languages; 2) elaboration of an ICT (innovation - communication - technology) Tool Kit for educators, which includes a series of webinars on the use of digital tools and technology in adult education; 3) creation of an interactive database of Business Idea which will contain ideas of businesses which are low-cost; do not require a college education; can be launched in any EU country.
