Host-pathogen interactions are the basis for infectious diseases, but the research methodologies needed to unravel these interactions and translate them into viable diagnostic tools are complex and change rapidly. \n\nViBrANT will deliver high-impact fundamental and translational science and in so doing will educate 15 ESRs. We have the demonstrated track-record and infrastructure to train ESRs in highly innovative methodologies, including structural biology, proteomics, genetics, comparative genomics, lab-on-a-chip technology and the development of state of the art diagnostics in the field of infectious diseases. ViBrANT will investigate the poorly understood structure-function relationships between pathogen adhesins and hosts in an integrative manner. The ESRs in the project will have extensive intersectoral mobility across 7 EU/EEA countries, accessing the best complementary skills in each of the hosting institutions. ViBrANT comprises 8 leading universities, 1 public research institution and 6 companies (from SME to multinational). The project will impact adhesion biology in general; the detection of multi-antibiotic resistant human pathogens will have priority.\n\nThe ESRs will acquire the necessary skills to translate fundamental research into technologies that will have a strong positive effect on the care of patients with infectious diseases. ViBrANT science will be high-impact and deliver 15 highly-trained innovative researchers and a long-lasting inter-sectoral collaborative network. Together, we will continue to develop fundamental research and translate it for the socio-economic benefit of Europe.", null, 3422152.0, "ViBrANT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211880_923664847"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8RE", "Odborn\u00e1 st\u00e1\u017e mlad\u00fdch zdravotn\u00edkov ako s\u00fa\u010das\u0165 pr\u00edpravy na v\u00fdkon povolania", "Orchard Care Homes Limited", 31035.0, "Mobility project called 'Internship for young health care medical assistants as part of the preparation for the job ', involving young people in initial vocational training - pupils of the third and fourth year of study field medical assistant with instruction in Slovak, Secondary Health Care School in Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky and planned number of 15 selected students -  where the downstream part of the internship will be monthly professional experience in health facilities in Slovakia (the month of June 2018). Within it they will carry out theoretical and practical knowledge gained in the course fundamentals of professional treatment and assistance, health and clinic, administration and medical records where they can use, compare and apply their knowledge and training experience from abroad.\r\nThe project allows to join the current trends in transnational vocational training for young people, the bilateral cooperation links with the world of education and work experience.\r\n \r\nThe project aims to enhance the professional competence of students not only in the environment of European dimension, but also improve the professional and language skills and the ability to exchange work experience. By using the project it is aimed to develop the skills of students specifically to work in different environments and develop training in particular of their technical and communication skills. By the means of the internships abroad to lead them to the knowledge of health and social care in the partner country, lead them to independence, self-confidence, development of professional skills and competences, get to know the culture, and help them to integrate in the labor market in the European Union countries. Students will work with worksheets - evaluation form, which will document their observations, experiences, results, problems, solutions and recommendations of internships, while a separate section will be devoted to the self-assessment and feedback.\r\nInternships abroad will be held under the auspices of the project partner ADC College London and contracting companies.\r\nIt will be implemented as a two-week internship in the medical, social and rehabilitation facilities, within the range of curriculum in the partner country. Participants will be therefore able to link the theoretical and practical knowledge and skills applied in a real working environment abroad and also to compare the differences in medical documentation, in technical terms and work organization in the parent and the host country. \r\n\r\nThe output of the internship will be used as a basis for evaluating of the mandatory professional practice in Slovakia, also for further dissemination purposes in order to promote the project and its results. The results of evaluations and lessons learned will serve as feedback for the project participating parties as a quality indicator of filling the content and objectives of this project, as well as a set of recommendations for practice and further cooperation.\r\nThe expected output is the value added in the ability of students to work independently in a foreign environment, quality of skills and conscientiously the skills and competences acquired in a multicultural environment, apply the acquired knowledge in practice and communication in another language and the ability to use observations to innovate and improve their own work when comparing differences in medical training and work experience.\r\nLong-term benefits of the project at the school, regional and European context consists in vocational and language training of students to improve their job skills, strengthen professional competencies, technical skills and knowledge, consequently attracting the school and fields of study offered to the public in upgrading vocational training, in ongoing international cooperation between organizations, even outside platform of the Erasmus+ project, and not least the strengthening of the European phenomenon of multiculturalism in the labor market.", "http://orchardcarehomes.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SK01-KA102-035007_6"], ["8RE", "Medzin\u00e1rodn\u00e1 odborn\u00e1 prax - Zdravotn\u00edctvo", "Orchard Care Homes Limited", 50610.0, "Our project responds to the needs of the current market economy, which is characterized by the consequences of the economic crisis, high unemployment and the lack of necessary skills for graduates. It places great emphasis on linking theory and practice. It is this intersectoral project, by means of which, our school plans to link theoretical and vocational education in the world. Our project aims to achieve cross-cultural mobility of students in three countries (England, Germany and the Czech Republic). Medical assistants, pharmacists, as well as nursing students will get the opportunity to perform professional practice at specialised, quality workplace. Our project aims to achieve new knowledge and skills in the contect of inter-cultural awareness.\r\nThe project is implemented by a number of activities. The first includes 12 medical asistent pupils who will be in their 4-year study programm and pharmacists. These students will increase the interest in their own studies in which they will achieve above \u2013 average results. The second activity include 6 students from higher education in nursing at rehabilitation clinic in Kreischa. The 3rd activity takes place in the Czech republic. 10 students from higher education in nursing who will be in the second year of their 3-year study programme will gain knowledge and skills concerning the basal stimulation and become familiar with nursing methods by patients with consciousness disorder at intensive care unit. While project execution participants follow equality and inclusion principles concerning marginal social groups. It also emphasizes the protection and safety of the participants. The learning outcomes which will be achieved by the participants, will be adequately assessed, validated and subsequently recognized by the legal representative and thus included in the school classification of the sending institution. After the end of the project we will provide an open access of the project outputs which will serve the general public at the local, regional and national level. Implementation of this project gives our school the chance to become a role model for other schools with similar field of study. Extensive experience that will be gained by this project implementation plan, will be used for other activities at the international level and for the innovation of the teaching practices, particularly in vocational training.  Improving vocational education at our institution motivates new students, thus expanding the educational offer and improving the opportunities for our graduates in the health professions to succeed in higher education and ease their integration into the labor market. Erasmus+ project launches new development process of inter-cultural format of school and its modernisation. The process will proceed even after the project ends.
