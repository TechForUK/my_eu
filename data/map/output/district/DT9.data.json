It is, in fact, over 10% of EU GDP (including the linked industries) and employs 9.7 million people and 1.8 million companies. In our country, the industry has, as a whole, about 191.000 businesses and, on 31st  December 2015, 886.000 employees, while in the two regions covered by the project (Sicily and Calabria), between 2015 and the third quarter of 2016, employment in the tourism sector has recorded an average increase compared to 2013-2014, by 3.8% in Sicily and 2.7% in Calabria. The data and projections show, however, on the one hand, the expansion of the sector and the tourist attractiveness of the two regions and, on the other hand, emphasize the need to provide trained young staff, highly qualified and able to respond positively to new and high competence requested by the local labor market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn line with the objectives of the EU 2020 Strategy and ET 2020, WORK AWAY offers young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their curricular competencies: professionalism in the specific sector of TOURISM, soft skills, cultural knowledge and language skills. These general objectives are pursued through a mobility experience which consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 STUDENTS attending CLASSES IV and of 3 months for 80 newly graduated of the 8 participating VET Schools (Technical Institutes for Tourism and Hotel and Catering Schools). The project also promotes the exchange and transfer of good practices in VET by relating our VET system with the training and employment system to other European countries and contributes to the consolidation of the ECVET System.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY\r\n1. Transversal Activities: management and coordination; Dissemination and exploitation of results; Follow up;\r\n2. Mobility Preparation: Plan of communication and cooperation; Recruitment and selection of participants; preparation of participants; Learning plan definition;\r\n3. Mobility Realization: Internship in the company; Monitoring and tutoring; Project feedback and experience of mobility; Assessment, certification and validation of skills acquired.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY in 4 PHASES\r\n1. MANAGEMENT PLAN AND MONITORING: the project is coordinated by IIS \"Moncada\" in close collaboration with other 16 partners of the Consortium. The Plan is based on the EQAVET quality system and includes specification on: financial arrangements, timing, names of managers / representatives of each organization, responsibilities, roles and tasks, project phases with related milestones, risk management procedures.\r\n2. PLAN OF LEARNING AND EVALUATION: the learning and evaluation plan contains specific references and commitments on transparency and recognition of competences in an ECVET-compatible framework. The documents are: Learning Agreement and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The quality of the experience of mobility is controlled through regular evaluation questionnaires filled out by participants, mentors and tutors.\r\n3. PLAN OF COMMUNICATION AND COOPERATION: it provides for the involvement of all participants in the partnership with effective tools and rules to maintain a high level of interest on the project.\r\n4. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR DISSEMINATION AND EXPLOITATION: includes phases and methods to be adopted by all partners to disseminate and exploit the project and its results all over the duration and behond.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\na. The development of highly specific and innovative skills in the tourism and catering sector;\r\nb. More competitive and greater employment opportunities in the labor market for the participants;\r\nc. The development and innovation of VET systems.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project includes a significant impact on the VET Systems through: learning outcomes achievement of participants to mobility; skills acquired from the staff involved in the project; recognition of skills in an ECVET-compatible framework. It represents also an added value and development opportunity for the participating organizations, which will consolidate a new training segment to complete the technical and vocational education and answer the demand of enterprises of high professional skills.\r\n\r\nLONG-TERM BENEFITS\r\nIn the long term, thanks to the dissemination tools developed and to the size and importance of the consortium, it is expected to have a multiplier effect both regionally, and at national and EU level and the orientation of public policies on the base of the results of the project, using in addition, as a standard model, all procedures and best practices developed within the Project.", "http://www.theeastburyhotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005725_17"], [2016, "LEO quali-TC ECVET ENLARGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY", "The Eastbury Hotel Ltd", 472814.0, 7, 39, "Due to the economic crisis, the problem of integrating young people into the labor market has taken on a character of emergency - as the unemployment rate for the aged 15-24 reached more than 44% - and it is, therefore, widely believed that it is necessary to foster experiences of integration into the production system since the years of education and training.Recent economic developments have shown, moreover, the need, in a global context, of a highly skilled workforce. As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://www.theeastburyhotel.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_38"], [2018, "Podnoszenie jako\u015bci kszta\u0142cenia zawodowego poprzez realizacj\u0119 zagranicznych sta\u017cy.", "The Eastbury Hotel Ltd", 72767.0, 5, 10, "Project \"Improving quality of vocational training by foreign apprenticeships\" aims at organizing a 4-week work experience for 26 students of Technical College with a specialist units of IT,  construction, catering and hotel management which are part of Complex of Secondary Schools in Chojna (Poland),  5-day professional training for 3 teachers of vocational subjects in the area of IT and two 3-day trainings led by a manager of a restaurant and a hotel owner.The apprenticeships will take place in companies in the UK, Hungary, Malta and Luxembourg, the teachers' training will be organized in Hungary, the specialists from Malta and the UK will have workshops and lectures in the sending institution.\r\nIn the project apart from the sending institution the following host institutions will take part:\r\nEngland:\r\n- The Bakehouse B&B,\r\n- The Eastbury Hotel Ltd,\r\n- The Grange at Oborne.\r\nHungary:\r\n-Remicro Kft,\r\n- Szarnyas Kft.\r\nMalta:\r\n- Bilom Construction Ltd.,\r\n- JDJ Operations LTD,\r\n- Illusions Ltd.\r\nLuxembourg:\r\n- Cloud Managed Data S.A.\r\n\r\nThe project is consistent with the strategy of internationalisation of ZSP (Complex of Secondary Schools) in Chojna which aimed at including IT and construction students into foreign apprenticeships, increasing the number of involved students, involving vocational subjects teachers into training abroad and finding new partners. \"Improving quality of vocational training by foreign apprenticeships\" project will help in creating the image of ZSP in Chojna as an institution which is able to cooperate effectively on the European level.\r\nA group of students and teachers will be encouraged to educational and professional mobility.

Since 2003 we have been offering to our students the opportunity to specialise in international pedagogics including the possibility to do a work placement abroad.\r\nOur International Pedagogics Profile is meant to enlarge the students\u2019 intercultural competences as well as their language skills and to help them develop a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and mentalities. Through their intercultural competences, educators can contribute largely to the development of a tolerant and co-operative behaviour in a society based on diversity and mutual understanding.\r\nA work placement abroad aims at helping students to develop key competences they will need in their professional qualification. Concretely, they gain insight into different concepts and strategies of education in other countries and develop intercultural competences and qualifications required in working with children and young people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. These competences are particularly important with regard to the work of institutions which support the integration of families with a migration background into the German educational system. Moreover, discussions with foreign colleagues tend to lead to an international exchange of ideas on education that can be an enrichment to both sides.\r\nThe practical placement abroad takes part in the second year of studies, so that students dispose of some fundamental knowledge regarding theories of education and how these are put into practice. Furthermore they have completed a six-week work placement in a childcare institution in Germany during their first year, thus gaining practical experience and enlarging their competences. These professional competences should be enhanced and deepened during their placement abroad.\r\nThe duration of the placement is six weeks. During the first two weeks, interns make contact and get acquainted with their new environment. They also gain some basic insight into the institution\u2019s concept of work and begin to surmount language barriers. In the following four weeks these impressions are deepened, learning processes are initiated, contacts to children, parents and colleagues strengthened and language skills improved.\r\nThe possible fields of work for certified educators include the following:\r\nearly education, daycare and residential institutions for children 5 \u2013 10 years old, youth and family work, working with people with disabilities and special needs.\r\nThe placements abroad have been chosen according to these objectives.", "http://www.thegryphonschool.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001898_2"]]}}, "4LA": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Podnoszenie jako\u015bci kszta\u0142cenia zawodowego poprzez realizacj\u0119 zagranicznych sta\u017cy.", "The Grange at Oborne", 72767.0, 5, 10, "Project \"Improving quality of vocational training by foreign apprenticeships\" aims at organizing a 4-week work experience for 26 students of Technical College with a specialist units of IT,  construction, catering and hotel management which are part of Complex of Secondary Schools in Chojna (Poland),  5-day professional training for 3 teachers of vocational subjects in the area of IT and two 3-day trainings led by a manager of a restaurant and a hotel owner.The apprenticeships will take place in companies in the UK, Hungary, Malta and Luxembourg, the teachers' training will be organized in Hungary, the specialists from Malta and the UK will have workshops and lectures in the sending institution.\r\nIn the project apart from the sending institution the following host institutions will take part:\r\nEngland:\r\n- The Bakehouse B&B,\r\n- The Eastbury Hotel Ltd,\r\n- The Grange at Oborne.\r\nHungary:\r\n-Remicro Kft,\r\n- Szarnyas Kft.\r\nMalta:\r\n- Bilom Construction Ltd.,\r\n- JDJ Operations LTD,\r\n- Illusions Ltd.\r\nLuxembourg:\r\n- Cloud Managed Data S.A.\r\n\r\nThe project is consistent with the strategy of internationalisation of ZSP (Complex of Secondary Schools) in Chojna which aimed at including IT and construction students into foreign apprenticeships, increasing the number of involved students, involving vocational subjects teachers into training abroad and finding new partners. \"Improving quality of vocational training by foreign apprenticeships\" project will help in creating the image of ZSP in Chojna as an institution which is able to cooperate effectively on the European level.\r\nA group of students and teachers will be encouraged to educational and professional mobility.

The exchange will take place over 9 days in Agros, Cyprus between 27/7-05/8/2017. The 60 participants will come from 12 EU countries. The project aims to train and educate youth in order to be able to fight inequality and discrimination against the refugees and weak with social intervention activities. Today\u2019s Europe absorbs two million migrants each year \u2013 more than any other part of the world (as a proportion of its population), including North America. This migration flow changes the make-up of European societies - more so than birth rates or death rates. Increased migration into Europe is part of a global trend. \r\nThe purpose of this project is to encourage participants to express their opinion on the topic of refugees\u2019 crisis and to give their point of view on how each of us can be helpful to facilitate the integration of asylum seekers in our society. In addition the project will allow participants to get a better understanding of refugees\u2019 situation and about the differents actors involved in this topic on local, regional and international level The need to organize Erasmus + project about this topic is caused due to the fact that migration related challenges are the driving policy issues in the contemporary Europe and as all the researches and studies show without active and positive input of civic society it can be developed dramatically. It is a fact that reasons for displacement can be diverse - poverty, social or political exclusion, war ,quest for a better life, studying or work abroad, which are the logical and historical steps of human journey.\r\n\r\nThe immigration problem as well as the acceptance and integration will represent the main theme of the project. The mentioned theme has keep the status of actual  problem in the last years, especially after the immigration phenomenon has increased and becomes more and more acute if we consider the fact that Europe is both a continent that provides immigration and that is welcoming immigrants. It is thus vital that the Europeans to respond to challenges in an efficient way. Unfortunately things do not happen exactly this way. It is easy to notice an increase in intolerance, the support for the xenophobic and populist parties, discrimination, presence of illegal immigrants that have basically no rights, parallel communities that hardly interact with the societies around them, Islamic extremism, the lost of the democratic freedoms, attempts to forbid the freedom of speech in the so called religion interest. Behind this stands a rooted insecurity, the phenomenon of a mass immigration as it is experienced or perceived, distorted images and unfortunate stereotypes about minorities in the mass-media and public opinion and also the lack of leaders to inspire trust and to articulate a clear view of the future destiny of Europe. The mix of these diversities with the freedom of the 21-th century from Europe offers an answer based on the fundamental European values. There has to be made a plan for a more confident Europe that will embrace diversity instead of putting it aside and willing to accept that there is nothing wrong with multiple identities. The main objective of project is to sensitize and increase the level of awareness of the youngsters in what relates the integration of immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe project will use non formal learning methodology including methods such as: ice breakers, energisers, name games, reflection groups, working into intercultural subgroups, facilitated discussion, creative presentations, simulation, case study, debates etc.\r\n\r\nThe participants will deepen their knowledge on the subject of intercultural and non-formal learning, draw a map of existing attitudes towards non-formal intercultural learning as achieved through active participation. They will as well explore the values and impact of intercultural non formal learning and share best practices of promoting and increasing visibility of intercultural learning and as well as develop new practises to include refugees and immigrants in their local society. The opportunities of using Youthpass in ERASMUS+ activities as a tool for self reflection and evaluation will also be discussed. By working, creating and cooperating together our participants will become more aware of cultural diversity in Europe, increased their awareness and understanding of practices, policies and systems in education with a view of supporting immigrants  and started to work with migrants and refugees with the aim to search together solution for how to improve quality of life. \r\n\r\nSo is time to stop the words and start the actions in order to deal with  a European problem, the refugee and migration crisis.

Improving cultural self awareness and developing interpersonal skills in a multicultural environment allows for the young persons to be better able to stand up for themselves, be more active, resist peer pressure and xenophobia, be more goal oriented and view life as a positive, meaningful experience. In turn, these young people will act as multipliers among their cohorts who in the long run will become better citizens. \r\n\r\nThe working programme uses informal learning in form of discussing, games, group activities.
