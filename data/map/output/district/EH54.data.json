The main advantage of diffusion bonding is that, unlike welding, it is not a 'fusion' process \u2013 it is a solid state process and the parent materials to be joined do not need to be melted. This makes diffusion bonding an ideal solution for joining materials such as metals to ceramics and Aluminium, Titanium, Nickel, Steel etc.\n\nOther advantages include near-parent properties, minimal shape change to parts and no post-finishing. The key to successful diffusion bonding lies in choosing process conditions which are appropriate to the circumstances, because the joint needs to form successfully with both parent materials, whilst controlling deformation. Joint intimacy and cleanliness are also critical factors.\n\nA reliable NDE method is required for the inspection of the bonds. A non-satisfactory bonding may include voids that will have a negative effect of the integrity of the joint. The challenge in inspecting these bonds is that the joining process will create a multi-layered structure that will complicate the interpretation of the inspection data. In addition to this, the bonding layer will have an irregular surface making most inspection techniques unsuitable.\n\nIt is anticipated that this issue can be solved by developing a phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) method and Full Matrix Capture (FMC), that combined with a material-based model of the multi-layered structure will give an assessment of the diffusion bonding. The model and the tailored inspection data will then be used in signal processing algorithms to extract features of the bonding layer.

The nascent technology of space-domain multiplexing (SDM) for high capacity transmission is the only solution with the scaling potential to meet future demands. However, there is still a large technological chasm between the transport solution and the SDM network implementation.INSPACE proposes a novel networking approach by extending the established spectral flexibility concepts to the SDM domain and significantly simplifying the super-channel allocation and control mechanisms, by removing current limitations related with the wavelength continuity and fragmentation issues. The new concept utilises the benefits of the high capacity, next generation, few-mode/multi-core fiber infrastructures, providing also a practical short term solution, since it is directly applicable over the currently installed multi-fibre cable links. The realisation of INSPACE approach is enabled by the development of novel multi-dimensional spatial-spectral switching nodes, which are fabricated by extending the designs of the existing flexible WSS nodes, incorporating advance mode/core adapting techniques. The concept is further supported by novel processing techniques that minimise the mode/core interference as well as new network planning algorithms and control plane extensions that are enhanced with the space dimension.

Combination of psychological testing, brain-imaging and exclusion of other neurological disorders makes the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease complicated and time consuming (taking up to 20 months). A rapid, sensitive and specific immunoassay for protein markers inside blood would largely improve early diagnosis and lead to a better treatment of dementia. Homogeneous assays based on FRET from one dye labeled specific antibody (AB1) to another (AB2) within an \u201cAB1-biomarker-AB2\u201d immune complex are an ideal basis to meet these diagnostic requirements.

Current diagnosis methods are time consuming and there are limited assays for monitoring disease progression. As a result, novel diagnostic and prognostic tools are required to alleviate patients from the suffering of continuous monitoring.\n\nSeeking to address this, the EU-funded 'Quantum dot-based highly sensitive immunoassays for multiplexed diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease' (http://www.nanognostics.org/ (NANOGNOSTICS)) project set out to develop an innovative tool for identifying alterations of protein expression patterns caused by AD. The NANOGNOSTICS technology relied on a multiplex immunoassay where detection of a biomarker was performed by two differently labelled antibodies. When the two antibodies recognised the same molecule, they came into close proximity and a physical phenomenon known as fluorescence resonance transfer (FRET) occurred. This phenomenon required that the employed dyes had overlapping emission and absorption spectra, and that the antibodies were brought together on the same molecule by another level of strong binding, the biotin\u2013streptavidin interaction. \n\nThe advantage of this technology over standard immunoassays was the signal amplification it generated, making it sensitive enough to detect small amounts of protein in human blood. Importantly, researchers are confident that diagnosis would be provided in less than 10 minutes following blood sample collection.\n\nAs alternatives to fluorescent dyes, project partners exploited the nanoparticles known as semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Their unique photophysical properties combined with their size-dependent absorption and emission wavelengths render QDs ideal candidates for such purposes. To this end, a variety of QDs were studied for their suitability to be used in highly sensitive clinical FRET-bioassays.\n\nResearchers worked on the applicability of various proteins as disease biomarkers of AD, and focused particularly on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), EGF and L-selectin. Additional assays based on the aggregated form of amyloid-beta peptide \u2014 the hallmark of AD \u2014 were constructed. \n\nApplication of the NANOGNOSTICS assays was performed on blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples from AD patients.

The transmitter module that implements the optical super-channels employs a planar optical multi-channel Silica motherboard carrying four hybridly integrated InP-based twin-IQ Mach-Zehnder Modulators in combination with a novel 8x8 AWG-based waveguide structures on board. The receiver is a fully integrated, multi-channel optical coherent receiver module consisting of a similar 8x8 AWG-based waveguide structure with DFT functionality, eight 90\u00b0 hybrids and high speed balanced photo-detector arrays of 32 active elements per polarisation, hybridly integrated onto a Silica motherboard. Additionally, ASTRON will develop advanced digital signal processing algorithms for impairment mitigation and a novel software-defined signal processing module that renders the transceiver flexible in terms of format, bit rate and spectrum utilization.

The main activities are to send two groups of students of 8 at a time to our project partner WLC in Scotland. The participants will undergo two weeks' of vocational training at local garages, have a brief look of the organisation of WLC, stay in host families and participate in social and cultural events.  Our hopes are that WLC are able to get fundings in order to send 16 students to LK and workplace based training, with host accomodation and social/cultural events. The methodology used is to offer all year 2 students at the Vehicle and Transport Programme at LK the possibility to apply, then project administrators together with automotive staff and principal will choose participants. Staff from LK will accompany the participants on the trip and during the first day of vocational training. WLC is responsible for placing our students in host families and local garages. Students will be supervised and monitored by a tutor at the local garage as well as WLC staff. The monitoring is based on skills documents constructed by LK automotive staff. To ensure that this project is going to be successful we applied for local grants during spring 2014. This enabled us to pay WLC a visit as well as inviting them for a return visit before the end of 2014.

It is therefore important that the external evaluation teams of DEY are active in examining the criteria and procedures in external evaluation of other countries, see how countries that have longer experience of external evaluation have solved specific problems and how schools can use external evaluation as basis for reform and  increased quality of work. In this project, the objective is to see how staff of external evaluation can better support schools with reforms and improved quality of teaching and how external evaluation can be the basis for innovation and development of teaching methods.Follow-up of external evaluation and utilization of the results is a task that many countries struggle with and considering the number of staff working within inspections and evaluations, it is of high importance that the work improves the quality of work with children. The course on Appreciative Inquiry, strength-based approach to implement positive change, which is also part of this project, directly supports this objective. Participants in the project are the persons responsible for both the external evaluation work and policy making in the field and therefore directly use the knowledge and the experience gained. These are pre-school advisors on the external evaluation team and evaluators responsible for reporting and communication with school management. In September 2016, the Inspection offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland will be visited (Education Scotland and The Education and Training Inspectorate).

Professional, cultural, and linguistic preparation of student. Arrangements of logistic matters and the student\u2019s training agreement i.e. training activities, practical and legal matters. A mentor arrangement is established in the hosting company and the stay is monitored, assessed and validated in line with Kold College\u2019s standards and the conventions of ECVET and EQF. Outcomes of validation are documented in the Danish portfolio system, Elevplan and Europass mobility pass.In order to increase the knowledge of the project results, a number of dissemination activities are carried out and targeted to the stakeholders of Kold College, which count college networks, local educational committees, youth guidance centres and other local and regional collaborators, teachers, the management and the board of Kold College, the students of the college and other national and international educational institutions. The dissemination of the result of the project is done by using the website of the college, its Facebook profile, APPs, Intranet and video spots at the college, articles in local press etc. Further, dissemination is done in a number of meeting forums with stakeholders like meetings with teachers, managers, the board of directors, the board, the students\u2019 school council and the audience of the annual international EFVET conference for the VET sector.
