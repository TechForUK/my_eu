The action begins with a review of the market, which is necessary during the current economic crisis: a lack of employment coexists with a lack of specific skills. Hence the need to train updated professionals with digital and language skills. Learners ask for synergies with the market, especially in Europe, and contacts with the outside world, along with forms of creative learning, informal, close to the world of young people suitable to awaken interest and creativity.\r\n\r\nGiven digital natives' skills, it is productive to exploit and hand over them to the vocational field in order  to create jobs. Moreover nowadays it's essential to be present in the market, to promote our image: a future professional must know the importance of social media marketing especially in our society where making others speak about us is fundamental and in which social media are necessary to create a brand identity and a brand reputation.\r\n\r\nThe group is made of 65 students attending the 4-5 class (catering, tourism, administration and marketing), 15 recent graduates from our school and 25 VET staff (teachers and employees). After a preparation on SMmarketing, a 3-week mobility will be following for learners in order to develop sector-based skills with a focus on the product image, food design and promotional strategies on the web. The mobilities of the staff, lasting 9 days, will be concentrated on jobshadowing in companies active in web marketing and Ecommerce along with visits to leading companies. On the return the learners will produce a marketing campaign choosing the most effective social media or mobile apps; it will be voted by counting the I Like or Tweet obtained. Among the 10 most voted, the winner will be declared and awarded by a group of experts in a final ceremony, giving popularity to the project and contacts with the territory. ATA employees will create a FB or TW page of the school, will keep it updated and the teachers will produce a SMmarketing  Ebook .The staff will put into practice the acquired skills by taking part in the contest \u201cTake pics of our School\u201d: the aim is telling the school mission with Instagram shots, with posts on FB-TW and links on FB and the new school web page.The outputs will make the program popular and will help achieving its outcomes. Sustainability will be offered by:\r\n\r\n- FB page which will go on living and being updated\r\n\r\n- the Ebook which will be used as future teaching material, for the next UDA of 4th and 5th class and as simplified or different learning curricula\r\n\r\n- the contest \u201cTake pics of our school\u201d and ' Take the shot ' that will represent examples of good practice.The methodologies used will be: cooperative learning, E-learning, problem solving, suitable to improve quality and effectiveness of education, promote creativity and innovation with formal and informal learning and to spread the concept of learning to learn. Throughout the target group, education - therefore the owned and acquired knowledge and skills - will be converted in research and put into practice to drive innovation.The overall impact expected will be the building up of transversal skills to offer job opportunities to  learners and the acquisition of autonomy and self-esteem; personal and professional fulfillment and greater mobility in EU with a view on lifelong learning to the whole target.\r\n\r\nAnother impact will be to update learning and reduce the generational gap between students and staff which often causes frustration and lack of communication in order to live school in a positive, motivated way in a relaxing and well-being atmosphere.
