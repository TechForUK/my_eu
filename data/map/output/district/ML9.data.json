This is in response the the Scottish Government 1+2 initiative which recommends that pupils learn a foreign language from P1 throughout the school.  In order to address this a working party has been set up in the school the applicant for the immersion course is involved in this.  One of the challenges of the 1+2 initiative is that all teachers will be expected to teach the target language at a basic level and not all teachers have been trained.  The applicant has identified in her Professional Review and Development a need to refresh her conversational French as well as teaching styles and resources.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to:\r\n1. Provide training for the applicant in cultural education, language and teaching styles.\r\n2. For the applicant to support all staff in the school and learning community in teaching French.\r\n3. For the applicant to share expertise in terms of strategies, activities and pedagogy in embedding the French language throughout the school with a view to moving away from discreet teaching.\r\n\r\nThe applicant will also share her experience with pupils and parents and the local community as we look at ways to share our learning.\r\n\r\nThe short and long -term benefits of the project will be ascertained on a regular basis via questionnaires, forward plan reviews and classroom observations.  \r\n\r\nThe knowledge and expertise gained through the project will consequently allow the school to explore the introduction of a 2nd additional language in P6 and P7.", null, "Stonehouse Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001884_coordinator"], ["3HG", "Language Training", "Newfield Primary School", 1888.0, "This training will allow our staff member to learn a modern language in more depth as well as more methods of delivering French to pupils in school. It will support our establishment in meeting the guidance provided for modern languages via the Curriculum for Excellence in particular, we will be able to work towards achieving successful implementation of the modern languages policy 'Language Learning in Scotland: A1+2'. It will also be an excellent opportunity to form relationships with partners abroad. The pupils will be able to communicate with other school in the UK and abroad using modern technology. The project itself is an ongoing learning process which initially began in October 2014 and will continue into 2015 and thereafter. In October 2016 it will be possible for Newfield to build on the initial implementation. The LFEE will support the candidate support, during and after the immersion course. The objectives of the project will be to improve the candidates personal linguistic skills and provide supportive materials and methodology techniques to deliver the teaching of modern languages to young children. This learning will then be shared with staff members within and out with Newfield for maximum benefit. There will be one participant for our school and her enthusiasm, hard working attitude and drive to succeed will ensure successful implementation of a modern language programme on return. The activities during the training will teach important vocabulary and greetings. It will immerse the teacher in French culture and provide many opportunities for discussion and reflection on how the materials will support the specific needs of the school. The methodology to deliver this training will include trained modern language teachers who are native to France. Resources provided will be supportive and will include links to modern technology, games and exciting activities which will help demonstrate how best to teach French to the pupils. This experience will hugely improve the candidates confidence, knowledge, skills and abilities in teaching modern languages to young people. It will also enable them to train and support other teaching staff. There will also be possibilities to share what has been learned with parents and involve local businesses to support and encourage a European dimension within the school. By 2020, the school will have fully implemented a 'Language Learning in Scotland: A1+2 approach' policy. All members of staff will be trained and pupils from primary 1-7 will have the opportunity to learn and become passionate about modern languages. Newfield will become more culturally aware and will be a lending school in demonstrating the importance of modern languages.", "http://www.newfield-pri.s-lanark.sch.uk", "Newfield Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023146_coordinator"], ["1EL", "Language Training", "Craigbank Primary School", 1888.0, "We are applying for funding to support our Principal Teacher in attending an immersion course in Lyon, France provided by Language for Education Europe. This immersion course will support our Principal Teacher in extending her skill and expertise in teaching French to children in Craigbank Primary School. This is an application for one applicant who has just begun a 12 week course on primary language learning delivered by LFEE. She has a love of learning languages, reflected in her 01/10/2015revious qualifications at higher level. As Principal Teacher at Craigbank, she will lead learning across the school. The LFEE immersion course will provided tuition, cultural activities, resources and copious opportunities to develop partnerships and professional connections. She will return with valuable resources which will be shared with all staff, ideas on how to embed the French language in our everyday practice, she will be more confident in leading French language learning in the school. The immersion course will also provide our Principal Teacher with key professional contacts which she will maintain on return in order to enhance learning experiences for children in  our school and learning community. She will share her knowledge with staff through informal meetings and formal, structures training sessions to ensure that consistently good practice is used throughout our school. It will also enable us as a school to develop and enhance the cultural awareness of contemporary French culture which will be achieved by using knowledge gained on the course to organize events such as a French Cafe and French sports tournaments. We also hope to use the knowledge, experience and expertise gained during this course to run parent workshops which will be led by the pupils in the school in order to share their knowledge and extend learning out in to our community. Staff in the school will hopefully be inspired to apply for a similar course in the future too. Long term, this should positively influence the approaches and methodologies used at cluster level and all staff will be encouraged to share good practice across local schools.
