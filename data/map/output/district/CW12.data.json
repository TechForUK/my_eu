I 2017 we plan a consortium with staff mobility, where 8 out of 10 of the upper secondary schools in our region will take part in a Erasmus+ prosject. Together with 3 other local partners we also apply for a partnership project that will benefit one school in the first place and more schools in the long term perspective. Mobility for apprentices in VET is considered a very interesting possibility to make vocational training attractive, and to offer something extra for young persons who need more challenges and who are curious about other countries and vocational training abroad. Hopefully all the activities will contribute to a stronger focus and improved motivation for international experience and competence in our whole region in the educational sector.  It is also regarded as an advantage to implement more than 1 action and to benefit from the different initiatives for more than one target group. Placements for apprentices have become even more important with regard to the challenges common to Europe at the moment; to counteract prejudice and negative attitude towards immigrants and people from other countries. Meetings between peers across borders is a perfect way of reducing fear of strangers, and at the same time we make Norwegian vocational education known abroad. We apply for more or less the same number of mobilities as last time, for the same periods/weeks. \r\nFor the next period we will also continue our work with designing new documents. It takes a lot of time to test learning agreements and make them suitable for our target group. I 2016 we have made different versions of learning agreements, Memorandum of Understanding, evaluation forms, and plans for handling crisis. We also made a new leaflet presenting the offer of placements to curious apprentices. The work with all the documents is an important contribution to the quality assurance for the projects, but it is also demanding. They need to be accurate and precise, and also useful and understandable for all parties. \r\nIn 2016-2017 we have started cooperating with a new partner in Malta.

This document increases their career prospects on the national and European job market. \r\nOur collaboration with regional companies that employ apprentices of our foreign project partners, often results in the decrease of language barriers and more cultural acceptance. By implementing our European mobilities we spread the idea of Europe within the GEK and also on a regional level.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA116-004540_5"], ["3JZ", "Bevegelser i fagoppl\u00e6ring", "Optimum Social Care Initiatives Limited", 151004.0, "For more than 20 years our county has offered Erasmus + placements to apprentices as a centralized measure organized by the county council in stead of separate companies or training offices.  Using Erasmus+ and other EU programs  is a part of a regional political strategy focusing on using internationalization as a tool to perform the tasks performed by our organsation and to improve the quality of the services we offer in the region. The main aim of our institution and educational policy is to combat early school leaving. Working with Erasmus+ and offering placements is a way to motivate pupils for choosing vocational training and to finish school and training because they can spend some time abroad during their apprenticeship period. \r\n\r\nThis project will be one of 3 actions that will be coordinated by Vestfold county council the next few years. I 2017 we planned a consortium with staff mobility, where 8 out of 10 of the upper secondary schools in our region will take part in a Erasmus+ prosject. We write a new applicaton for staff mobility in 2018.  We have also received funding for a partnership project which will start in 2018. Mobility for apprentices in VET is considered a very interesting possibility to make vocational training attractive, and to offer something extra for young persons who need more challenges and who are curious about other countries and vocational training abroad. Hopefully all the activities will contribute to a stronger focus and improved motivation for international experience and competence in our whole region in the educational sector.  It is also regarded as an advantage to implement more than 1 action and to benefit from the different initiatives for more than one target group. Placements for apprentices have become even more important with regard to the challenges common to Europe at the moment; to counteract prejudice and negative attitude towards immigrants and people from other countries. Meetings between peers across borders is a perfect way of reducing fear of strangers, and at the same time we make Norwegian vocational education known abroad. \r\n\r\nWe apply for more or less the same number of mobilities as last time, for the same periods/weeks. In 2018 we add the possibility of staying 13 weeks in Dublin, Ireland, which is now possible. Our regional partner, the training office for the restaurant and food business, have asked for help to encourage pupils to choose apprenticeships as cooks and waiters. They have already been to a preparatory visit to a new partner in Italy. Together we would like to offer 2 weeks' placements for new apprentices in a wine district. This will be advertised to create interest in these professions. \r\n\r\nFor the next period we will also continue our work with designing new documents. It takes a lot of time to test learning agreements and make them suitable for our target group. The work with all the documents is an important contribution to the quality assurance for the projects, but it is also demanding. They need to be accurate and precise, and also useful and understandable for all parties. In 2018 we will also pay more attention to different arenas for sharing results. We realise that we have done quite a lot of work already, but we can make a better system and plan for this. We have several arenas where we share and inform about our Erasmus+ activities, but we would like to make this more visible. \r\n\r\nAs usual we think it is necessary to include accompanying persons for travel companions or visits during the placements of 13 weeks. We tend to think that most young persons travel a lot, but every year we meet young persons who are not experienced in travelling and who benefit greatly from an accompanying person. This makes a safer arrival or a chance to adjust the tasks given in a company when somebody visits. We must bear in mind that we work with young persons who are not always comfortable with raising their voices and asking for changes and need some assistance in this process.  An accompanying person is another safety and quality measure. In addition to that, an accompanying person is also one of the sharing tools, where an adult working in a company or training office experience what is going on during a placement and will market it to other persons and share his/her story with colleagues. For the new group mobility in the restaurant and food business we want to include an accompanying person for teh whole period og 2 weeks. This group will consist of new apprentices and are a little bit younger than our traditional mobility groups.  Using accompanying persons is an important  quality measure.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-NO01-KA116-038630_1"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1QJ", "HMK TECHNICAL SERVICES LIMITED", 637612.0, "Making the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system (08.02.03.03)", "fts_2017_1355", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CW12"}
