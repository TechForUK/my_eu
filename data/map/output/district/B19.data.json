Project will advance recent innovations towards preparation of ordered nanoporous, nanostructured materials using anodisation methods and applying them to develop commercially relevant novel materials and address the market potential for these improved materials. The nanostructuring process is the growth, during the anodising process, of nanoporous films consisting of well-ordered pores of Anodic Al Oxide in hexagonally close-packed distribution with large aspect ratio. The concept of self-assembly is not yet implemented in actual anodising Al processes due to a number of bottle-necks; project aims at developing pilot line equipment and methodologies enabling to overcome them. The objective is to solve actual market needs by achieving the single stage treatment and industrial evaluation of nanostructured aluminium alloys. The overall research methodology of the Nanocoat project will follow a progression from detailed laboratory studies through scale-up to applications testing on industrial aluminium grades under industrial relevant conditions, to evaluate their structural and functional characteristics, the reproducibility of the process, and to deliver to end-users suitable test structures as predemonstrators. It is expected that on controlling the formation of the anodised nano-size cell structures on aluminium it will be possible to achieve novel performance in terms of adherence, wettability, corrosion and wear, and adsorption/absorption properties. The scope of applications is very large in the field of surface engineering. The specific anodising markets to be addressed during the project are concerned with improved functionality and new coatings for traditional anodisation processes. In addition, new markets will be assessed, which are based on the enhanced performance of these coatings.", 102153.0, 1279816.0, "NANOCOAT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.ashton-moore.co.uk", null, "fp7_96899_984498494"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3JG", "Talented Children", "TITAN PARTNERSHIP LTD", 81302.0, "This partnership consists of three partners from three countries in order to explore and find the best practice in early identification and support of talents. As each partner represents different sector of education, we will be a multi-player partnership which will be able to cover more aspects of our topic.

The partnership address to Strategic objective 2: Improving the quality and efficiency of education and training in \u2018ET 2020\u2019.  There is a need to ensure high quality teaching, to provide continuous professional development for teachers and trainers teachers and other educational specialists. Our project will upskill teachers in early identification of talented children and learn them to create an individual and special educational plans for those children. Strategic objective 3: Promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship says that education and training systems should aim to ensure that all learners - including those from disadvantaged backgrounds, those with special needs and migrants - complete their education. We want our schools to be ready to create an atmosphere of acceptance and recognition of gifted and talented children from any background in any country. This includes knowledge and skills in early identification of the talented child, supporting that child and involving parents and the family in the process of his/her education. To reach these objectives our partnership will realize study visits in partner countries in order to learn what works well through observation, discussion and other methods. The information and skills will be confirmed and widen on seminars which will be organized during the study visits. Leading professionals will be invited to provide participants with updated scientific findings. Each study visit and seminar will be focused on specific aspect of talented and gifted children. We will learn about tools of early identification of those who are talented or gifted in the Czech Republic, we will explore and compare tools and possibilities to support and teach talents in the United Kingdom and we will also observe teachers\u00b4 education and training in teaching talented children in Turkey. The information and knowledge gained in the project will be collected in Methodology for Teachers (\u201cDiscovering and Support of Talented Children\u201d) which will be distributed to teachers in pre-primary, primary, secondary and upper education, to school management, psychologists, school counsellors and careers counsellors, members of academic staff at universities and other professionals in identification, education and support of talented children. Effective and equal educational system is considered essential for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. That is  why we will appeal strategists and decision makers in order to support talents. We will create the Recommendation Paper which will contain recommendation of participants in the field of education of talents. Our project will upskill almost 80 related staff. Participants are expected to cascade the information to the others. This will ensure the sustainability of the project acitivites.\r\nThe project concludes with a final conference in the United Kingdom aimed at disseminating practice as wide as possible and attended by delegates from all partners as well as a wide range of invited delegates.", "http://www.titan.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-CZ01-KA201-002059_2"], ["3JG", "The European Engagement in Kids Achievement Project", "TITAN PARTNERSHIP LTD", 83371.0, "Context and ObjectivesThe Eureka Project will contribute to addressing the EU 2020 targets of Reducing the rates of early school leaving below 10% by supporting students at the highest end of the spectrum. In particular it will also address two of the 2009 ET 2020 EU objectives to address challenges in education and training systems by 2020: 1. Improving the quality and efficiency of education and training; and 2. Promoting equity, social cohesion, and active citizenship. Our project will upskill teachers and other professionals in the early identification of the most able students. There is a significant need to ensure high quality teaching, to provide adequate initial teacher education, continuous professional development for teachers and trainee teachers and other educational specialists. Importantly our project will also provide resources to enable successful and powerful impacts by staff with more able students once identified.Number and Profile of ParticipantsWe have formed a partnership across 4 countries to build on the work of the Talented Child Project (www.talentedchildproject.eu) which exchanged best practice in this field. We wish to put in place resources and training as a result of this collaboration and include the contributions of new partners in the UK, Greece and Ireland who can provide added benefits. The partnership is led by TITAN Partnership Ltd in the UK who lead on Most Able initiatives in a large area of Birmingham. Titan has worked with KPPP Zl\u00edn on the Talented Child project and has formed a strong bond for development. Birmingham City University, a Higher Education establishment in the UK, has significant expertise in teacher development and course design and will contribute this to the EUREKA project, a gap in work in this field to date. Ellinogermaniki Agogi, a school in Greece with a large research and development unit, brings great research and creative skills to the partnership and will use this to help develop significant resources whilst GRETB, through two of its highest achieving secondary schools, will contribute expertise from a highly innovative setting in Ireland.ParticipantsWe aim to target teachers, educational psychologists and others who touch on the education of children such as guidance specialists/teaching assistants and other counsellors. In addition we will involve managers of schools providing primary/secondary education including governors (a recommendation of Ofsted in the UK), teaching institutions and universitiesDescription of ActivitiesThe Eureka Project will develop 2 training courses which will be certified by institutions in the UK and the Czech Republic and these will be delivered to participants. These courses will be transferable to other organisations across Europe through availability on websites and through personal contact. They will be developed through a range of professionals including Higher Education Institutions and Educational Psychological Services who are at the forefront of delivery in their respective countries. They will have a multi-disciplinary focus as a consequence and will be developed through audit and analysis of best practice. The training will include modules on identification and interventions to enable Most Able students to fully realise their potential. Two manuals in addition will be developed by partners on these topics through the exchange of practice at transnational meetings. These manuals will be easy to use and will include case studies in a variety of formats.MethodologyWe have formed a partnership which brings a huge array of talent and experience to this project from different settings across Europe. We plan to have lead organisations covering topics relevant to their strengths and for transnational meetings to be used to exchange practice and develop frameworks and content for our products. All our outcomes will be available through online resources which are free to use. The partnership includes partners who have never worked together before and that will bring a dynamism to our work.Results/ImpactUp to 41 staff will undertake the training courses. We aim for a minimum of 5320 indirect participants through use of our directories, training cascaded by partners and through the use of partner websites.Long Term BenefitsThe lack of training for professional staff on the identification of, and support to, More Able students particularly in teacher training and other professions will have been addressed through our courses.The need for detailed manuals to support school staff and others in identification and successful interventions will have been addressed both through the manuals we develop and the training we will deliver.We cover a wide area of Europe and our work will have pertinence beyond national boundaries. The partnership has committed to maintain the resources beyond the length of the project and to support others to introduce the training to their own settings.", "http://www.titan.org.uk", "TITAN PARTNERSHIP LTD", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024278_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B19"}
