The GIFT project suggests creating meaningful personalization through digital gifting and emotional appropriation: Designs for allowing visitors to create their own museum tours as digital 'mixtapes', and to play with technologies that measure emotional responses to artwork as a playful reappropriation of museum spaces.\n\nWe aim to accommodate the complex ways in which users may confront art and heritage content, and engage users to participate and share experiences that are emotionally poignant and personally profound. Through multidisciplinary, practice-based research we will develop, test and validate two ground-breaking prototypes for digital encounters with cultural heritage. From this process we will develop a framework with theory, tools, design guidelines and best practice recommendations for creating meaningful personalization of hybrid virtual museum experiences.\n\nThe GIFT consortium includes leading artists and researchers with a long history of successful collaborations, who will be working with a panel of 10 lead users from prominent European museums, to develop theoretical and practical advances with great impact for the cultural heritage sector and European society.\n\nBy enabling more engaging hybrid virtual/physical museum experiences, we will contribute to increasing citizens' curiosity and engagement. The hybrid format will also help make both virtual museum experiences as well as physical visits more engaging and attractive, thus contributing to economic growth through ticket sales as well as digital sales. By providing frameworks that help non-technical experts in the heritage sector to build and experiment with meaningful personalization of digital cultural heritage, the project gives the sector tools to build and innovate further.\n\n'", 284344.0, 2130332.0, "GIFT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_205705_937136595"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1DH", "Volunteering for social equality", "Concordia UK ltd", 40778.0, "This year the topic of our project will be \u201cvolunteering for social equality\u201d.

We want to involve new ideas and a widen scope of experience in the association. Coordination and exchange are keywords in this project. The project reflects learning opportunities for the volunteer as well as for us as host organisation.  By hosting a volunteer we bring a long-term international dimension in the organisation.

Ideas about that will be discussed together with the volunteer, in cooperation and in team.The volunteer will mostly work with young people and will be participating in workshops with them, but also get the opportunity to work together with them on projects. So the belgian or international youngsters are getting in touch with the different culture as well and can learn about cultural diversity by experiencing it in artistic or cultural projects.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.\r\nDue to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.\r\nAt a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.\r\nAs this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad. Only if our trainees will be sponsored by the ERASMUS+ programme, we are able to realise our project which is continually carried out and supervised by qualified teachers experienced in this area.\r\nMoreover, this programme constitutes the frame of security, trustworthiness, approval and professional advice and support which is so important to our partners and beneficiaries.\r\nThis year\u2019s project of 8 to 11 weeks will be carried out in companies and institutions based in the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey.

For already three years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.\r\nAll details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries. The teachers draw upon this experience by improving the quality of their training and to provide the entire staff with the newly gained knowledge and competences. \r\nThe participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development. \r\n\r\n1 The students of the triennial course do a combined degree course of AVCE and State-certified Commercial Assistant for Foreign Languages.\r\n2 Dual courses are a combination of theoretical vocational training at school and practical training in a company.", "http://www.loxdale.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003828_5"], ["2LA", "APL in Europe", "Loxdale English Centre/Swedish Folk High School", 88984.0, "For several years, Midsommarkransens gymnasium has cooperated with Loxdale Centre in Brighton, England, as well as Lyc\u00e9e priv\u00e9 chalonnais Saint Charles.

Being one of the first European schools in North Rhine-Westphalia, it has always been aiming at enabling all its students the realization of an internship in other European countries. The educational programme \u201cState-certified Commercial Assistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d had been acting as forerunner and was, thus, able to establish contacts and partnerships with business enterprises and schools in France, Great Britain, Spain, Malta and Cyprus in the past decades which every year provide placements to the applicants. This year, 41 trainees will realize an internship in the countries mentioned above as well as in Poland and Ireland. The internship lasting 8 or 11 weeks, respectively, serves as the practical application of the theoretically acquired knowledge during the vocational training. It takes place in its last year when students already have acquired very good knowledge in foreign languages and MS Office. The participants of the internship project carry out commercial correspondence, translate texts into the German language, create customers\u2019 files, participate in customer acquisition, verify transport documents and carry out tasks of the front or back office in hotels. Five interns of the course of \u201cForeign Language Correspondence Clerks\u201d will realise their 3-weeks-internship in Great Britain  towards the end of their second year of traineeship. For these students there also exists a pool of partner companies which annually take new interns or help them to find a placement in order to apply and broaden their language skills. Moreover, the internships serve to gain new insights into the practical work of an enterprise. As a consequence, the participants support the employees when doing their daily work and \u2013 depending on the respective branch \u2013 carry out tasks like the re-organisation of a clients\u2019 file, the research of information about topics communicated beforehand or the assistance in an event\u2019s organisation. \r\nFurthermore, this year 10 trainees of the vocational courses \u201cIndividual Insurance\u201d, \u201cRetailers\u201d and \u201cPersonnel Service Providers\u201d will do their 3-weeks-internship in European countries, frequently in subsidiaries of their employing company, where they are offered the opportunity to work quite goal-oriented taking into account probable cultural differences. For the first time, two students of the educational programme called \u201cCommercial College\u201d are aiming at a 2-weeks-internship abroad. Within the framework of the college\u2019s strategy of internationalisation, it is planned to establish a pool of partner enterprises, too, in order to offer the possibility of taking part in the internship programme to even more students than those of the courses mentioned above. Without the financial support and the formal framework of the ERASMUS+, students of any of the college\u2019s educational programmes could hardly realise an internship abroad. All participants firstly apply in writing for a scholarship with the respective colleague in charge. \u201cBerufskolleg Suedstadt\u201d has got an EU-Team which is led by a project coordinator. Two other colleagues are responsible for the financial processing and insurance matters. Additionally, in each educational programme there is a colleague who is familiar with its specific circumstances and supervises the trainees. Due to the high number of interns deriving from the \u201cAssistants with Focus on Foreign Languages\u201d, there is a colleague responsible for English-speaking EU-countries, Spain and France each, whereas singular internships in Poland this year and the like are cared for by the project coordinator. Once a general overview of the internship programme has been provided by the project coordinator, the teachers in charge draw a selection of the participants, prepare the internship itself, care for the students during their stay abroad and monitor the follow-up work after their return. This also comprises an intensive maintenance of the contact with partner institutions. Due to the possibility of job-shadowing, the personal mobilities in France, Great Britain and Malta predominantly serve the upgrading and broadening of content aspects, especially in foreign trade, customer communication and development of the vocational education in various European countries. Moreover, language skills are intensified and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 improved. The personal maintenance of the contacts with partnership firms enabled by these mobilities, is a vital factor of the project\u2019s success and must not be underestimated. In order to take part in a personal mobility, the staff applies to the head of the college who - according to the qualification and demand \u2013 decides for the teacher to take part in the project. The results of the personal mobilities are communicated to the staff in team meetings, conferences of members of the same subject or educational programme and the students.", "http://www.loxdale.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004666_14"], ["1DH", "Creating Social Projects in Sweden & UK", "Concordia UK ltd", 16213.0, "In a time where there are many Europe face many social challenges, and where there is a need to activate its citizens, this project idea of \"Creating Social Projects in Sweden & UK\" grew. As young people keep getting excluded in different parts of society, both in decision making processes as well as on the labour market, we identify the need to encourage and provide young people with tools to strive for change. \r\n\r\nWith the youth exchange \"Creating Social Projects in Sweden & UK\"  we aim to address mainly this issue. The objective of the project is to train young people in Sweden and UK in social project management with key elements in planning and implementing a social project, presentation skills and led evaluation to further empower and  encourage the youth even after the event. The training is also arranged in order to foster intercultural understanding between the two young groups and through adding different contexts broaden the understanding of what is meant by social action and how it can take different shapes depending on the context and the issue at hand. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of 20 participants in total. There will be 8 young people + 2 leaders from each country, namely  Sweden and United Kingdom. The young group will be between 16-18 years old and with a mix of social backgrounds and international experience.  The young groups will also be gender balanced and will have been recruited on the basis of inclusion. \r\n\r\nThere will be two main exchanges taking place, one in Sweden and one in the UK. First, there will be one week (5 days+2 travel day) in Sweden in the end of May focusing on the training and workshops in how to run a project. Out of the five project days in Sweden, 3 days will focus on our social project management training 'DRIV', with interactive workshops on each step going from an idea to implementation. The additional 2 days, the participants will do project visits of projects focusing on social action, both inside the PeaceWorks orgnaizations as well as outside, namely within M\u00e5ngkulturellt centrum. After the week in Sweden, both young groups, now divided into 4 project groups will try to run and implement their own project ideas in their own local context for about two months. In the middle of August, one week (also 5 days+ 2 travel days) will be spent in the UK,  presenting and evaluating each project and idea. The young groups will have time to reflect on their steps and critically assess their projects. There will also be an assessment and evaluation of their intercultural exchange and the informal learning process taking place as a result of new encounters and new contexts. \r\n\r\nThe whole project will be based on non-formal education, following the non-formal education main pillars;\r\n- Flexibility, being learner-centred, contextualised and based on the promotion of participatory approaches;\r\n- Horizontal cooperation, where facilitators and experts create a shared learning path with participants and trainees, encouraging the exchange of knowledge;\r\n- Personal empowerment though self-esteem raising, development of the self-confidence, competences and skills development.\r\n- This methodology will also permit to deal with the thematic in plenary with due regard to personal approaches and situations.\r\n\r\nThe project result will hopefully provide the participants with a greater sense of empowerment, a will to change and a feeling of being an active part of a community, be it locally, regionally or globally. The project will also have fostered meaningful relationships across Europe and strengthened the bond between young people within the European Union. As for the future, the collaborations and networking of this project will have been maintained for continuing fruitful cooperation - both for the young participants as well as for the partner organizations. The expected impact on the target group is also that they feel inspired to engage in social issues and well-informed to know the ways to do so.", "http://www.concordiavolunteers.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE02-KA105-002037_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BN41"}
