The overall objectives are: the development and implementation of new, reliable, cost-effective technologies, tools and methods for sustainable water supply, use and discharge in the main water consuming industries in order to  significantly reduce water use, mitigate environmental impact and produce and apply water qualities in accordance with industrial own specifications (fit - for - use) from all possible sources, and contributing to a far-going closure of the water cycle in a economical, sustainable and safe way while improving their product quality and process stability. The 4 pillars of the project are Industrial Water Fit-for-use, Integrated water resource management, Strong industrial participation and Cross-sectorial technologies and approach. Water fit-for-use is the basis for sustainable water use; the integrated approach a must. Tools will be developed to define and control water quality. The heart of AquaFit4Use however is the development of new cross-sectorial technologies, with a focus at biofouling and scaling prevention, the treatment of saline streams, disinfection and the removal of specific substances. By intensive co-operation between the industries, the knowledge and the technologies developed in this project will be broadly transferred and implemented. This AquaFit4Use project is based on the work of the Working group 'Water in Industry' of the EU Water Platform WSSTP; 40 % of the project partners of AquaFit4Use were involved in this working group. The expected impacts of AquaFit4Use are: A substantial reduction of fresh water needs (20 to 60%) and effluent discharge of industries; Integrating process technologies for further closing the water cycles; Improved process stability and product quality in the different sectors and strengthening the competitiveness of the European Water Industry.'", 74952.0, 12489910.0, "AQUAFIT4USE", "Sustainable water supply 'fit-for-use'", "Water is a high-value resource and industrial consumption amounting to several billion cubic metres a year has significantly impacted available water supplies. An EU-funded project has developed innovative solutions for the sustainable use of water in sectors that use this precious resource intensively.", "The AQUAFIT4USE project researched technical developments for applications in four high water-consumption sectors: chemical, paper, textile and food. The project developed and tested reliable cost-effective technologies, tools and methods that have reduced freshwater needs.\n\nDeliverables are numerous and span the whole range of water treatment methods. However, the prevailing and significant theme is that they have been developed in accordance with the specifications of individual processes and applications in industry \u2014 'water fit-for-use'.\n\nAn intuitive water quality management (WQM) tool for industrial water management (WESTforINDUSTRY) was developed by teaming up the project's WQM methodology with newly developed software. WESTforINDUSTRY defines, simulates and optimises industrial water networks. Choice of treatment technology and place of use is up to the user. Special software then calculates the effect of each scenario and results are based on comparison and evaluation of different criteria (e.g. costs, freshwater use and discharge).\n\nTo tackle biofouling, the team developed Denutritor, a biofiltration prevention technology. The system was successfully tested on the wastewater treatment effluent of a chemical plant where the biofouling potential was reduced eight-fold. The water could then be reused for industrial applications such as cooling. At an ice cream factory, Denutritor reduced coliform bacteria in collected rainwater; the viable bacteria can then be further reduced with up to 99\u00a0% efficiency on exposure to ultraviolet light. The treated water can be used for cleaning of packing and transport materials (containers, pallets, etc.) and for sanitation (toilets) at the plant location.\n\nA capacitive deionisation (CapDI) system to remove salts from saline streams based on unit modules is now in production. Carbon-coated electrodes show excellent salt removal capacity compared to good quality commercial electrodes. The use of constant current operation enables energy reuse, and in practical conditions 40\u00a0% of energy can be saved. A full-scale system has been tested on cooling towers at two different sites.\n\nDevelopment of reliable cost-effective systems for water treatment on the basis of water fit-for-use has resulted in a reduction of freshwater needs in key industrial sectors. Project outcomes have thus supported EU policy on competitiveness, resource efficiency and the environment.", null, "http://www.alprosoya.com", "/docs/results/images/2012-12/57676.jpg", "fp7_88881_998880684"], ["6NL", "Wind Turbine Shearography Robotic Inspection On-blade System (SheaRIOS)", "Renewable Technical Services Limited", "SheaRIOS is a solution for the Wind Turbine Blade (WTB) inspection industry that enables easier, faster and more accurate inspection utilising robotics and shearography, a high-quality method that is applied outside of the laboratory for the first time. A deployment platform will ascend on the wind turbine tower and deploy a work climber on the base of the blade. The climber will move on the blade by means of air-suction and carry out inspection with a shearography kit on a cantilever. The deployment platform will also act as the power and data link.\n\nOperational modeling is done by EDF, the end-users that drive this Innovation Action. Preliminary testing and validation of the market-readiness of SheaRIOS robotic application will take place at their site, both on-shore (EDF R&D) and off-shore (EDF Renewables). Three competitive small and mid-scale technology companies from three European countries will contribute so Europe will (1) integrate more wind power, (2) reduce operational costs, (3) keep the technology lead, and (4) remain a major export. As per Wind Europe, these are the targets for enabling wind to become the backbone of our electricity generation system.\n\nBased on our analysis, the non-destructive testing service provider would save 1,055\u20ac per wind turbine inspection and payback of SheaRIOS investment will be achieved after 152 inspections, or the first 2 years. The wind farm operator will save more than 1 full day per wind turbine inspection, because of the reduced inspection time, which directly translates to less revenue lost due to idle wind turbines. Finally, the cumulative savings for a period of the first 5 years will translate to \u20ac92.74m, assuming SheaRIOS will be successful in averting just 20% of the unforeseen WTB failures and contributing to increased health and safety for the rope access workers that are involved in hundreds of accidents each year.\n\n[1] Wind Europe, \u201cMaking transition work\u201d, September 2016", 414603.0, 2960655.0, "SheaRIOS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213155_912188971"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7RP", "Continuing Professional Development for Hall Meadow Primary School", "Hall Meadow Primary School", 9833.0, "This project is intended to inform the practice of teaching and learning to secure the best possible outcomes for children, particularly those identified as vulnerable.

Many of our children had parents and grand parents that have all been through the school.  A very large proportion of pupils are of White British heritage. The proportion of pupils from minority ethnic backgrounds is below average. Very few have English as an additional language.
