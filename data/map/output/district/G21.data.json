The name of the project refers not only to crossing international borders but also to experimenting and learning about different music genres, from classical music to pop-rock music and local and national specialities, even to  music technology and composing.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStudent Mobility Activity consists of three week study periods, that include personal tuition in one\u2019s own major subject (musical instrument), on-the-job-learning in orchestra, ensemble or band activities and one or more public performances, either as a member of the aforementioned formations and/or as a soloist. The students also have opportunities to experiment new music genres and instruments, depending on the specialities offered in each of the different host schools. Those students who choose to visit Glasgow Kelvin College will be offered, instead of personal instrumental lessons, tuition in music technology and marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff Mobility Activity consist of one 7-day seminar (travel days included). The principals for this activity were mutually agreed upon in a network meeting in Madrid, in October 2013. The key issues for the week\u2019s program will include learning about curricula, teaching methodologies and evaluation criteria in the networking schools and their home countries. Learning about ECVET and how to apply it in our networking schools and mutual projects will be one of the major topics. Key note speakers will lead the participants to the different discussions. Each seminar guest will have an active role in the program, e.g. they can take turns as the key note speaker. Opportunities for job-shadowing and performing in a concert will be offered to all participants as well. The detailed program for this mobility activity will be drawn up in a network meeting to be held in Warsaw in October or November 2014. That is also the time to decide about the host institution.  \r\n\r\nAs each networking school will send 1 to 2 staff members to this seminar, it is expected to have 10 \u2013 18  participants. They can represent teaching and administration staff alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Finland, MWF has a national network of three conservatories. Administered by Lahti Conservatory, the other two partners are  Helsinki and Joensuu Conservatories. These three schools have in total some 190 students in vocational training and intend to send 30 students to Music without Frontiers exchange during the two year project term.  We are applying to send 6 representatives to the seminar. Our partner schools locate in Spain, Scotland, Poland, Portugal, Estonia and the Czech Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the impacts of the project we wish to provide all participants personal growth in their professional skills and also as independent citizens to interact with people from other countries, whether within EU or outside its borders. For our organizations we expect to maintain our good relations and to further develop our  international networking abilities. Thereto, as long term benefits, we wish to gain strong potential to further develop our teaching and evaluation methods. We sincerely hope that MWF Staff Seminar will facilitate the introduction of ECVET in all involved countries. More longterm benefits of Music without Frontiers  Project will be discovered in the future when we can find an increasing number of  foreign musicians playing or teaching in different institutions around Europe and welcoming  visitors to their own institutions with warm hospitality.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FI01-KA102-000090_5"], ["4TD", "Music Without Frontiers/Fashioning the Future", "Glasgow Kelvin College", 74694.0, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThis project is carefully planned mobility programme for 24 music students, 16 fashion students and 8 members of staff at Glasgow Kelvin College.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nStudents will participate in a work placement abroad.  The project will provide music students from the various colleges with an opportunity to work in partnership to learn skills in specific musical styles and organise and perform at concerts in the respective schools.  This will assist students to develop a number of skills in relation to music, partnership working, team work and event management.  The project will therefore provide valuable additional employability related skills gained in an international context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will encourage fashion students to explore the cultural inspiration from the partner schools and use this as a source of design inspiration and development.  It will culminate in the design, production and presentation of fashion goods at various fashion shows which will take place in each of the partner colleges.  This is linked to industry practices where a design team is given a brief from a client to interpret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion staff will take part in a variety of teaching and learning related activities over a period of seven days to extend and develop their professional practice.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMusic student mobility\r\n\r\nTo develop professional abilities\r\n\r\nTo develop an understanding of other cultures and also the business and work environment in other countries.\r\n\r\nTo develop on the job learning opportunities, skills and experience\r\n\r\nTo develop professional competences in their chosen music subject area and learn new skills in relation to other musical styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion student mobility\r\n\r\nTo develop cultural awareness by exploring the cultural influences of the partner city school.\r\n\r\nTo develop a common design brief, interpret design ideas, develop patterns and produce garments and accessories.\r\n\r\nTo develop new production and technical skills to create garments and accessories.\r\n\r\nTo market the Fashion Show and exhibition using new technologies \r\n\r\nTo explore new ways of marketing the project outcome\r\n\r\nTo present the fashion goods at a fashion show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFashion student mobility\r\n\r\nTo develop new vocational production and technical skills to address the technical challenges identified \r\n\r\nDevelop innovative approaches to sustainability of resources within manufacturing \r\n\r\nDevelop personal continuing professional development\r\n\r\nTo learn how to use additional industry software packages\r\n\r\nTo develop partnership working in an international setting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes are:\r\n\r\nStudents will be able gain vocationally based outcomes, develop social, employability and language skills. \r\n\r\nStaff members who have developed additional skills within their subject expertise\r\n\r\nStaff will develop new teaching methods developed as a result of \u201csharing of good practice\u201d\r\n\r\nDevelopment of partnership working in an international setting\r\n\r\nImproved understanding of educational systems and qualification frameworks within another European country.\r\n\r\nPositive exchange of information and work methods\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONG TERM BENEFITS\r\n\r\nThe project will provide participants to gain experience in the music industry in a different cultural setting, with different cultural norms and procedures.

Our inner city area of Glasgow is one of the most deprived areas of the United Kingdom and young people have few opportunities to get out of the city, let alone experience spending quality time with young people from other countries, learning about other cultures and seeing what is best about other places and lifestyles. RYA is a forward looking, ambitious organisation who has a real passion for doing the best it can for these young people.  \r\nDuring the summer of 2015 we sent our first group of young people to go on an international youth exchange to Austria and the benefits gained by the young people and our organisation have been numerous and impressive. The step up to hosting an international youth exchange is a natural progression and links to our organisational planning following attendance on numerous \"fact finding\" Youth in Action and Erasmus Plus programmes. The objectives of the project are; to offer a chance to young people with fewer opportunities aged 13 - 15 years from a diverse group of EU countries to come together to form new friendships; to learn about different peoples and cultures; to understand the benefits of healthy lifestyle, sport and exercise; to understand the part the EU plays in their lives and what part they may play in the future of the EU; to plan ahead to continue and improve upon the initial exchange experience and to grow the bonds between the respective organisations. These objectives link to those of the Erasmus + programme and specifically KA1 Youth Mobility by concentrating on young people with fewer opportunities highlighting social inclusion, by promoting active European citizenship through volunteering in particular, by embedding intercultural dialogue throughout the whole process and by \"internationalising\" an organisation that can only benefit and go from strength to strength as well as supporting priorities around healthy behaviours and healthy lifestyle.The exchange will be for 50 young people supported by 15 group leaders and support staff.  A lack of opportunities in general is the biggest problem facing the young people we and our partners work with, and becoming more international is part of the solution, so we are giving young people an opportunity to understand this and a motivation to start a \"European journey\" in their lives. The activity programme will be kept simple in order for the participants to get the maximum feeling of achievement and benefit from the exchange. The main elements of the activity are:\r\n1. Welcome, introductions and icebreakers, to allow participants to relax and get to know each other.\r\n2. Team and confidence building through various outdoor problem solving exercises\r\n3. A Glasgow City Challenge to take the team and confidence building process further as well as giving the chance to discover Glasgow\r\n4. Information session on Erasmus+ and Youthpass. Practice of Youthpass\r\n5. Information session and discussion on healthy living and lifestyle\r\n6. Various outdoor activity sessions to enjoy exercise and appreciate the natural environment \r\n7. Interactive discussions / presentations and quiz on \"my Home, my Europe\" (youth issues and similarities especially in the context of Europe, and my place in Europe)\r\n8. Sport and problem solving challenges to encourage interaction and dialogue\r\n9. Intercultural and social evenings\r\n10. Daily learning review and Youthpass sessions\r\n11. Forward planning for future events\r\n12. Final evaluation and Youthpass session\r\n\r\nThe methodology will be interactive which means that participants will have an active role in all sessions. They will work together mainly in mixed teams to enhance the opportunity for intercultural learning. All activities  require team work and co-operation between participants, both in national groups and mixed groups. Participants will be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning outcomes through the exchange. By the end of the exchange, they will have developed a sense of shared European identity, a respect for cultural differences and an understanding of healthy lifestyle and living. The project will give participants a greater self confidence and belief in what they are able to achieve. It will expose them to possibilities of a life beyond their current circumstances. It will raise aspiration and encourage possibilities of more healthy living,through non formal education methods. It will increase understanding of the European project and their place within it.

The pupils are studying administrative management and have a European option to assess for their exam. They are preparing a BTEC first in Jean Baptiste Brochier vocational high school.\r\nWe already have partners companies in Glasgow through a partnership with Glasgow city council, Glasgow Kelvin College and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association.\r\nWe need to fulfill the following goals :\r\n- to improve the current and professional English vocabulary,\r\n- to develop the pupils' autonomy and responsibilities,\r\n- to awaken them to another  European culture,\r\n- to help them develop their self-confidence and their self-esteem,\r\n- to acquire a better cultural and professional mind,\r\n- to favour higher education in which the knowledge of the English language is essential,\r\n- to make them become  more effective European citizens,\r\n- and finally,to make them contemplate a professional future in a European country.\r\nThe participants are preparing a BTEC first in administrative management with a European option. To pass their Euro option they have to be assessed orally by 2 teachers : an English teacher and a management teacher. They need to be able to develop a professional activity in English and obtain a minimum of 10/20. \r\nMoreover, they have an English exam too, as every other pupils preparing a BTEC first, but, they must have 12/20 to validate the Euro option. So, they really need to improve their English level as much as possible. The European option will be a great value on their diploma to help them being accepted in higher education courses and to find a job.\r\nOur pupils will be registered to the 'mobility unit option'. It is a new option created in 2015 by the French eduction board to give more importance to the pupils' placements abroad. It gives them the opportunity to have their placement assessment appearing on their diplomas as a positive mark. It is assessed through an oral exam in French relating their experience abroad on a professional and cultural point of view. At the same time they will take a EUROPRO exam in English.\r\nThe preparatory activities for this placement period will try to achieve the goals below : \r\n- cultural knowledge of the country,\r\n- social-economic aspects of the professional world of the country,\r\n-improvement in the current and professional vocabulary.\r\nFor the school year 2016-2017, we asked for an English speaking language assistant to our regional fund to help us achieve our linguistic and cultural goals. We succeeded in having this person. We asked for the same fund for next year.\r\nMany people from our school are part of this project and work in collaboration, both on the administrative and teaching sides (head of school and depute, financial manager, nurse, teachers). Pupils' parents and tutors from the companies are also part of the project.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory activities :\r\nSince their first year in this schedule, our pupils have more hours in English to get ready for this project and to succeed in obtaining their Euro option. They are also trained in the management course through oral communication linked to their professional field (oral presentation and role plays in English\u2026). English is a compulsory subject for every pupil preparing a BTEC first. And the exam is an oral presentation about a topic chosen by the pupil. They need to train, so the placement will be a perfect training, plus a perfect topic to talk about.\r\nOn a cultural and linguistic side, the pupils participated in the European langages day last October. During this day, they experienced many activities about the European history and culture as well as using the European languages.\r\nTo make our pupils aware about the European citizenship we have a partnership with 'La Maison de l'Europe', an association promoting Europe through different means. We choose to have our pupils participate in their European citizenship challenge. For their tenth edition, one pupil from the Euro section ranked second  this year and made us very proud of her. Every year we have some pupils from the Euro section being on one of the three first ranks.\r\nOur expectations for the future :\r\nWe hope to motivate pupils to integrate our European section in the future years. Indeed, it is still new and pupils don't really know what it is. It stays too abstract for them. \r\nIf our current pupils can go on a work placement abroad, they could talk about it to the future pupils wishing to study administrative management and promote the European section when they participate in different students or professional fairs, or at our school when we organize our open day event.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036897_1"], ["2BS", "LARP - Fantasy and adventure in Swedish nature #3", "Royston Youth Action", 49896.0, "H\u00e4stekasen Farm Association is in the process to found a self sustainable eco-community and learning centre.

(56 participants) (8 countries) (12 days)\r\n\r\nThese activities will merge into and support each other.\r\n\r\nWe have become more convinced about the strength in Edu-Larp (fantasy, acting, storytelling) as an non-formal learning method. How it affects: team building, motivation, intercultural understanding and personal development. We created a lot of self confidence and strong emotions in previous YE.\r\nThis project has also proven to strengthen and widen our network quite radically, it has an impact and more and more people want to hear about it. It has also proven to have a local impact. We have made many new contacts due to this project. Also this project has a budget that is mainly spent locally and thus empowering the countryside and what we call \"ruralisation\".\r\n\r\nLarp means, \"live action role playing game\", in this case we create a fantasy \"Lord of the rings world\". This will be prepared in workshops such as:  Acting, Scout skills, Safety, Sewing, Building shelters, Rythm and music, Mythology of the world,  Simple handicraft, Moving in nature, Reflection time.\r\n\r\nThe Short EVS will arrive earlier preparing for the Youth exchange focusing on practical building and nature/camping skills.\r\nThe Job Shadow will be part of the whole project (arriving before the main activities) focusing on studying/evaluating quality management, and also working on possible future projects.\r\n\r\nWe will according to the Nordic larp tradition focus on inclusion. A tradition of \"seeing\" each other, reacting to each others initiatives within the game. An attitude that can spread into our social interactions also outside the acting part of the activities.\r\n\r\nEvery activity  will be linked to many of the key competences through the youth pass. One added competence to be explored is imagination. Not as a passive consumer of pop-culture, but as co-creator in a group. Bringing shared experience of historical events and fictional characters into real life. After the workshops the participants are both actors and audience in a spectacle that goes on for days - day and night. An adventure in Swedish nature in a fantasy world based on Viking fairy tales.  Imagination is a skill that can be trained and that is not only linked to entertainment or culture - it is a part of creative abstract scientific thinking.\r\n\r\nWe are very excited about this project. There is an unknown factor we look forward to explore together with the youth. This is about creating a \"social game\" based on imagination where \"anything can happen\". The soft factors are: nature, weather and the participants personalities. \r\n\r\nWe believe youth need to be adventurous, even to the border of chaos. It is our role as adults to create safe venues for youth to be able to release energy and lust.  As youth leaders we need to explore new attracting ways of channeling hyperactivity, depression, frustration and teenage hormones - into something constructive  and positive.\r\n\r\nThe social skills that we want to explore is:\r\n- Self awareness.\r\n- Functioning in a multi cultural group.\r\n- Methods of decision making (discussion and votes).\r\n- Methods of learning, practical as well as social methods.\r\n- Leadership skills.\r\n- Storytelling, writing and verbal skills.\r\n\r\nWe would like to stress the activities concept of inclusion beyond language. Youth of the world share this imaginary world of fantasy (mostly known for \"The lord of the rings\"). Sharing interest and using imagination to create a world together is very powerful. The level of non formal learning will be high. On the surface we are playing a social game, where the participants together control the outcome - while we are developing the skills mentioned above.\r\nSo we will mix many groups, many cultures, many ages, many nationalities, many languages and with the power of imagination we will unify them in a fairy tale tale adventure in Swedish nature. \r\n\r\nWe would like to develop the concept to its full potential and this time spend more focus on the participants \"ownership\" of the activities and on dissemination.\r\n\r\nSince we joined the Erasmus program in 2012, our association have tried to challenge ourselves by choosing new approaches to our main theme - using natures resources in a sustainable way.", "http://www.roystonyouthaction.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-3-SE02-KA105-001957_9"], ["2HL", "Equal Love", "Toonspeak Young People's Theatre", 28644.0, "This project is an international youth exchange of 8 international partners from Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Poland, Ireland, UK, Austria and Germany.

In 2016 the number of dropouts in Aix-Marseille Academy ranked second in France and the number of people with \u201cvulnerabilities in economic, family and cultural terms\u201d is the highest in France - 45% of the population. Within the age group of 15-24 years old the Academy has a dropout rate of 28.8% in comparison to 25.4% for France. (CEREQ)\r\nWithin this dropout rate, the highest number comes from vocational high schools. An effective way to limit early school leaving and contribute to the Erasmus + 2020 objectives is to create a dynamic environment in vocational high schools. This will allow students from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds, often coming from migrant families or rural areas with fewer mobility opportunities to do their work experience in a European country.\r\nDue to the severity of the issue as described above, along with our previous successes, we the steering committee (DAREIC, GIP FCIP and the PACA Region) wish to support 42 vocational high schools in the implementation of work experiences in Europe for 902 less privileged students studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel during a 24 month period (689 Erasmus mobility grants and 213 Region co financing).\r\nThe main objective is to give them the opportunity to live an experience that will be an essential added value for their socio-professional integration. In practical terms, reinforced assistance will be offered by using specialized structures in supporting the mobility of young people having fewer opportunities through non-formal educational methods. We will work with the Eurocircle association.\r\nWhen they return to France, the participants of the project will pass on their experience, enhancing the project within the school.  They will thus act as spokesmen for European mobility, inspiring the desire and motivation to their peers. Pupils will use European certificates (Europass CV) and will receive a Europass Mobility and Mobility credits.\r\nGIP FCIP, the project initiator, will facilitate administrative and financial procedures in partnership with the schools financial management services. The DAREIC will coordinate the preparation, mentoring, implementation and enhancement of mobility activities of each school working together with the PACA Region. The consortium members will put into effect various activities and will be a source of inspiration via a mentoring scheme and the establishment of a collaborative platform named M@gist\u00e8re.\r\nExperiences and skills gained by expert teams will help mentor new educational teams. This project will facilitate the sharing of knowledge, good practice and collaboration with the aim of improving the quality of international mobility across the consortium partners.\r\nThe DAREIC would also like to create a network of local businesses that would improve the quality of the work placements. The local businesses would work with us to identify businesses in Europe thanks to their subsidiaries or customers. The Region is a stakeholder in the creation of this network with a progressive involvement over the long term. \r\nThe objective of this project is to provide these young people with the opportunity to experiment mobility in order to widen their future employment horizons. This could be achieved through the dissemination of information, personalized pre-departure coaching and by making the most of the experience gained thus creating the conditions for success within schools.\r\nGIP-FCIP, DAREIC and Region will work as a steering committee that will evaluate and measure the impact of the project, in order to develop a strategy to improve practices as well as the quality of mobility and capitalize on acquired experiences. \r\nThe impacts of this project are numerous.

Salpaus\u2019 strategic development programs for 2020 are designed to strengthen partnerships and networks with working life, implement changes in pedagogy and learning solutions, as well as created a solid economic foundation. As part of this strategy process is to define, a united operating culture.\r\n\r\nThe aim of Salpaus is to build a community-based culture. Salpaus is to develop organizational culture within the following areas: participation of students, strengthening of co-operation between education and professional groups, and strengthening communication between of leadership and work. Strategic development programs and areas for growth within the organizational culture are drawn up annually; these also guide the planning and implementation of Salpaus' international activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Salpaus Further Education was awarded the Erasmus+ Mobility Charter for Vocational Training (VET Mobility Charter). Based on the feedback from this accreditation and the Strategic Programs of Salpaus, the following priorities for the development of international operations have been selected: student participation, The standardization of international activities of different education fields and sectors and co-operation between the contact teachers, home-based internationalization, as well as in Spring 2018 planning an international part degree program for individual study paths.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the internal communication and marketing of Salpaus, our aim is to share international experiences with the use of social media. The goal is for the students to become the content creators of \"internationalsalpaus\" -Instagram and Facebook's \"Salpaus international participants\" accounts. The aim is to bring international experiences closer to all students and staff representatives. We have been striving for clearer and more open communication and it is still the goal. An active team has been gathered from eager students to develop more student oriented international activities.\r\n\r\nThe Salpaus Further Education is an international educational institution with ongoing internal and working life related development of international relationships. All our study fields have equal opportunities for studies and on-the-job learning abroad. Salpaus is developing international activities continuously. Development is increasingly focusing on student orientation which is one of our strategic goals. Involvement of students in the development of international affairs, together with the Salpaus staff, will be incorporated into our activities. Salpaus invest in home-based internationalization, for example, students are actively involved in presenting our organization to foreign guests. Through home-based internationalization, we also develop the skills of students who do not wish to be involved in an international study path or do not travel abroad.\r\n\r\nMonthly meetings with the contact teachers include the development, marketing and inspiration of students towards international activities. This activity is supported by planning meetings with different education managers in the various study fields. The regular group meetings of the contact teachers also support their networking and the sharing of good practice in different professional disciplines.\r\n\r\nInternational mobility at Salpaus is at a good level. The student mobility periods are mainly one or two months. Last year, 115 students completed a mobility period abroad most of which ranged from 2 to 15 weeks in either an on-the-job learning situation or in a study institute. The most popular target countries have been Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and other European countries. In addition, periods of study have been carried out in Asia and elsewhere outside Europe with project funding or by the institution's own funding. Numerous international projects are currently in progress within Salpaus, these are developing, among others, new areas of expertise and international learning environments. Students and staff also participate in international projects seminars and events abroad. \r\n\r\nStaff mobility has been well achieved. We have established good partnerships with foreign institutes, which gives us more opportunities to develop international know-how both for students and staff. Co-operation with international partners is close and coordinated, together it is agreed in advance the number of international exchanges, their duration, dates, activities and goals. Foreign exchange students and staff arriving to our institute have the opportunity to share their internationalize know-how within our institution.\r\n\r\nInternational mobility is expected to grow slightly as the development of international activity is more systematic and preparation for this has been done within the study fields, which aim to have increased students' international interest.", "http://www.glasgowkelvin.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046746_1"], ["2BS", "Raising attainment using SOLE in mathematics for 11-12 year old learners", "Saint Roch's Primary School", 139730.0, "This project addresses the development of key competences in pupils and teachers in the teaching and learning of mathematics for pupils aged 11-12 years in Glasgow, Warsaw and Valencia in order primarily to raise attainment.

At the same time we have to acknowledge that the group of migrants currently entering the European Union as asylum seekers are a very diverse group concerning their education and qualification background. OECD studies show that about 40% of Syrian asylum seekers own a kind of upper secondary degree whereas the Afghan asylum seekers only 12-15% have this kind of qualification. Moreover, and this is certainly different to all experiences from the past, migrants are coming from totally different education systems, labour market conditions, work conditions etc. which are nearly impossible to compare with European standards. In front of this situation it is nearly impossible to simply recognise a certificate or diploma (if available at all), this would unfortunately be the easy and positive exemption. This developments and situation lead to two quite dangerous reaction for the European VET systems and labour markets: a) solutions are built on national level without taking into account European standards and instruments (like EQF and ECVET for recognition)b) approaches are diversified between several organisations (one responsible for recognition, one for training plan, one for guidance, one for labour market insertion, one for work placements etc.) Both trends need to be avoided and lead to the immediate need for a labour market integration model for refugees AND asylum seekers with a positive acceptance perspective which is: - based on European approaches and instruments in competence based VET (ECVET and EQF / NQF)- holistic, combining recognition of prior formal/non-formal/informal learning with language assessment, social assessment and elaboration of an individual, personalised inclusion plan for each person - easy to manage for authorities and carriers- efficient in terms of resources needed and outcome achieved - oriented towards professions and labour market sectors with clear labour demand - accessible for all and oriented towards the principles of equal opportunities.The main objective of the NCNA project is to develop an innovative and target group oriented model for the assessment, validation and recognition of prior experiences and informal learning of refugees and asylum seekers with positive perspective to stay, based on learning outcomes approach and using instruments, credits and descriptors from EQF and above all ECVET.

Besides the humanitary aid ( need for food, housing and basic goods for refugees and migrant families and young people) , it is urgent to react in providing with basic skills and the first elements to a smooth integration in their EU receiving countries.Experience has shown in recent years that massive migration and refugees exodus has a big impact in receiving countries, leading to difficult integration and undesired side effects such as xenophobia from local population.  Xenophobia, social exclusion, discrimination and discontent with sudden awakening from the \u201cEuropean dream\u201d can cause marginalization and radicalization of migrants and their families with subsequent undesired side effects such as the terrorists attacks in Paris and recently in Brussels.The Paris declaration, adopted at the Informal Meeting of the EU Education Ministers in Paris on 17 March 2015, gave the strong signal that, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, Ministers wanted to boost EU-level cooperation in the acquisition of social, civic and intercultural competences, by promoting fundamental rights, social inclusion and non-discrimination, intercultural dialogue in all forms of learning. Promoting citizenship and the common values of freedom, tolerance and non-discrimination through education is one of EU priorities nowaday at ET2020. Many NGOs have a great deal of expertise in addressing these issues by providing non-formal education where the government lacks the capacity to do so, and are the relevant stakeholder that can be key to swiftly impact on refugees and migrants target groups for a better integration. Spain  and Italy are EU countries with EU external border with a long experience in facing massive legal and irregular migration from non EU and developing countries. How many in these flows are irregular labour migrants and how many are refugees? It is difficult to know. Refugee crisis has expanded the number of countries facing a really demanding challenge of receiving a big number of refugees and other migrants such as Germany and  UK.  Many best practices from the non formal and basic adult education provided by NGOs, charity organizations and social services at local governments are developed in different countries, but they are disperse and non complete, providing with some training directed towards migrant and refugees target groups, while there is not a well structured teachers or educators training or train the trainers in this field. In this sense, a transnational EU project  bring together all the expertise and innovation from Italy, Spain, Germany and UK, that has been developed in formal and non formal education contexts, developing  handbook with teaching techniques and training materials for teachers of adult migrants and refugees. This is where European added value can put together all the different and disperse best practices in Europe for the benefit of educators, teachers and trainers in  adult training and other relevant organizations over all Europe: NGOs, social services at local administration, charity organizations.The products will be produced under the development of 2 Intellectual Outputs: IO1 and IO 2, adressed to trainers and educators and to migrants and refugees respectively.1) Acting on Adult training professionals in formal and non formal training and professionals acting in an informal training of migrants and refugees. Providing the right skills, training techniques, and making training resources available.The handbook for educators will contain teaching techniques useful in more formal and non formal situations, as well as techniques to be used in more informal contexts. The whole set of techniques must follow the principles of respect, inclusion and mutual tolerance.2) Acting on refugees and migrants themselves. Providing knowledge and resources for a better understanding of life and values in Europe and in receiving country. This will make their new life in the new country easier, more pleasant, more inclusive and with a better access to labour market.Project downloadable training materials for adult educators and for migrant and refugees learners will be free accessible form project website in easy and ready to use Pdf files. Pdfs will be available in English, German, Italian, Spanish and Catalan.At least 100 adult educators and relevant stakeholders will take part in face to face project activities. It is expected that at least 600 people can take part in the project  in different ways.Accelerating the process of a better understanding of refugees and migrants of receiving countries culture, European citizenship rights and duties and European culture at workplace, will have a very positive impact on refugees and migrants with a better understanding and integration, enhancing their comfort and possibilities of a new working and prosperous life at receiving country.", "http://www.bridgesprogrammes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA204-025052_2"], ["4BF", "Hate speech disarmament \u2013 Equipping youth workers to manage and transform hate speech", "Interfaith Scotland", 246475.0, "In Europe youth workers need methods, tools, procedures and guidelines to deal with hate speech and to manage and solve conflicts in sustainable way in their work.  In particular they are looking concrete tools for working with youth that use hateful language in youth spaces and concrete methods for hate speech transformation with youngsters with extremist attitudes. The objective of this project is to collect existing best practices and develop concrete means and tools to tackle hate speech in youth work. The project will increase awareness, information and know-how about hate speech and related phenomena. The project will develop and share concrete means and measures to tackle hate speech in youth work, and build the capacity of youth workers  to implement anti hate speech actions in their work. Through the transformative approach to tackling hate speech, the project promotes constructive participation in the society. This means that engagement with (rather than exclusion of) young people producing hate speech helps to avoid their becoming radicalized or joining extremist groups or gangs. If all relevant youth work organisations in our countries embark on the journey of hate speech transformation then these young people will benefit immensely as they will get the structured space where their manner of expression will be challenged, they will be challenged to reflect their positions, but at the same time they will not be excluded from youth work activities and they will get the chance to develop themselves into reflected and respectful human beings, even accepting diversity and ambiguity. That will also have positive impact for society as less youth with extremist opinions and behaviour means heathier and safer society for all.  \r\n\r\nThe innovation of this project lies in the diversity of the partnership and the specific expertise each partner brings to the table through their participants. During the project we will train 25 youth workers, who identify themselves as belonging to marginalised or minority group,  to become specialised trainers in hate speech transformation - expertise really lacking in the national contexts of the participating organisations based on experience and needs analysis. Today  in most of the partner countries youth workers  belonging to marginalised and minority groups  are not participating in any of the main established pools of trainers and their opinions and expertise is not heard when looking for solutions for the worsening hate speech phenomenon in our societies.  With the expertise from the field and the one of partner organisations we will create an interactive Tool Kit for Hate Speech Transformation to be used by youth workers, trainers and educators working with groups of young people. The Tool Kit is a collection of methodologies to be used in any group when hate speech occurs or when participants use discriminatory speech in their interactions with others and within the group. We will also create an Interactive Online Learning Platform which will serve as a complementary mechanism for the Tool Kit and will be an independent learning space and tool on the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe partners of the project comes from Finland, Portugal, Ireland, Slovenia and Scotland;  each bringing different working knowledge and experiences which include youth policy, LQBTQ, Religious interfaith, disability, peace education, professional training of youth workers, anti racism and discrimination. All partners work directly with youth and minority or marginalised groups. Having such diverse partners  enables an innovative approach to  addressing hate speech, from reaching the profiled participants from minority groups to, understanding the issue of hate speech and the tools/methods for transforming hate speech and discrimination in a safe and educational way. The project partnerships brings with it a unique approach  to equality and social inclusion, through supporting the exchange and new learning of each other's knowledge and sector experiences. Through this process the project will gather best practices to address and transform hate speech in youth spaces, providing tools for youth workers and the youth field beyond the project.", "http://www.interfaithscotland.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA205-034627_3"], ["4BF", "Competence for Inclusion in International Youth Work", "Interfaith Scotland", 105461.0, "The project will share concrete measures to increase inclusive youth participation, reduce discriminatory attitudes, practices and inequality therefore enable equal and safe participation for all youth within Erasmus + programme.

The project is the creation of five partner organizations and they come from different corners of Europe> Romania, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal and Scotland, being very experienced in working on inclusive youth work, but they all have different approach to it, having different target groups: women, LGBTIQ+ youth, rural and Roma youth, young people with disabilities, young people from minority religious groups. \r\nDuring the project period, five learning activities will be organized as well as three transnational project meetings.\u00a0 All the learning activities will include visits to see local actors work in practice, workshops on sharing good practices and building new approaches for inclusion, project planning, interactive daily reflections and evaluation, learning about 8 key competences and Youthpass (individual and group work, feedback rules, self-reflection) as well as sharing\u00a0 methodologies about how to use Youthpass as an instrument for learning and recognition of non-form for youngsters with different identities and abilities. 125 people will directly be invovled in the international activities of the project and in total 3300 people will be involved in diffeerent parts of the project. \r\n\r\nThe expected results of the project are: \r\n1. Increase of awareness on structural and institutional discriminatory practices within youth work and Erasmus + programme and disseminate knowledge how to overcome them. \r\n2. Increase capacity (skills, knowledge and attitude) of youth workers to improve their practises and work in more inclusive manner. \r\n3. Increase safe participation and engagement of youth from discriminated and/or with unnormative identities in Erasmus + projects.\r\n4. Strengthen the networks of youth work organisations and equality/minority organisations\r\nThe project will involve youth workers from each partner country who have a high level of expertise in involving young people from discriminated groups in local, national and international activities. Through these expert youth workers input the project will gather good practices shared amongst the youth workers participating the learning activities. Each organisation in the partnership has good practices to share. The practices and methods used in partner countries varies from organisation to organisation which will assure the learning outcomes of the project to be useful for every organisation involved and will also ensure diversification of method at the level of each organisation.

His experiment showed that if children are motivated and given the tools they will teach themselves and each other. This project results from discussions following Sugata Mitras video presentation and is to answer the question about how Sugata Mitras methods can be effectively adopted and applied in the mathematics, physics and biology classrooms.              Objectives: Sugata Mitras method of \"teaching\" is a significant move away from traditional classroom teaching. It asks the students to \"teach\" themselves. The ambition of this project is for teachers of Maths, Physics and Biology in the three schools involved to end up teaching as, or as close as possible to, the way Sugata Mitra envisaged in his Ted Talk and for these teaching methods to spread out from the classrooms in each of the three partner countries.  (A simple example of a child driven lesson would be to show the students a video clip of a Water Tank being filled up with a hose and simply asking how long it will take to fill up.) With this type of teaching the teacher acts as an adviser, coach, director, mentor, motivator.  It is believed that this student driven approach to teaching results in higher engagement of students in their education, resulting in better attainment and more mature and self confident individuals who are better prepared for the world of work and who can make a better contribution to their community and society after school.   Number and profile of participants: Three schools involved. Szkola Da Vinci on Poznan, Poland, Sagrada Familia in El Masnou, Catalonia, and Saint Roch's Secondary in Glasgow, Scotland. Students aged 12-15 will be directly involved. Eleven teachers will be directly involved.    Description of activities: Student activities will take place in the mathematics, physics and biology classrooms of the three schools. twice per year. Once before Christmas and once after Christmas. These activities will be for students to learn topics, which would be part of the curriculum and taught anyway, using the new innovative Sugata Mitra method, with the guidance and coaching of the teachers. As the project develops from activity to activity, over the three years, the  level of competence and sophistication will develop. By the end of the three years teaching in this new method should be integral to the schools and an accepted and normal way of teaching. The milestones of the project are the international student activities that take place in January of each year. In these activities students from the three schools will come together. They will receive team training then hold a  mini conference and workshops, giving presentations and discussing progress and develop their thoughts on how they should move forward.         Methodology use: At the start of the project the teachers of all schools will hold a three day meeting. Day1 will start with team training followed by learning Sugata Mitras methodology, receiving a presentation from a specialist, then discussion groups. Day 2 will be to practice implementing and using the new methodology in the classroom and giving and doing practice lessons. Day 3 will be to choose topics for activities in each subject. to prepare proforma reports, evaluations and lesson plans and for setting up eTwinning and Facebook. The teachers in each subject will be responsible for the content of the new student activities, staying with the Time table and ensuring completion of evaluations, reports and lesson plans. Coordinators will disseminate by inputting to eTwinning and Facebook. At the start of each year the teachers will hold a video conference to ensure everyone is lined up for the year ahead. At the end of each year the coordinators will meet to complete the yearly progress report and plan the next year.            Results/impact envisaged: The impact on all students (including local deprived, international refugee and asylum seekers, and deaf) should be that they leave school better qualified, more rounded and mature learners who will be more effective contributors to society and whose employment prospects will be enhanced. The continual professional development received by the teachers by doing this project should result in them becoming more effective teachers and deliverers, ahead of and leading other teachers in the use of this innovative teaching method.
