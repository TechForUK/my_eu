Recognising that food production and consumption is not only linked via food chains in a physical-logistic way, but above all via value chains in terms of social acceptance, FOODMETRES is designed to combine quantitative and evidence-based research principles with qualitative and discursive methods to address the wider dimensions of food chains around metropolitan agro-systems.\n\nThe main goals are:\n- Identify concepts as well as practical examples for food chain innovation in the context of small-scale urban, peri-urban and peri-urban-rural forms of agriculture and food production up to large-scale metropolitan production regimes geared towards feeding urban populations;\n- Assess the economic, environmental and social impacts of innovative food chain systems from small scale to large scale, making use of the ecological footprint and product life cycle analysis with special emphasis on efficiency, regional competitiveness, cultural identity (landscapes and regional markets) and ecosystem services such as water management, nutrient recycling and biodiversity;\n- Study and compare technical, logistical, organisational and governance aspects of innovative food chain systems in selected case studies to define best practice when engaging regional stakeholders from both business and policy in sustainable food planning at the level of metropolitan regions.\n- Supply scenario modeling and impact assessment tools to all stakeholders in urban-peri-urban areas to assist with planning and decision making.

Through the analysis of current food chains in urbanised areas, the 'Food planning and innovation for sustainable metropolitan regions' (http://www.foodmetres.eu/ (FOODMETRES)) project will create and improve the sustainability of the urban food production chain. This includes not only reducing food metres or the length of food chains, but also increasing recycling and improving the efficiency of production technology.\n\nDuring the first phase of the project, the consortium established a conceptual framework, establishing links between the innovation targets, scenario development and impact assessment. At the innovation workshop in Wageningen, the project-specific concept 'system innovation' was developed, comprised of product, process, social and governance domains. Three spatial\u2013functional layers of agro-food systems, including LAS (local), MAS (metropolitan) and GAS (global) were also specified, and a set of candidate indicators reviewed.\n\nThe team has performed an assessment on MAS areas in terms of supply capacity and the land use areas of metropolitan centres. Furthermore, a Common Operational Data Protocol (CODP) was established for the case study research and a http://data.foodmetres.eu (FOODMETRES data repository) was uploaded on to a MediaFire site.\n\nTwo distinct analytical strands for the assessment of Metropolitan 'foodprint' and sustainability impacts for different chain types were also established and implemented. The first strand involves a generic qualitative benchmarking procedure for sustainability impact assessment making use of food-specific Impact Areas and a newly developed Food Chain Typology. The second strand offers a spatially explicit approach for land-use allocation to match the consumer demands at the regional level. The approach is based on a land zonation concept inspired from the von Th\u00fcnen approach and the Metropolitan Footprint Tool (MFT) allows stakeholders to engage in \u2018serious gaming\u2019 to help improving the regional food supply capacity by means of digital maptable technology.\n\nKnowledge brokerage tools used by stakeholders were reviewed, and a first round of stakeholder workshops has begun in London. Stakeholder sessions with local entrepreneurs were also organised in the Rotterdam region, and the project has been engaging the Greater London Authority (GLA) food planning team. Other case study areas include Ljubljana, Milano, Berlin and Nairobi.

The diseases of particular focus for this project are osteochondrosis  (OC), insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) and chronic progressive lymphedema (CPL). The occurrence of these diseases is a significant problem for horse owners and breeders and leads to poor animal welfare and severe economic losses. The initiative of this project is mainly based on the strong wish from the studbooks to obtain a genetic alternative to the more traditional breeding methods which are often not feasible in the smaller breeds. For each disease, a genetic component to disease susceptibility has been confirmed and several research groups in Europe have independently carried out small to medium-sized studies in order to find the causative genetic mechanisms underlying the disorder. However, the mode of inheritance for these diseases appears to be complex, and no genes or mutations have been identified yet, suggesting that analysis of much larger sample sizes is required or across datasets.
