Our students are very multicultural but have little experience or understanding of what it means to be part of Europe.  Our principal visited the municipality of Jarfalla, Sweden in 2013 and in January 2015 we hosted the headteacher Johan Nystrom Hjertvinge and colleagues from Viksj\u00f6skolanon a visit to Saint Gabriel's College, which was supported by the local authority international officer.  At that visit we put together plans for a joint project which can improve professional practice in teaching and learning between the two schools.Through self-evaluation and external monitoring (Ofsted), Saint Gabriel's College has identified areas for development in teaching and learning. These areas have been built into the schools development plan and various strategies have been initiated throughout this year to address ways in which teachers can develop new teaching methods. This 'Dedication to Excellence' project address just one aspect of the development plan, developing international links in order to develop the quality of teaching. The areas we would like to address are as follows:Differentiation in the mixed-ability classroom - The school has recently changed from setting to mixed ability for key stage 3. Staff feedback have highlighted that there is a need for staff to develop strategies of teaching mixed ability as this is something they feel they struggle with.Challenge for higher ability learners - The demographic of pupil applying for Saint Gabriel's College is changing. Whereas previously pupils were less able (Low band and middle band) they are now more able in Year 7. It is essential our teachers are skilled enough to address this. Ofsted feedback, Lesson observations from the senior leaders and also data analysis has highlighted this as a major area for improvement. Assessment - Nationally, levels no longer exist and schools are required to create their own strategies to assess learners understanding. Citizenship (including citizenship of the EU) - Whilst many of the students at Saint Gabriel's come from across the world, mainly from West Africa and the Caribbean, they have very little understanding of what it means to be a member of of the European Union.  Likewise many staff have little experience of engagement with the EU. Curriculum Improvements - The government have recently overhauled the curriculum for 2016 - 2017. These are now very loose and faculties are responsible for the first time, for ensuring the curriculum meets the needs of all pupils (I.e. that it is broad and balanced) and that it is engaging and inspirational.Activities will include: - Staff to shadowed subject teachers in their subjects (develop teaching pedagogy/subject knowledge/teaching styles) - Staff to take part in lessons, where language isn't a barrier (develop teaching tools) - Staff to exchange resources (develop the curriculum) - Staff to meet with the leadership team and subject teachers to discuss the structure and how they lead learning (develop leadership and to develop the curriculum) - Staff to take part in day to day school life (develop knowledge of culture)Proficiency in the key teaching areas will be measured through a staff questionnaire before the participant goes, and again after the training has been delivered on their return.  Improvement in the quality of teaching will be measured through lesson observations and learning walk. Improvements to the curriculum will be measured from pupil questionnaires and also from faculty reviews, conducted by the leadership team. Pupil progress will be measured through in-year academic progress through the five Tracking Cycles which take place each year. The impact of the European citizenship dimension will be measured through student participation in the e-Twinning relationship and through assessment of their knowledge, enthusiasm and understanding of the European Union in Citizenship lessons. Cluster groups will collaborate to come up with a way to measure the impact of the strategy that they chose to implement.Moving forward, future strategies will include spreading our findings to ensure the local community benefit. We will disseminate information across our local cluster groups by sharing reports, sharing recommendations and strategies staff devised, overseeing the implementation of strategies in local schools, inviting teachers in the cluster to observe the participants who went to Sweden once they are implementing the best practice learned in their own lessons, ensuring teachers observe other teachers in the cluster once they have adopted and embedded some of the strategies.", "http://www.saintgabrielscollege.org", "Saint Gabriel's College", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023994_coordinator"], ["8RR", "EU Achieving Change Through Sports!", "LionHeart In The Community", 16024.0, "EU Achieving Change Through Sports (EU ACTSports!) encourages 24 young people to participate in a bilateral Youth Exchange between the UK & Italy in August 2016, focusing on: ending discrimination; Empowering young people to become Active Citizens; developing personal and work-based skills;  and developing young people\u2019s understanding of culture on a local, national & EU-level. Participants are aged 16 to 24 years old, and are for the most part Not in Employment, Education or Training. Approx 50% of participants will be from a BAME background or secondary generation migrants, some will be at risk of gangs & officially homeless.  Participants all will have Skills needs, in particular: Communication; Inter-personal; Team; Work-based skills; Punctuality.EU ACTSports! will utilise Sports for Development principles alongside cultural activities to develop participants\u2019 Tolerance, Cultural Understanding, Conflict Resolution tools, Life Skills, Employability, knowledge of their Rights & Responsibilities as EU citizens, & Active Citizenship on local, national & EU-level. Given rising incidences of discrimination and hate crimes in the UK, Italy, and the EU \u2013 EU ACTSports! will offer a platform to discuss discrimination, actively promote social inclusion, and for young people to brainstorm ways they can help reduce rates of discrimination. Sports for Development: EU ACTSports! will utilise team sports as a tool to bring UK & Italy participants and other community groups together on a level playing field and approach the topics of tolerance, social inclusion, and conflict resolution through strategically adapted sports activities. Cultural awareness: EU ACTSports! will bring different young people from different countries & cultures together for an unique cultural experience. Young people will participate in a series of fun activities utilising non-formal techniques such as: tasting different foods from different cultures; cultural scavenger hunts; listening to music; learning about different cultural groups throughout the EU, specifically in the UK & Italy. For instance, young people will learn about the history and heritage of the UK\u2019s BAME communities and Roma community through walking tours, sports activities, and peer-to-peer discussion. Young people will also learn about the difficulties facing migrants and minority groups in Italy, including the Waldensians and current asylum seekers, through sports and cultural case studies. Active Citizenship: In addition to the knowledge and understanding given through Sports and Cultural activities, EU ACTSports! will teach participants of their rights and responsibilities as EU citizens and ways that they can impact the future for the better. This will be achieved through collaborative workshops, role-plays, and field trips to key institutions \u2013 including Europe House and the UK Supreme Court. Skills development: The development of skills necessary to participation in society and work, including Inter-personal, Leadership, Team-building, Punctuality, and Communication skills, will be integrated into all activities involve in EU ACTSports! Additionally, the last day of activities within each country will involve reflections on the whole trip as well as an Employability session designed to enhance participants abilities to identify, apply & obtain work, while also ensuring long term employment. Employability skills sessions will include: CV building; Jobsearch skills; Interview techniques; Mock interviews; & Peer-to-Peer guidance. Young people will also learn new language skills both in English & Italian and will be encouraged to continue of their new language skills beyond the youth exchange. LITC and Commissione Sinodale per la Diaconia will continue to support participants after the Youth Exchange in accessing long-term employment. EU ACTSports! will immediately impact on the attitudes, understanding, confidence, and job-readiness of participants. Attitudes towards other countries and groups as well as their attitudes towards participation in civic life will change. The skills and knowledge developed through this project will also help participants move into long-term employment- with further support offered to all participants by LITC and Commissione Sinodale per la Diaconia. These immediate impacts will have a further impact on participants peer groups as well as their communities as EU ACTSports! will challenge participants to brainstorm ways that they can help bring an end to discrimination \u2013 with LITC and Commissione Sinodale per la Diaconia offering support to realise their proposals.

This project will build upon this success and ensure that a large number of our staff members will gain a deeper understanding of how to effectively teach and support EAL students and their families.  They will acquire this understanding during an intensive week of immersion in Spanish, during which they will also gain a deeper understand of what it means for our school to be a European school and for the UK to be a member of the EU.  Whilst in Spain, participating staff will learn about the culture and history of the host country giving them a deeper knowledge of another EU country.  Further to this, we intend to strengthen European dimension of our citizenship curriculum so students and staff have a sound understanding of the context in which the Brexit debate has taken place.\r\n\r\nWe aim to improve the Spanish speaking abilities of participants, and provide them with an valuable learning experience, which they will apply to their professional practice when working with EAL students.  Alongside improvements in the achievement of EAL students, the citizenship curriculum regarding understanding of the workings of the EU and what it means to be a citizen of an EU country will be enhanced.  The quality of learning in citizenship lessons regarding the EU will also be outstanding, because participating staff members will be able to relate their experience of the project and the insights they have gained to students in lessons.\r\n\r\nThis project is essential for staff in the school to gain a real insight into the experiences of many of our students who arrive in the UK speaking no English, and dislocated from their wider families and communities.  They have to quickly adapt to their new surroundings and deal with the complexities of life in a school in a different culture.  By giving our staff an taste of an equivalent experience which they could not have in the UK, we expect, as a school community, that our expertise in developing EAL students and our citizenship curriculum will be greatly enhances.
