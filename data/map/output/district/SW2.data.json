According to the literature, western notion of ideal body causes serious and longstanding stress effects especially among young people and women. This often leads to body dissatisfaction and even hate from their own bodies. This fact that doctors call \u201cbody dissatisfaction disorder\u201d usually brings up some behaviors (like hard diet, fasting, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) that harm physical and psychological health. It also forces young people to various kinds of operations and consumptions of beauty products, exercises of getting thin or muscle development, etc. \r\nMany researches highlight the seriousness of this problem. A survey conducted in the UK with 2000 young girls, for example, found out that %70 of them do not like their faces and that only %8 are happy with their bodies. Similarly, another research found out that %53 of 13-year old young American girls are dissatisfied with their bodies and that %78 of 17-year old young American girls are dissatisfied with their bodies. the Australian Longitudinal Study of Women's Health on the other hand found out that %72 of 18-22 old Australian young women wish to loose wight and that only %25 of women in this age group is happy with their body. \r\nSimilar tendencies are seen among young people of nonwestern countries as well.

The polymer film and waste are then transported to energy-generating Anaerobic Digestion systems in existing Wastewater Treatment utility infrastructure or small-scale onsite systems.\n\nThe events industry unlocks a business opportunity for Loowatt that could be worth ~\u20ac2m in revenue p.a. by 2017 and ~\u20ac20m revenue p.a. by 2020. Loowatt hopes to expand into Continental European Markets through joint venture models with European toilet service providers, reaching 5.2 million EU customers by 2020.  \nHaving achieved traction in Events market, Loowatt will build traction in the Construction and Humanitarian Response sectors.  \n\nLoowatt\u2019s goals align with the European need for innovative technologies to assure environmental sustainability, maintain people\u2019s well-being, and remain competitive in a changing world.", 41995.0, 59993.0, 1, 1, "LOOWATT", null, null, null, "h2020_204361_927120084"]]}}, "3NJ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2014, "Raising the profile of Spanish across the Curriculum and making cross curricular links", "Streatham Wells Primary School", 8909.0, 1, 1, "We are a small ,one form primary school in the South West of London.

The main objective of this project is the introduction of a third, final and vital component to secure the success of teaching our students bilingually: Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL).\r\n\r\nTo turn CLIL into reality, our MFL Department last summer hired a CLIL expert, Dr Nina Lancaster, who in turn has put us in contact with Dr Mar\u00eda Luisa Perez Ca\u00f1ado, an international researcher on CLIL at The University of Ja\u00e9n.

City Heights is unique among secondary schools because of its specialism in Spanish and also its commitment and promotion of bilingualism with parents and students. We see it as a real necessity working in what probably is the most cosmopolitan city in the world . This means that our professional and academic obligation to serve a large population of EAL and bilingual students is real and urgent. If we want our pupils to succeed in an increasingly competitive global market -even withouth having to leave the UK- we must address the need for having better trained, more valued, a bit happier and therefore much more motivated teachers who can install in children -often from very diverse and sometimes difficult backgrounds- the idea of a being an European and global citizen. This also mean for teachers to know how to deal with the historical and cultural expectations of different communities and cultures if we want to map out a better future for our students. The project has the participation of 22 teachers, including our Principal, three subject directors (MFL, Humanities and Art), three MFL teachers, fourteen non MFL teachers and a Local Authority consultant who is also a teacher of Portuguese in our school. The idea is to expand the scope and number of language training opportunities that we are already providing at City Heights for teachers and parents. We want to offer to a large number of colleagues the opportunity to improve their language and pedagogic skills so in turn they become a working force that understands and embraces bilingualism. The activities, expanded over a period of two years, include six idiomatic language courses with teachers immersing for five days in Spanish, French or Portuguese learning. These structured training courses will be complemented by pre-departure research plus language and culture familiarisation done in our school and a continuation of their language training on their return. The aim is for many teachers as possible to reach an advance beginners-intermediate level. Participating teachers will be asked to prepared a portfolio with material they can use in lessons on their return to UK. Much of that material is expected to be included in also in presentations used during assemblies and tutorial times at least twice a month.There will also be a two job-shadowing exercises for teachers, including our Principal and two more Management Team  members, to share good practice, familiarise with other EAL methodologies, language teaching and expand the number of European contacts for future projects and initiatives. In this sense we have already requested the assistance of our language in helping us to identify future potential partners in Spain and France. As a result, we expect a much more academically integrated school working crosscurriculary, confident about the teaching and learning of foreign languages and much more in tune with the social, political and cultural realities of other European nations and cities. This plus the conviction that we will be ble to provide our teachers with a better working environment and better career prospects within the UK and beyond.   It is within this exciting but demanding circumstances that we want to develop a long term strategy to demostrate to students, teachers, parents and the larger community we serve many of the benefits of being part of Europe. European Heights is a very important piloting project for us because it will help us to consolidate our central educational ethos of the \"Growth Mindset\" by offering our teachers and students the possibility of becoming better at being themselves.

Our teaching stages include Compulsory Secondary Education, A-level and Basic, Middle and Higher Vocational Studies. Our students come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, mostly working and middle-class families.\r\nIt is necessary to mention the high rate of students that do not succeed at the stage of Secondary Education (18%) as a weakness that needs to be improved as it is higher than the average in Andaluc\u00eda (16%) and nationally (11%). Absenteeism is also a frequent problem.\r\nAs regards teachers, it is important to highlight that the staff turnover is low and there is high degree of participation in educational programs and European Projects (Erasmus+  intermediate and advanced vocational courses and linguistic immersion courses abroad).\r\nAreas to improve involve: 1) School management competences. 2) Methodological tools to improve linguistic competence in Modern Foreign Languages. 3) Methods of teaching and learning for bilingual programs and attention to diversity in order to improve academic results and student absenteeism.\r\nB. Objectives.\r\nWe aim to achieve the following objectives:  improve school inclusion, motivation and student performance by drastically reducing the poor performance of students and early drop-out-rates, the use of CLIL methodology and the implementation of cooperative learning and Project Based Learning in order to employ a more effective methodology overall to boost school integration, social inclusion and student motivation.\r\nC.
