However, they need a further boost to allow them to teach the complexities of the new GCSE to a consistently high standard. They need to focus on more complex language, and hone pronunciation skills, to give our GCSE pupils excellent teaching and ensure that the use of French, German and Spanish incorporates changes in the language, new vocabulary etc. Strategically, it would also be a good idea to improve staff\u2019s competency in their second languages, as well as the competency of non-MFL staff, in order to address staffing issues such as cover and maternity leave when they arise.\r\n\r\nIn line with the new KS3 National Curriculum and new GCSE syllabus we also need to broaden staff cultural knowledge.\r\n\r\nPrevious participants have recognised the huge benefit derived from participation in our previous project.

We also want to Improve transition from KS2 to KS3, make links with teachers in Spain and France, improve cultural awareness to engage and inspire our pupils and see how languages are taught abroad to enable us to share good practice. Another of our aims is to develop creativity in language teaching and encourage collaborative working.\r\n\r\nWe would like to have seven members of staff take part in training courses in Spain or France over the course of two years. The course and will involve language learning, intercultural understanding and immersion, methodology and pedagogy and the opportunity and time in a French or Spanish school. This will develop their professional skills and improve their future prospects.\r\n\r\nThe impact we envisage from this project is an improvement in attainment within languages and better trained staff with increased professional profiles. There will be more availability of languages in our school, giving our children more choice. They will also get a better teaching experience no matter which language they choose due to our teachers improved skills. This will impact on our children\u2019s learning and enjoyment of languages and will also give them more options for the future. \r\n\r\nWe hope to develop strong international links and increase in contact with native speakers and eTwinning. This will lead to the development of joint projects and resources. These links will also lead to a general improvement in our cultural awareness. Teaching will generally improve as teachers\u2019 confidence improves. There will be more creativity within our teaching and better use made of cross curricular links. Staff will develop much more confidence and will have better abilities to work in different year groups and teach different languages. They will work collaboratively and build their teamwork skills leading to better outcomes for the Department and the school.", "http://www.stockportschool.net/Content/Home/Default.aspx", "Stockport School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002054_coordinator"]]}}}}
