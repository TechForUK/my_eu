We will establish a French Club for extra curricular activities which will be open for Key Stage two children with a particular interest in learning French.  We will begin to teach French to a Year group, with a view to incorporating other year groups as our confidence grows in delivering a foreign language.

It will be monitored for its impact by the project team and governors.  We are expecting to see a rise in the cultural understanding levels of the children taking part in these activities and the acquirement of high frequency words by those learning the language.
