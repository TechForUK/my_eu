The formulations of all the inks will be given in the standard and so freely available. To date, no rapid screening method for assessing photocatalyst activity exists outside the use of such inks and ISO and CEN have no plans at present to introduce a standard based on these inks, although many members of the photocatalyst community and relevant ISO and CEN communities use them. The key project objectives are: i) prepare appropriate, different photocatalyst inks and typical photocatalyst samples based on glass, tiles, paint, concrete and fabrics for round robin tests, ii) conduct a series of round robin tests that identify the best inks and protocol for each very different coating substrate, iii) present the results and conclusions of the round robin tests to the relevant CEN committee (TC386) and use the feedback to improve the prepared draft standard and finally iv) have accepted by TC386 a final CEN standard on photocatalyst activity-measuring inks for subsequent processing and adoption by CEN via TC386. The proposal is fully supported by the chairman of CEN/TC 386 'Photocatalysis' and will address an important need, not yet covered by the current CEN/TC 386 group, namely the rapid assessment of activity using smart inks which can be also used in field tests. The proposal compliments the portfolio of CEN standards currently under development and the project consortium consists of 4 academic and 3 industrial partners, two of which are already active in the CEN/TC 386. The proposed standard ink test for self cleaning surfaces will deliver a new CEN work item in TC 386, which will be invaluable to CEN/TC 386 and help significantly strengthen the position of European industry.'", 50994.0, 440935.0, "INTEC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cristalarabia.com", null, "fp7_104751_953443750"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["2DY", "EURO TRADING, YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS ON THE MOVE", "Coomb Briggs Primary School", 101689.0, "\u201dEntrepreneurship can be taught, and must be learned.\u201d Doug Richards, School for startups    The title of our project is \"Euro trading, young entrepreneurs on the move.\"   The aim of our project is to develop our pupils into young entrepreneurs. The well-planned programme will adopt a skills-based approach and provide real-life business opportunities which will apply Literacy, Numeracy, Thinking and IT skills.  The Entrepreneurship learning will be integrated into our Curriculum, and will be effectively coordinated by members of staff at each school. The pupils will be encouraged to use their previous knowledge and skills, and to use their own initiative to develop their own business. The activities will include problem-solving and team working opportunities. In order to engage our pupils, we will invite visitors from the local community to give an insight into the range of different successful methods of running a business, and to provide the learners with some ideas for a product. We will establish a positive IT link by embracing social media, such as \u2018You Tube\u2019 and \u2018Facebook\u2019.     Our project outcomes will be for our pupils to develop a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, to be creative in their thinking, to develop their social skills by negotiating, listening and persuading, and to be organised when running their business. All pupils will be supported by dedicated staff that will also be developing their own entrepreneurial skills further.  There will be six European countries participating in the project. Pupils, Teachers and Support Staff from each institution will be part of the project. We will also include our local authorities, our local businesses, and local schools within our areas, local media, School Governors and the local communities.     During the first year we will focus on establishing their own travel agency which will provide opportunities for the children to apply for various jobs. Several activities will stem from the creation of the business, such as role play activities, experiences to improve confidence, team building workshops, and learning about different countries. IT will be used to create brochures, logos, presentations, websites, graphs and booklets. The Internet will also be used for research purposes, such as finding and locating information on European countries within the project, and for ideas on choosing a product for marketing. Once the travel agent is established, the focus will then begin on starting a business. We will invite guest speakers with a business background into the schools to work closely with the pupils and teachers. Once ideas for products have been chosen, there will be a voting system within each school. During the second year, the children will begin on their venture, which will be to create and market their product.  The process will begin with support from local businesses, guest speakers and local educational authorities teaching the children about the importance of advertising. We will invite relevant guests into the school in-order to introduce the power of successful publicity. Possibly Secondary pupils with excellent IT skills will be invited to support and teach the Primary children. In order to advertise on an international level, we will use qr codes and Social Media such as \u2018You Tube\u2019. The impact of successful advertising will demonstrate the power of persuasion. The children will create their product in preparation for their first fair in November. Children will then need to price their product, taking into account that they will need to cover costs and make a profit. The children will be responsible for counting their finances, banking their profit, paying bills and learning the importance of saving. The impact of this task will demonstrate the pupil\u2019s capability and develop their self-confidence within Numeracy. They will also be made aware of the different currencies. With the business up and running, the attention of the pupils will return to the travel agency, creating a travel magazine which will be the final product.      The project will have a positive impact on our pupils, teachers and on the local community, opening doors for new ideas and exciting ventures for the future. Questionnaires for pupils, staff and parents will be used to discover the success of the programme. All results will be published on our website, etwinning, our school website and on Facebook in order to hopefully benefit other ventures in the long term. All activities and products will be displayed in our Erasmus corner for parents, pupils and visitors to view. We are very hopeful that our project will change our pupils\u2019 thinking, embed a positive attitude and develop their entrepreneurial capability for possibly starting their own businesses in the economic environment they live in.", "http://www.coombbriggsprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA219-025377_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN40"}
