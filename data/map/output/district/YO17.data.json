In Camphill culture, volunteering is understood to be a rewarding way to make a positive impact on the lives of others, as well as being a wonderful opportunity to develop new skills and abilities.

It is a one-year volunteering placement including eight volunteers from EU countries.\r\n\r\nVolunteers with CVT Gloucestershire provide support to vulnerable adults while working alongside them in our gardens and various crafting workshops, at the same time developing knowledge and practical skills that serve them well for the rest of their lives. Volunteers also participate in artistic and cultural events, including concerts, theatre performances, and festival celebrations. They receive mentorship support to pursue their own inspirations and to create personal EVS projects. \r\n\r\nThe presence of young, international volunteers contributes immeasurably to the cultural enrichment of the people we support and our three communities, as well as helping the people we support realise their full potential in workshop activities. The volunteers, meanwhile, benefit from relating to our residents with special needs. Developing meaningful friendships with learning-disabled people opens the minds and hearts of young people to an understanding of true human worth. The volunteers are inspired by the wisdom and patience of those who have spent their lives managing or overcoming a variety of disabilities. \r\n\r\nThe volunteers benefit as well from the intercultural experience provided at CVT Gloucestershire. They undertake many cultural and leisure activities together with EVS volunteers at the nearby ASHA Centre. They form close, lasting friendships with one another and in the process, develop intercultural sensitivities and perspective on their own identities in relation to the EU.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits to young volunteers with our organisation are the development of language and interpersonal communication skills, perspective on the realities of running an active charity, and many other hands-on skills, all of which enhance their employability and expand their options after this project\u2019s completion. Another objective of the project concerns the personal development, inner growth, self-worth, happiness, and physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing of each participant. Mentorships are established as a means of supporting the growth of each individual.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefits to CVT Gloucestershire communities include the continuation of workshop activity which is vulnerable due to lack of funding and would in fact, without volunteer involvement, be impossible.
