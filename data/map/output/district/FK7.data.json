Towards this end, OpenCube project will develop open source software tools in terms of (a) standalone applications and (b) extensions of two linked data management platforms, namely Swirrl's PublishMyData and fluidOps' Information Workbench, for publishing and reusing high-quality linked statistical data.Although the Open Government Data (OGD) movement promised to provide a number of benefits, recent studies show that its full potential has not yet realized. The difficulty in exploiting open data seems surprising if we consider the huge importance data have in modern societies e.g. in business intelligence, research models and evidence based policy-making.The main tenet of OpenCube project is that the real value of OGD will unveil from performing data analytics and advanced visualizations on top of open statistical data that were previously resided in disparate sources and can now be combined to provide unexpected and unexplored insights. However, statistical data need to be formulated and integrated as linked Data Cubes characterized by dimensions, slices and measures in order to unveil their full potential and value.Towards this end, the OpenCube project aims at developing software tools to address the particular requirements of Data Cubes, thus enabling the efficient and easy publishing and reuse of open statistical data. In particular the OpenCube project will support (a) public bodies to publish linked statistical data of high quality in an easy way and (b) European SMEs to combine linked open statistical data with other data (e.g. enterprise's own data) and perform advanced data analytics and visualizations in a cost effective manner.The OpenCube foreseen results include:\u0095\\t  The OpenCube toolkit comprising standalone tools for publishing, visualizing and performing data analytics on top of linked statistical data.\u0095\\t  The OpenCube extension of the PublishMyData platform.\u0095\\t  The OpenCube extension of the Information Workbench platform.\u0095\\t  The OpenCube Pilots in three public authorities and businesses to validate and prove the usability and effectiveness of the developed tools and guidelines.", 146157.0, 1001938.0, "OpenCube", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110723_965196464"], ["7WT", "Data Publishing through the Cloud: A Data- and Platform-as-a-Service Approach for Efficient Data Publication and Consumption", "Swirrl It Limited", "While in recent years a large number of datasets has been published as open (and often linked) data, applications utilizing these open and distributed data have been rather few. Reasons include, amongst others, the technical complexity and cost of publishing and providing access to the data, lack of monetization incentives on the provider side, and lack of simplified and unified solutions for data consumption in a multi-platform way. The DaPaaS project directly addresses these challenges by developing a software infrastructure combining Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for open data, with the aim of optimizing publication of Open Data and development of data applications. Addressing the data consumption aspect by developing novel cross-platform interfaces to data applications, DaPaaS extensively covers the life cycle of cost-efficient data publishing and consumption. Backed by the development of a methodology for data use in the DaPaaS infrastructure, the project will deliver an intuitive platform that simplifies data publication, as well as cross-platform data consumption, thus enabling a sustainable infrastructure for efficient and simplified reuse of open data. Core innovations include: an open DaaS and PaaS, unified Linked Data access, integrated DaaS and PaaS for open data, lowering the complexity of open data publishing and consumption for non-experts.Sustainable exploitation of the project results is ensured through a strong participation of SMEs in the consortium.

Recent crises such as BSE, swine fever, foot and mouth disease and avian influenza, and the activities of consumer and animal welfare organisations have raised public awareness that animal production is more than just an industry and that many other issues have to be considered. In this project, we focus on the fact that farm animal welfare has become an issue of increasing public significance and concern. Recent surveys indicated that European citizens show a strong commitment to animal welfare and many consumers express a willingness to pay a premium price for a product emanating from a welfare-friendly production system (Eurobarometer, 2007). But their expressed willingness often fails to result in purchase. Consumers\u2019 apparent reluctance to actually buy these products in the shop may at least partly reflect a lack of transparency in the market for animal products, (consumers are unable to recognise animal friendly products), as well as the limited assortment of such products. Clearly, it is extremely important for the industry, both from a corporate social responsibility and a market point of view, to re-build and maintain consumer trust related to how food-producing animals are housed and handled across Europe. This requirement demands the development of credible, reliable and transparent welfare assessment systems as well as product information and certification schemes to support communication to the consumer about the ways in which the animal food products are produced. The present project addresses the above needs by developing a Stakeholder Platform (European Animal Welfare Platform; EAWP) that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in order to effectively support the implementation of scientifically based welfare assessment and information systems, improvement strategies, market initiatives, research and development and policy formulation in the area of farm animal welfare. The partners in this project represent animal welfare organisations, major companies in the animal production sector and leading research institutions.

This will make the industry more competitive and more ethical at the same time.", "Consumer concern about animal farming practices and animal welfare has increased in recent years, prompting the EU to focus on improving how farm animals are treated and make efforts to instil confidence in society. The EU-funded project 'European animal welfare platform: Adding welfare quality to food' (EAWP) sought to support this vision. The project brought together many different stakeholders in the supply chain, namely producers, processors, retailers, animal welfare organisations and academic experts.\n\nBuilding on previous EU initiatives in the field, the team supported welfare assessment and improvement strategies, in line with research and development (R&D) priorities in the field. It identified key welfare issues in beef and dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and fish. The partners then produced a total of 58 strategic approach documents (SADs). Each SAD focuses on a specific welfare problem and documents the likely causes and consequences, the relevant legislation, and existing best practices. It also sets short and long-term goals for welfare and economic improvement as well as prioritising future R&D. Thus, many important recommendations emerged from the project and these were prioritised for each product group.\n\nThe overall results were communicated via the project's website, as well as through press releases, newsletters and conference presentations.\n\nIn effect, the project built a powerful platform to facilitate the exchange of resources and expertise on the topic. This will help ensure the better welfare of animals as well as creating a solid framework for achieving related objectives. Such an integrated approach will help address the needs of consumers and industry, thereby encouraging more sustainable and ethical European agriculture by improving the welfare of our farmed animals. Furthermore, it will support the development of an EU action plan on animal welfare and protection, positioning the bloc as a global leader in this respect.

Our institution is situated within a well-established, seasonal touristic location, which has and will continue to have a great impact on the community and its inhabitants. Tourism is the foundation for most of the economy in Mallorca and provides employment to a large part of our student population. Thus, employability is one thing we can contribute to.Although a majority of the students are diverse in key competences, they can be can categorized into three main groups according to their needs and origin.The first group consists of students who dropped out of secondary school before graduation, probably due to a history of absences and lack of motivation. Despite the lack of formal education, many of these students have an acceptable understanding of various foreign languages. The second group is made up of foreign students who come to our institution in search of training, either to become literate, or to achieve basic linguistic competency in any of the official languages. In this diverse group we find a wide range of people including immigrants, refugees, and a large population of German residents that have moved to the island. However, due to various circumstances they have not learned the native language. For this reason their assimilation into the culture is not easy. Language competency is essential in order to be able to integrate into our community without facing communicative obstacles. The third group consists of those who work and study to further their education through the preparation of standardized access exams. Students will be required to be proficient in foreign languages, mainly English.  The faculty of our school is more than qualified in their areas of expertise, but still there is a need for improvement in foreign language competence following the new standards that the European Union promotes for 2020. Linguistic competence is essential for social cohesion, personal and economic development, and professional mobility. From our perspective, multilingualism is a key value that not only favours different cultures living together, but also greatly increases the probability of job placement.Our objective as a professional institution is to not only work towards improving the linguistic skills of our staff in order to strengthen the European dimension of our school as a whole, and break communication barriers, but also to develop strategies to minimize the student drop out rate. If the linguistic competency in foreign languages is not proficient this has a direct impact on the range of courses that we can offer, as well as the communication with the students. By eliminating these barriers of communication it may enhance the dedication of the students within their educational communities.  On a broader scale the advancement and the impact of this project will be disseminated in different ways throughout the community. On the one hand institutions related to adult education in other European countries, will host us for job shadowing and  serve as a platform for future collaborations. On the other hand the conclusions extracted from this job shadowing experience regarding the diminishment of the drop out rate will be diseminated to other teachers throughout organized conferences in the regional teacher training centres in our area.
