In 2016 the number of dropouts in Aix-Marseille Academy ranked second in France and the number of people with \u201cvulnerabilities in economic, family and cultural terms\u201d is the highest in France - 45% of the population. Within the age group of 15-24 years old the Academy has a dropout rate of 28.8% in comparison to 25.4% for France. (CEREQ)\r\nWithin this dropout rate, the highest number comes from vocational high schools. An effective way to limit early school leaving and contribute to the Erasmus + 2020 objectives is to create a dynamic environment in vocational high schools. This will allow students from disadvantaged socio-cultural backgrounds, often coming from migrant families or rural areas with fewer mobility opportunities to do their work experience in a European country.\r\nDue to the severity of the issue as described above, along with our previous successes, we the steering committee (DAREIC, GIP FCIP and the PACA Region) wish to support 42 vocational high schools in the implementation of work experiences in Europe for 902 less privileged students studying for the Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel during a 24 month period (689 Erasmus mobility grants and 213 Region co financing).\r\nThe main objective is to give them the opportunity to live an experience that will be an essential added value for their socio-professional integration. In practical terms, reinforced assistance will be offered by using specialized structures in supporting the mobility of young people having fewer opportunities through non-formal educational methods. We will work with the Eurocircle association.\r\nWhen they return to France, the participants of the project will pass on their experience, enhancing the project within the school.  They will thus act as spokesmen for European mobility, inspiring the desire and motivation to their peers. Pupils will use European certificates (Europass CV) and will receive a Europass Mobility and Mobility credits.\r\nGIP FCIP, the project initiator, will facilitate administrative and financial procedures in partnership with the schools financial management services.

The consortium members will put into effect various activities and will be a source of inspiration via a mentoring scheme and the establishment of a collaborative platform named M@gist\u00e8re.\r\nExperiences and skills gained by expert teams will help mentor new educational teams. This project will facilitate the sharing of knowledge, good practice and collaboration with the aim of improving the quality of international mobility across the consortium partners.\r\nThe DAREIC would also like to create a network of local businesses that would improve the quality of the work placements. The local businesses would work with us to identify businesses in Europe thanks to their subsidiaries or customers. The Region is a stakeholder in the creation of this network with a progressive involvement over the long term. \r\nThe objective of this project is to provide these young people with the opportunity to experiment mobility in order to widen their future employment horizons.

Partnerships are underrepresented in countries where the languages are dominant in learning. International is rarely integrated as a strategic setting in schools, while it becomes essential for families, employers and students. The academy is facing significant social challenges favoring forms of segregation. Openness to the world is to help build new representations; cultural diversity should be presented as a virtue and an opportunity rather than as a liability. A bearing effect is therefore imperative so that the international irrigates the academy and contributes to the Erasmus + 2020 objectives.In 2014, the number of dropouts in Aix-Marseille Academy reached 12.7%, ranking second in France.

Schools have a limited knowledge on skills, capacity and development of the  incoming students.  This creates a risk that newly arrived do not take part in the ordinary school work, which leads to segregation. Teachers and guidance coaches lack of strategies and methods for support newcomers increase the problems of inclusion. The four partners from Helsingborg, Kent County, Antwerp and Brussels have agreed to act together in order to strengthen our organizations with competence to effectively support young newcomers to be included in education or training. The project focuses on four different perpectives. These are Mapping/Screening, Initial learning processes, Methodolgy/Tools and Guidance. Target groups are staff working \"hands on\", teachers, school leaders, counselors, support staff, teacher trainers, follow-up/career coaches, stakeholders and policymakers. Within the project we estimate to reach over 4000 people and with the extended dissemination activities many more. Today, the need to exchange and share experiences are crucial on these issues.The benefit of doing this in a European context is that the issue concerns most European countries with different cultural and educational approaches but the same challenges. Each within its context these approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. By comparing these experiences and approaches  and learning from one another the partners each will be able to actively update the effectiveness of working processes. The project will arrange seven project meetings, four transnational training activities, sixteen local learning and dissemination events and two major dissemination conferences. Action learning will be the approach to all work. Action learning is a form of experiential learning and involves a systematic search for good action. A cyclical process of experiential learning consisting of four parts: plan, action, observation and reflection. Theory and practice must be linked together.  The method \"Dialogue Conference\" will be used at project meetings, local learning/dissemination events and the final dissemination conferences. Documentation will be carried out by a reflective method and current research will be presented at the project meetings.The expected impact on participants is the gaining of new skills and knowledge leading to new methods in work with newly arrived students. The overall goal is that this expected impact ultimately will affect the newly arrived students ' opportunities for inclusive learning. At local level the teachers will get increased knowledge and methodology to be able to work in a multilingual environment. The student will as a consequence of this be more involved in the learning process. Within the regional network of municipalities the knowledge will reach out to more stakeholders with the same challenges.

Today, the educational systems must contribute to  increasing key competences, both basic and cross competences,  in particular the entrepreneurship and the language competences.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership is composed of 8 institutions from 5 countries, thus representing several stakeholders:\r\nFive European partner high schools cooperate over the definition of the competences to develop and/or select the materials to create several formative paths, carry out the project preparation phase and manage all the organization details;\r\nTwo/three European partners of proven reliability contribute to enrich the schools\u2019 education process by helping the schools in carefully selecting materials, methods and tools;\r\nTwo/three European intermediary partners like social partners and higher education institutions, support the project at national level and promote the continuous improvement of education and training systems.\r\n\r\nThis is what  the partnership has scheduled:\r\nimplementation of  innovative teaching/learning units   (innovative in methods, techniques and the use of  ICT); every school's results will be  4 teaching/learning units which will be tested with students and recommended  as best practices;\r\ntranslation of modules available on OER platforms into the language of the partnership (Italian, French, Spanish, Turkish); social and economics  fields of study will be preferred; the partner schools will translate the contents related to the learning pathways into their own language and these will be tested and used with students;\r\nplanning of an online awareness marketing campaign related to the  most relevant fields in which the school operates and contributes its efforts.\r\n\r\nHere are the priority objectives:\r\nThe project intends to foster the provision and the assessment of key-competences, including basic skills and transversal skills particularly digital skills, languages and entrepreneurship.\r\nIt promotes take-up of innovative practices in education, by supporting personalised learning approaches, cooperative learning and critical thinking, strategic use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), open educational resources (OER), open and flexible learning, virtual mobility and other innovative learning methods; it enhances the professional development of those working or active in the education fields by innovating and increasing the quality and range of initial and continuing training, including new pedagogies, ICT-based methodologies and use of OER,  it gives the possibility to develop communication skills and to master a foreign language; it promotes structured inter-regional and cross-border cooperation and enhances the commitment of local,  regional and international public authorities in the qualitative development of the education.\r\n\r\nAs for the production of learning outcomes, modules, translation of OER materials and planning of a marketing campaign are the expected results.\r\nAs far as mobilities are concerned, over the two years' project, we  plan to set up:\r\nthree transnational meetings of  teachers,  two transnational meetings of a delegation of a few students and   teachers, a final meeting including a transnational  conference for teachers, students and national stakeholders.

One of our main objectives is the understanding of different cultures and educate our students in a comprehensive manner, with the participation of their families and therefore improving our social environment, while providing them with the opportunity to complete their education through various activities, school exchanges and cultural trips.We have had an experimental program in CLIL (multilingual) from the 2009-2010 school year. Over the last seven years, a total of 10 teachers of different subjects (Math, Arts, Theater, Technology, Geography and History and Physical Education) have taught Units in English, French and Italian. Our students have benefited from teaching content in a foreign language at different levels of learning (from their 1st year to their last year).Our primary goal with this project is to expand the multilingual pilot program progressively, so that eventually we can establish a line in a foreign language (English) in our center, and thus adapt to the increasing demand in this sense that we are living in our society and more specifically in our city, Vila-real. We also want to establish a European Development Plan so that all the activities that we perform get effectively transmitted to our environment (teachers, parents, students and the social environment of the School).We want to establish measurable objectives for the coming school year 2016/2017, which will include:- Increasing to 10% teachers with specific training in Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL).- Increasing to 15% the staff and students involved in the multilingual pilot program.- Increasing to 20% the staff and students involved in any activity related to mobility and European projects.Teachers who undertake courses, will improve their language proficiency in a foreign language, will improve their ability to use a foreign language as a means of transmitting knowledge, will exchange ideas and experiences with teachers from other European countries, will improve their knowledge the CLIL methodology, will acquire the knowledge to make teaching materials of their subjects in a foreign language, and will improve their digital competition.", "http://www.invicta.kent.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024484_3"], [2014, "The development of students' oral skills for formative and summative assessment", "Invicta Grammar School", 3310.0, 1, 1, "The project results from previous contact between members of the two institutions.  During this contact the differences between the way that French and English schools value and aim to develop students' independent thinking skills was discussed. The Gallic emphasis on the dissemination of knowledge from expert to learner in the classroom to build a strong but predetermined knowledge base was compared to the focus in English speaking schools to develop students as independent thinkers and learners. The Lycee works at the intersection of these two pedagogical approaches as its students are accustomed to the Gallic style in their time spent in the French state system but are then encouraged to focus more on independent thinking skills in their lessons in English. \r\nThe objectives of the exchange project proposed is to share teaching and learning strategies that might bring together the\r\n confident knowledge base developed by the highly conscientious Lycee students with the more interactive approach to learning that is developed through the use of thinking skills 'tools' and strategies to develop independent learners that aim to prioritise skills over knowledge at Invicta.\r\nTwo staff from Invicta will travel to the Lycee to shadow two members of staff. A different two members of staff from Invicta will then be shadowed by two  different members of the Lycee on a return visit.

According to the WHO, by 2030 about 70% of the world's population will live in cities. As citizens of the future our young people need to consider the impact of this statement on town and city planning and attempt to prevent problems such as energy consumption, sustainability of traffic congestion and lack of green space.In order to approach common European challenges of tomorrow, the international scientific community is working together, and so must our schools to develop their approaches to sustainability. Thus,  using a variety of research and design methods networks of students from Great Britain, the Netherlands and Germany will create working prototypes in the key areas of Energy, Transport and Architecture as potential solutions to the problems posed and in order to engineer the \"European Town of the Future\".Our multinational project among three European countries, involving about 65 secondary school students, up to 15 teachers as well as relevant local businesses such as practising architects, energy providers, transport companies and relevant university departments aims to develop:1. An enhanced awareness of sustainable technologies, i.e. an understanding of sustainable technologies in both the students' own and other countries2. The creation of artefacts, ( green car,  smart house)3. An increase in the students\u2019 public speaking and communication skills 4. A greater intensity of cooperation in national and international student teams and an enhanced cultural learning5. The students\u2019 knowledge of ICT and technical terminology as well as everyday English6. An enhanced level of staff co-operation both within each school as well as transnationally.Over the course of two years, one term of five months each, the schools will work on three key areas \u2013 Energy, Traffic and Architecture. With reference to its individual competences each school will take the lead in one key area, which means e.g. supplying the partners with research tasks, language support and also organising one of three transnational learning activities. The remaining fourth term is dedicated to organising a final conference (with students and staff) in 2018, including the exhibition of all artefacts and a presentation of the resulting ideas on the \"Town of the Future, as well as compiling all results and materials in form of a digital archive by all schools together. The target group for the project is 13-15 year old girls and boys as is it anticipated that their participation could inspire them to explore career opportunities within this field. It will also attempt to address the imbalance of gender within the STEM subjects. A project specific website will be developed throughout the duration of the project and linked to the individual schools' websites. As a way of regularly documenting and disseminating the work of the project, students will use a variety of digital approaches such as video recording, computer-aided design and blogging which will be uploaded to the website. Research will be an integral aspect of the project and as such students will use qualitative and quantitative research techniques such as surveys and observations to design a methodology for data collection.By sharing the curricula and sample projects in each school, the students and staff will develop an in-depth understanding of the sustainability issues and approaches to green technologies in each country. By developing this sophisticated level of understanding there is an opportunity to foster community cohesion across the schools within the European Consortium.To develop the project, staff will need to share expertise and resources. This will enhance levels of staff co-operation, mutual understanding and build strong teams for the future. This in turn will impact on levels of student co-operation through the positive role modelling of the teaching staff.The two year project will ensure students acquire specialist skills in STEM subjects and ICT to provide the competencies needed to improve their chances of future employment.  In addition all students will develop a working knowledge of the application of a variety of research methodologies which will support the possibility of lifelong learning.The project will also provide a vocational experience of STEM subjects and will encourage students, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to pursue one or more of these subjects as a career.Potential longer term benefits will include the further development of a European teachers' network, the creation of the sustainable technologies curricula to be used and developed in our and other schools across the European community and the fostering of closer links with industry partners in the fields of STEM subjects and sustainable technologies.", "http://www.valleypark.kent.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-022979_1"]]}}, "5NZ": {"fts": {"data": [[2017, "DGA (UK) LTD", 19002.0, "Legal advice, litigation and infringements \u2014 Legal expenses (25.01.08)", "fts_2017_14605"], [2017, "DGA (UK) LTD", 10249.0, "Legal advice, litigation and infringements \u2014 Legal expenses (25.01.08)", "fts_2017_28498"]]}}}}
