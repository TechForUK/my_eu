Two of the largest and most critical components of any mainstream tidal energy converter (TEC) are the power take off (PTO) system (the shaft, bearings and other equipment which connects the turbine blades with the generator) and the electrical generator itself. Experts in the field of turbine and generator testing, the UK\u2019s Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult (ORE CATAPULT) together with SME partners Tocardo International (TOCARDO),Ocean Flow Energy (OCEANFLOW), Minesto (MINESTO) & FiberSensing (FIBERSENSING) and Research (RTD) performing partners the University of Edinburgh (UEDIN) and SINTEF (SINTEF), plan to conduct vital research and concept design activities to determine the optimum design of a  TEC power take off system and permanent magnet generator (PMG). These radically optimised systems will improve reliability, increase power conversion efficiency and facilitate reduction in the cost of tidal power.  In turn, the results of this project will also help SME tidal developers (and their SME suppliers) to be able to offer warranties and guarantees to end customers (European Energy Utilities) and enable large scale roll out of tidal energy in the EU; supporting diversification of the European energy mix and helping to achieve European 2020 renewable energy and carbon emission reduction targets.\n\nThe formation of the consortium has been carefully considered, in parallel with the resource commitments required to support the proposed programme of work.

Energy analysts have predicted that, if a viable and cost effective technology can be delivered, the deep-water offshore wind market in Europe could meet 50% of Europe\u2019s electricity requirement by 2050. Unlike competitor technologies the simple scalable 'Starfloat' is designed for construction at existing shipbuilding facilities with restricted water depth thus opening up construction opportunities for European shipyards that are currently in decline. The innovative floating foundation design and assembly process takes significant cost out of the CAPEX of deep water floating offshore wind projects and removes the need for risky offshore marine operations. 'Starfloat' therefore has the potential to be disruptive to the current perceived limitations of the offshore wind industry by bring floating offshore wind into the same levelised cost of energy (LCOE) as fixed foundation offshore wind. This will allow the project financing of deeper water wind farm sites, where the wind resource is stronger and more reliable, to be exploited using relatively low risk technology with the end result of reducing carbon emissions and reduced dependency for Europe on imported fuels. It also has the benefit of bringing steel fabrication work to declining shipyards and assembly work to deep-water offshore construction sites that are currently seeing a sharp decline in activity with the fall in the oil price and the collapse of the new shipbuilding market.'", 43584.0, 62263.0, "FLOWSPA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.oceanflowenergy.com", null, "h2020_207129_953689742"], ["1JE", "Fisheries Data Capture and Management System", "Succorfish M2m Limited", "The aim of the FiDaCaMS project is to build a new innovative system that enables fishermen to collect accurate and reliable fisheries and related environmental data in an automated and highly efficient form.\n\nOne of the major issues across the marine environment is that increasingly stringent management controls are being implemented requiring clear & hard evidence to support management decisions. In the absence of such evidence the precautionary approach is adopted, creating restrictions for commercial fishing activities amongst others. At the same time the available resources to gather the evidence centrally is being cut, thus widening the gap between the need and availability of evidence. To aid the fishing industry meet the pressing needs they must be equipped with appropriate tools that collect the evidence in a robust and automated form. \nThe successful implementation of FiDaCaMS will provide the technology necessary for the collection and aggregation of the required data and rendering it available through an online platform in multiple formats across diverse media thus facilitating the adoption of the regulations set by the EU and the local governments. \n\nDuring an event held in Brussels on 5th April 2016 - Info Day for Blue Growth, it was expressed that this sector lacks innovation for Blue Economy specifically in 3 areas (a) lack of highly skilled professionals (b) under investment in Knowledge and technology and (c) a slow process from research results to the commercial stage. The FiDaCaMS project aims to contribute towards overcoming all 3 obstacles.

Staff will network with their fellow teachers in a cross curricular and supportive manner. Careful monitoring of progress with a robus, fair and equitable eward system will ensure that all pupils will make progress regardless of their gender, background, disability or special need. \r\nThe principal objectives include; encouraging children to use physical education, sport and cross curricular outdoor learning as a tool to motivate them to express themselves and be more confident and competent with speaking, reading and writing, Strategies will be put in place to encourage greater engagement from boys, particularly in writing.  It will also provide many opportunities for pupils to be encouraged to follow an active lifestyle, promoting their language and celebrate their own partnership member's sporting culture and heritage and share it with partner countries developing skills in creative cross curricular ways with particular focus on ICT and also to build bridges, and break down barriers between European partners. This project will have a major impact on the pupils' self confidence, self-esteem and interpersonal skills. This strategic partnership will create a strong relationship between the schools involved in the project. It will provide all participants with the opportunity to share innovative teaching methodologies and will fully involve staff, pupils, parents, governors and the much wider community. The main aim of the project is to enlighten participants and the whole local community about the role of physical education, sport and cross-curricular outdoor learning in enhancing basic language and communication skills. We will aim to promote young people's social inclusion and well-being by providing equity and inclusion of disadvantaged participants involved in the project , SEN pupils, those students with learning difficulties,  young people with poor school performance will be provided with stimulating differentaited tasks so that they can achieve and gain enjoyment. Good practices and innovation will be prevalent in this project. There will be mutual respect for partners and each country's expertise in the many areas of the curriculum, in particular, ICT will be harnessed for the benefit of pupils, staff and the schools. We will cooperate with the NGOs, local formal and informal institutions, school's PTA, schools in the local area disseminating the effects and results of the project.\r\nAll participants will be aware of the many benefits of regular exercise whilst at the same time learning how they can become more confident in their literacy classes.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\nAll partners will work collaboratively throughout  the 3 years of the project. A comprehensive resource bank and stimulating ideas around the development of language skills will be incorporated into a Language Learning website. This will be accessible to all.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven that moving to music (developing hand-eye coordination) prior to the commencement of lessons has a dramatic effect on the brain. With this in mind it is for sure that the students will enjoy compiling a series of progressive exercises to be uploaded on to a DVD. This resource can then be shared among partners and the wider community. With sports leaders from each partner school leading fellow pupils through these exercises there is so much scope for them to also develop their language skills\r\n\r\nUltimately all pupils will make gains academically and they will gain in confidence.
