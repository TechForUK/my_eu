There will be no standing heat losses incurred with the innovative technology, saving both energy and money while improving overall efficiency.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, innovation workshops were held to identify the core technology's technical applications. This helped determine potential end users, who were then evaluated to establish the future product's target market and commercial potential and viability.\n\nWork has begun on key components such as the heating element, insulation layers and primary outer casing, and secondary ones like the control system, safe electrical connection and overall system packaging. The core components have already been modelled.\n\nFollowing materials assessment, the graphite element, aluminium nitrate plates and silicon carbide adhesive were identified as the most appropriate combination. The three materials were characterised and then measured, modified and tested in whole or in part.\n\nA prototype of an on-demand electric water heater has been tested in field trials. It may not be long before smaller, lighter and lower-cost RAPIDHEAT products are seen in commercial, industrial and public buildings.

Very few children at Mayflower travel to Europe, but tend to fly over it on their way to the Middle East, Asia and Africa!  Continuing the raise the profile of Europe within school will develop the children's sense of European identity.\r\n\r\nCreative Curriculum:\r\nMayflower Primary School offers a creative curriculum designed to engage the children  through topic based work which covers many different areas of the curriculum.  We aim to make links across the curriculum so reinforcing the learning in different disciplines.  This is working well within school, but with the new curriculum coming into English schools in September 2014, we want to maintain the momentum of creativity and ensure that teachers are re-energised with ideas for developing their classroom practice.  \r\n\r\nModern Foreign Languages: \r\nThe new curriculum requires a modern foreign language to be taught in school from September 2014  Although we have been teaching French for a number of years, it needs a boost of inspiration and ideas to carry our French teaching to the next phase.\r\n\r\nBroaden the European experience of our staff\r\nThese mobilities would enable the European dimension to be fully integrated into our new and developing creative curriculum.\r\n\r\nMobilities:\r\nOver the course of 2 years, we plan to have 6 mobilities by members of school staff to visit a partner institution and shadow outstanding teachers in their classrooms. \r\n- The teachers would plan to learn more about the creative learning-through-play opportunities in Early Years, cross-curricula activities  and active learning opportunities with the older children (particularly in relation to the arts and culture, including digital technologies) and language learning throughout the whole institution\r\n- The visits would improve the teaching and learning of languages and promote the EU's broad linguistic diversity and inter-cultural awareness.\r\n\r\nActivities will include: \r\nworking with a variety of teachers across the school to observe how creativity is promoted through the curriculum.  The staff member will also look at planning and assessment materials, as well as similarities and differences between the school experience for the children.  Staff will also use the opportunity to informally upgrade their language skills and develop a network of supportive professionals in another country to use as a resource. \r\n\r\nMethodology: \r\nWe intend to establish an eTwinning project and use the TwinSpace portal to collate all the evidence related to our visits.  We are already communicating regularly using SKYPE, email and phone calls as well as face to face meetings as part of our Comenius project.  We anticipate building on our very effective communication pathways to develop our relationships futher and include all other relevant stakeholders.\r\nAs part of our Comenius project, we already produce regular reports to staff and Governors at school, as well as delivering whole school assemblies to the children detailing developments and updates.  \r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\nWe would anticipate staff coming back into school full of new ideas and confidence to deliver a more Eurocentric curriculum, which would support the long term aims of the project.\r\n \r\nLong term benefits: \r\n- inspire staff to deliver engaging, cross-curricular, creative lessons.\r\n- increase language confidence and competence.\r\n- Embed European identity firmly throughout the school.", "http://mayflower.j2webby.com", "Mayflower Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001955_coordinator"], ["6HN", "Extending Spanish Teaching and Widening Participation at St Pauls", "St pauls Catholic school", 3742.0, "St Paul's recently introduced Spanish to the curriculum and is now offering an A Level course.

They lack linguistic competences and confidence, and crucially a real understanding of the culture in order to make learning a much richer experience.\r\n\r\nParticipants will prepare for the mobility by assessing their linguistic competences, evaluating the courses they teach and are about to teach, with a view to embedding authentic cultural resources and initiating contact with the link school in Spain. \r\nDuring the mobility, participants will have intensive linguistic training, immerse themselves in the culture of the country and meet their link school partners to set up an international link.\r\n\r\nOn returning from the mobility, participants will share their newly acquired knowledge, skills and the resources that they collected during the mobility.

Our school, which has been involved for a number of years in European Comenius and Erasmus+ projects (our current school project 2015-2017 being an excellent illustration of our past involvement), wishes to offer to a number of voluntary and chosen teachers the possibility to immerge themselves for a week in the life of either an English-speaking school in the UK and/or Malta or a pioneer school in the field of collaborative pedagogics in Finland.This project finds its origin in a deeply felt need for further training, to make our fundamental teaching more lively and therefore more motivating. Participating teachers will collect films, photos and practices during their stays, which can then be used in class to improve their teaching and make them more relevant in the current context. These tools will also be shared with other colleagues via the e-twinning platform.An active pupil participation needs to be based on an assessment of the pupils\u2019 needs and learning profiles. We think that we will be able to benefit from our partners\u2019 successful experience in this field and we wish to learn from them to create an environment that allows our pupils to have fun while learning and that therefore boosts their curiosity and enthusiasm to learn.During their one-week stays abroad, the teachers will be able to observe and participate in a diversity of educational systems. They will focus their attention mainly on the following aspects :- Co-operation within and between classes.- Awareness of multiple intelligence levels and ways of taking them into account when developing differentiating pedagogical practices.- Ways to involve parents in their children\u2019s work and progress at school (parent-teacher relationship and educational co-operation). - Role of the parent-teacher associations in the everyday life of the school and use of web platforms to promote collaboration.- Importance of pupils\u2019 participation in assessment practices.- Role of new technologies (smartboards, blogs, platforms, videoconferences, etc.).- Links between foreign languages and other subjects to promote European citizenship.Albert Camus Elementary School has already been recognised as a pole of excellence in the teaching of foreign languages and wishes to develop its skills in the fields of collaborative and participative work as well. In the longer run and encouraged by this momentum of discovery and openness, our school will undoubtedly manage to transform these new pedagogical practices in order to satisfy the demands of both our pupils and their parents. It will use the practices observed and learned abroad to boost our pupils\u2019 willingness to learn.To train our teachers so that they can become active partners in our pupils\u2019 learning experience is a prerequisite for them to grow and develop into active European citizens.On a side note, we will also apply for a new Erasmus+ Action 2 Co-operation and Partnerships project on parent-teacher relationships.
