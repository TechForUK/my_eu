However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.  There is little guidance on how to incorporate alternative study designs into a development programme to optimally meet the needs of all stakeholders over time.\nThe GetReal consortium aims to improve the efficiency of the medicine development process by better incorporating real-life clinical data into drug development and to enrich decision-making by regulatory authorities and HTA bodies through: \n\u2022\tBringing together regulators, HTA bodies, companies, patients and other societal stakeholders\n\u2022\tAssessing existing processes, methodologies, and key research issues \n\u2022\tProposing innovative (and more pragmatic) trial designs and assessing the value of information\n\u2022\tProposing and testing innovative analytical and predictive modelling approaches\n\u2022\tAssessing operational, ethical, regulatory issues and proposing and testing solutions; \n\u2022\tCreating new decision making frameworks, and building open tools to allow for the evaluation of development programmes and use in the assessment of the value of new medicines; \n\u2022\tSharing and discussing deliverables with, among others, Pharmaceutical companies, regulatory authorities, HTA / reimbursement agencies, clinicians and patient organizations; \n\u2022\tDeveloping trai", 837683.0, 13004527.0, "GETREAL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.nice.org.uk", null, "fp7_203672_984454262"], ["4BT", "European-study on Quantifying Utility of Investment in Protection from Tobacco", "National Institute for Health and Care Excellence", "Tobacco smoking costs the EU an estimated 98 to 130 billion Euros each year \u2013 just above 1% of the EU Gross Domestic Product in 2000.

Our aim is to meet the demands of these diverse markets providing a high performance, low maintenance solution with reduced energy usage and superior operational performance which our extensive market research has validated a significant commercial interest in our objectives.\nEZ-Liner offers major advantages in trenchless relining for long runs of pipe in a single operation with associated reduced labour, reduced energy costs, reduced disruption and reduced time for pipe repairs. By utilising a thermoplastic liner, instead of traditional epoxy methods, the risk of contamination from such chemicals will be eliminated.

This will clear debris in the pipe by water jets, form the liner in the pipe and consolidate with locally produced steam providing reduced energy usage and losses. Focusing steam into a localised area avoids escape into surroundings or damaged pipe, as is prevalent in traditional methods.

More than 2.6 billion cubic metres of drinkable water (30\u00a0% of the overall quantity) are wasted through leaks, which also represents an energy loss. In London alone, 890 million litres of water are lost each day through pipe cracks. Repairs are difficult, slow and costly, but European legislation on drinking water quality is forcing the need to find relevant solutions.\n\nWith EU support, the project 'Novel technology for low cost re-lining of pipe infrastructure' (http://www.ezline.info/ (EZ-LINE)) developed technology that eliminates the need to completely replace old pipes. As a trenchless technology, this system does not require excavation to rehabilitate pipes, but only access to the pipe ends.\n\nThe EZ-LINE solution is a low-cost system and does not incur any increase in the infrastructure cost. Furthermore, it has low-maintenance needs, reduced energy usage and superior operational performance.\n\nTo retrofit old pipes, the EZ-LINE system coats them with a thermoplastic liner from the inside. Compared to other trenchless rehabilitation methods, it does not have any harmful resins and is quick to install as well as ecologically sound, thus conforming to European standards. This conformable thermoplastic fabric is pulled through the pipe, pushed against the inner surface of the defective pipe, heated and consolidated by a novel pig-head design.\n\nDuring consolidation, the liner fabric partially melts to form a smooth, watertight solid sheet of reinforced plastic. Optionally, the liner can be braided with reinforcing fibres. This increases its burst strength, helping it to withstand high water pressures.\n\nConsortium members successfully demonstrated the EZ-LINE rehabilitation process at a partner institute. The relining process was carried out using prototype equipment at a speed of 6\u00a0metres per hour. This speed is expected to increase significantly when using commercial equipment with higher capacity.\n\nThe EZ-LINE system should serve both residential and municipal markets, ensuring continuing function of Europe's pipe networks.

The CCIs are a relevant industry in Europe, and its growth rate is greater than most other industries.  The growing diversity that is currently available in Europe is a very rich resource, which if well-structured, organized and guided can make the CCIs an even more important path for economic growth, job creation, innovation and inclusion for young people from all backgrounds. Collaborative Open Spaces (COS) can greatly contribute to this path. \r\n\r\nA diverse workforce means broader knowledge and varied ideas, which can be translated into increased creativity and problem-solving skills\u2019. The growing diversity that characterises Europe today is a very rich resource, which if well-structured, organized and guided can make the CCIs an even more important path for economic growth, job creation, innovation and inclusion. Within this context, the importance of Collaborative Open Spaces (COS) as catalyzers for integrating more young people with socio-economic under-privileged status is of high importance. COSs are one of the most inclusive and open spaces for young people with creative ideas from all over the globe. \r\n\r\nThe impact on the partner organisations will be a deeper understanding of their target group(s), higher capacity in reaching and communicating with their target groups(s), and access to more knowledge and experience through the resources which will be provided during the project.\r\n\r\nThe impact on the participants will be empowerment, through giving them tools to manage a project, the ability to critically analyze their situation as well as managing solutions and spreading their image of being of an add-value and contributors in Europe instead of being told what that means for the society. \r\n\r\nAnother important aspect is to connect young people/creative makers across national boundaries through the learning activities and project work. This will create a sense of ownership, recognition of similar backgrounds and the issues they are facing, as well as the opportunity to discuss solutions with others in a similar situation. Above this, the participants also get to spread their creative project ideas and solutions to other young people with diverse backgrounds, whom can recognize themselves in the contexts that are presented via the creative initiatives which will be developed by the project's participants.  \r\n\r\nThe project's long term vision is:\r\n\u2022 Benchmarking tools for diversity via collaborative open spaces in order to enhance the creative and integration within CCIs\r\n\u2022 Strategic partnerships and exchange of Good-Practices between organisations and stakeholders from partner countries.\r\n\u2022 Improved interaction between facilitators, industry and policy makers and awareness of the urgency to secure the diversification of open collaborative working spaces within the creative industries on a long-term basis.", "http://www.inplaceofwar.net", null, "erasmus_2017-3-SE02-KA205-001910_2"], ["5JW", "Framework for Innovation Competencies Development and Assessment", "CHAMBERLINK LIMITED", 800753.0, "EU\u2019s Innovation Union Initiative underlines the importance of innovations in all sectors of the economy. For creating new innovations we need individuals that are capable to participate in diverse everyday innovation processes. One main problem is that universities don\u2019t have proper tools to measure the development of the students\u2019 innovation competencies during their studies. Therefore, we don\u2019t actually know which teaching and learning methods are effective. Also companies are lacking tools and knowledge to assess these competencies in various settings: in recruitment processes and internal development activities. Unawareness of innovation competencies causes great economic losses for employers annually. The FINCODA project, with a significant number of universities and innovation-intensive companies from 5 countries, aims at providing solutions for a solid path for forthcoming innovators from university to companies. We shall test new forms of enhancing innovation competencies in university-company cooperation. Real-life learning environments bring added value for all stakeholders and lower the students\u2019 threshold to enter the working life. As a main tangible output of the project we are creating and validating a Software Application tool for innovation competencies assessment. It will be available as an OER. We shall also illustrate that - especially when speaking about innovation competencies \u2013 well-organized and structured behaviour assessment can be at the same time cost-effective, reliable, valid and value adding, compared to traditional written tests.

This project wants to apply the power of football to pursue the goal of generating a climate that is safe, secure, and inclusive for LGBTs.Unmasking the BIG secret proposes an innovative approach to this issue, leveraging on the stature and reach of professional football players. A team of high-profile football players will be formed that speak out in favour of LGBT acceptance in football, dubbed \u2018Heroes of Football.\u2019 The project will enroll an (online) educational game that will unmask the reasons underlying current LGBT issues in football. The game will be released on a high-profile launch day at a major football stadium in Europe. On this day, the Heroes of Football team will play a friendly match and the educational game will be publicly demonstrated, and subsequently made available through all available channels. As a follow-up, a toolkit will be developed that allows for the re-creation of the launch day at other football clubs, both at the professional and at the amateur level, to foster the uptake of the educational game and leave a lasting impression on local footballing communities.
