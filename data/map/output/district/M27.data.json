The potential of PCP is generally recognized; however, no large scale projects have been carried out where several countries join their efforts procurers encounter bottlenecks in the implementation of the PCP concept.<br/>Smart@Fire has two main objectives: the first is to tackle a concrete challenge; the second is to create a commonly agreed PCP approach that can be deployed and duplicated in the EU and formulate answers for the identified bottlenecks.<br/>The project tackles a concrete challenge that has been detected commonly by procurers: how to increase the safety of fire fighters and first responders undertaking fire fighting and civil protection work? Fire fighting remains a perilous with a lot of casualties and deaths; the proposed ICT-solutions available on the market at the moment do not yet provide full satisfaction. This translates clearly the innovation expectations from the procurers' side related to smart monitoring or technological advance in equipment. The solution lays in the development of ICT-solutions in Smart Personal Protective Equipment that might prevent injuries or deaths.<br/>Smart@Fire wants to be a groundbreaking pilot project which will implement a PCP trajectory to solve the stated problem that transcends the EU borders. Additionally the project will prove that PCP holds many advantages for public procurers; will investigate the effects of scale and stimulates the exchange of PCP expertise in order to create a PCP approach that works on a European scale. This should pave the way towards an increased amount of joint PCP initiatives to come.<br/>Finally through tangible results, Smart@Fire would not only seek to achieve safer European citizens and safer firefighters throughout Europe; but develop smarter ICT-solutions for PPE that are transferable in a global market.", 40303.0, 1789555.0, "Smart@Fire", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_105991_954733462"], ["8LJ", "Improvement of the plastic packaging waste chain from a circular economy approach", "Hahn Plastics Ltd", "The European plastic market is not currently aligned with the circular economy. More than 25.8 million tonnes of plastic waste are produced per year in the EU28 being recycled only 29.7%. This represents a clear loose in the plastic market loop (losses of \u20ac10.56bn). Moreover, this goes against the EU legislation on waste (high environmental impact; 23.8 Mt of CO2). \nLow recycling rates of plastic are mainly due to the situation of packaging waste (i.e. main plastic waste fraction), since it is mainly domestic residue and consequently the quality of the material collected depends on the system of segregation available and the environmental awareness of citizens.\n\nPlastiCircle aims to develop and implement a holistic process to increase recycling rates of packaging waste in Europe. This will allow to reprocess again plastic waste in the same value chain (i.e. Circular economy; closure of plastic loop). This process is based on four axes: collection (to increase quantity of packaging collected), transport (to reduce costs of recovered plastic), sorting (to increase quality of recovered plastic), and valorization in value-added products (i.e. foam boards, automotive parts like engine covers/bumpers/dashboards, bituminous roofing membranes, garbage bags, asphalt sheets/roofing felts and urban furniture like fences/benches/protection walls). \n\nThe target is to increase collection from 81.7% to 87% and valorization in a 9.8%. The implementation of PlastiCircle approach in Europe have the potential to increase collected plastic in 861,250t (reaching 14.14 Mt) and valorization in 1.59Mt. The valorization of this new material, represents a market value of \u20ac2.86bn-\u20ac7.95bn. Taking into account current figures of the plastic sector (turnover \u20ac350bn, 62,000 companies, 1.45M employees), this could imply creation of 500-1400 new companies and the generation of 11,900-33,000 new jobs in the medium to long term if PlastiCircle approach is extended in a EU level.", 156311.0, 7583191.0, "PlastiCircle", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210517_917479448"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["5FJ", "SALFORD CITY COUNCIL", 615121.0, "Disaster prevention and preparedness within the Union (23.03.01.01)", "fts_2016_26082", 2016], ["8LJ", "HAHN PLASTICS LTD", 155964.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_3695", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "M27"}
