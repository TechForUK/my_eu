Building on a proven and unique formula that has evolved and developed during the BISYOC charity\u2019s 14-year history, the concept combines cultural exchange with the medium of participating in a large symphony orchestra to bring about a wide range of benefits to participants. The 2014 exchange includes young people from 10 countries throughout the length and breadth of Europe; from Norway in the north to Malta in the south; from Portugal in the west to Romania in the east. \r\n\r\n70 participants, from a range of socio-economic, educational and cultural backgrounds, but united by their high level of skill in music, will live and work together for 11 days and nights in Ludlow, England, interacting with the local community as well as with one another. The medium of the working symphony orchestra has proved itself as a special tool for individual and collective development, representing as it does a model of cooperation towards achieving a common goal. Guided by highly-qualified experts, participants will intensively study challenging orchestral repertoire and prepare public performances. At the same time, daily inter-cultural activities will combine with the musical activity to create an environment where cultural interaction quickly becomes the norm and any pre-existing barriers or prejudices are broken down. The added dimension in 2014 will be to participate in cultural events commemorating the centenary of World War One, bringing historical relevance to the project. A pan-European symphony orchestra is arguably symbolic of the diverse but cohesive and peaceful Europe in which we all now live \u2013 showing just how far Europe has progressed in a century.\r\n\r\nIn line with the objectives of Erasmus Plus, BISYOC\u2019s ultimate objectives in 2014 are to deepen the impact of the exchange to reach beyond the immediately obvious musical and social transformations that usually take place during the 11-day period of activity. We will aim to stimulate the participants to think at a deeper level, by helping them to recognise the transferable skills and competences they are developing by taking part, and to recognise the ways that their attitudes and viewpoints are broadening. This is in the hope that they become better citizens of the world, equipped with better tools to find employment, with better tools to interact with their foreign counterparts, and with an increased motivation to engage in future learning. \r\n\r\nWe also aim to strengthen the impact of BISYOC on the local community in which the exchange is hosted in a tangible way, by involving a local choir in both the musical and inter-cultural activities.

They are  the MFR of Seyssel, Bonne, Th\u00f4nes  (CFMM ), Cruseilles les Droni\u00e8res, Sallanches in the Haute-Savoie region, Eyzin-Pinet and Chatte in the Isere region; Chessy- les mines, L\u2019Arbresle, Saint Laurent de Chamousset in the Rh\u00f4ne region, Montbrison in the Loire region and Montluel in the Ain region.  Since 2004, this project has consecutively been the twelfth to be carried out and coordinated by the regional federation and is the most important further to a voluntarist policy to promote the european mobility that has been implemented for over ten years. In a context where the inward-looking attitude keeps increasing, the opening onto the world and towards others, interculturality, the strengthening of the professional, linguistic and personal skills constitute the aims of this project.\r\nAlthough every MFR has specifically defined its own aims, common objectives were upstream determined by the steering committee. They concern:\r\n-Significant improvements in language learning.\r\n-The strengthening of integration and adaptation capacities thanks to immersion work in a professional environment.\r\n-The development of professional skills specific to the enterprise, to the professional system of reference through carrying out activities determined beforehand by the partners.\r\n-The discovery of a country of the European Union and its culture.\r\n-The accession to autonomy and self-confidence, the capacity to take care of oneself and the development of adaptability.\r\n-Education in the opening-up to the world and towards others. Far from being innate, openness towards others requires a daily education that reaches its climax during the stay. Young people have a lot of prejudice, their judgment towards foreigners is often negative. Experience in immersion and meetings constitute an excellent means to perceive otherness that, despite differences, reveals more convergence and common grounds.\r\nThe ambition of this project is to enable 351 students in vocational or technical high school to enjoy a three-week stay in a European country selected by their MFR. They are in fifth, sixth or final year of high school with the following options: Services to people and territories, Business studies, Horticultural production, technicians , sale in pet shop, management, administration, landscaping, farm management. They are between 16 and 20 years old, most of them coming from a rural background, they think of living and working in a rural environment. They have little or no experience of mobility abroad, consequently we are convinced that this stay will benefit them and their future employability. In the sectors: Service and Business, the proportion of female students is very important, it is the opposite in the other sectors.\r\nIn methodological terms, project activities are managed by the promoter and the MFR involved and distributed between them. The promoter is in charge of promotion, of administrative and financial management, of the follow-up and technical support, of the quality control of the project and its dissemination. The steering committee made up of the 3 official representatives appointed by the promoter, of the director of the MFR regional federation ,of the directors of every MFR and the technical committee made up of the 3 representatives and of every project leader, plan and supervise all project stages. To do that, numerous meetings are planned.\r\nThen, after appointing a project leader,  every  MFR involved is responsible for preparing, informing students and their families, organizing the  stays,  for the follow-up and on-the-spot support, for determining training course work and the restitution work required, for the exploitation and valuation of the acquired skills and for the dissemination of the results. All this should be achieved in accordance with the schedule of conditions determined by the promoter and the steering committee.\r\nIn the short or middle term, the results and impacts expected concern the widening of the beneficiaries\u2019 professional skills, improvement in linguistic understanding, above all orally, the awareness of the necessity to practise  another language than theirs so as to be able to exchange and communicate in any circumstances, personal development, a synonym of self- confidence and autonomy.\r\nIn the long term, the aim is the opening onto Europe, the awareness that we are all European citizens with rights and duties as well, the desire to travel and grow rich of the interculturality that ennobles every individual.  Above all the aim is to enhance the employability of every beneficiary.", "http://john.goowin1@btconnect.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-013974_10"], ["2AF", "BISYOC EXCHANGE 2016", "BISYOC", 40253.0, "BISYOC 2016 is an Intercultural Youth Music Exchange.
