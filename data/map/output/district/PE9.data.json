It will include three short downloadable illustrated guides on media production outdoors, food production and responsible entrepreneurship.  It will also include details and results of an international media award scheme as well as profiles of young media producers, presenters and entrepreneurs, with examples of their films, podcasts, blogs, e-marketing and journalistic articles.  Additionally we will run two five-day residential training courses in the UK and Spain each for 9 young people (3 from each of the three partner countries) based on the topics of the three online guides, with pre- and post- course webinars and Skype chats.\r\n\r\nYOOF will help young people to gain experience and develop skills related to media and digital technologies in the context of food production boosting their employability especially in rural areas.  It can also enable food enterprises to develop their e-marketing and agrotourism. Many young people are interested in being healthy consumers of food produced with minimum environmental impact, as well as living a sustainable lifestyle. So YOOF also focuses on sustainability in terms of lifestyle, particularly work-life balance, working conditions and food consumption and production.  In conclusion YOOF will make an innovative contribution to rural entrepreneurship education for youth especially about filmmaking, media reporting/journalism/e-marketing and sustainable  food production and processing.", "http://susted.blogspot.co.uk", "Susted", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA205-035756_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1QS", "PERSONAL STRENGTHS (UK) LTD*", 4996.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_43629", 2016]]}}, "outwardCode": "PE9"}
