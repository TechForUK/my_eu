Nacelles and pylons will be included to accommodate two turbofan simulators which are to be supplied by DNW/ONERA.  A set of wings will be produced which will have removable leading edges and trailing edge flaps. This will allow a wide range of configurations to be investigated, including clean, take-off, landing and airbrakes on/off.  A modular empennage will also be produced. These items will be designed to interface with the remainder of the model which will be provided by a partner independent of this CFP.  The resultant model will be tested in a low speed wind tunnel at atmospheric pressure to investigate two topics. Firstly, the effectiveness of the empennage in shielding engine noise, and secondly the assessment of wing aerodynamic efficiency together with low speed take-off and landing performance and handling qualities. A large number of steady and unsteady probes will be installed in the model. Kulites \u00ae will be mounted in the thin nacelle and empennage.  These will be supplemented by gauges on the empennage to measure loads.\n\nAircraft Research Association (ARA) proposes to apply its extensive experience in wind tunnel model design and manufacture.  ARA will lead the programme of work with manufacturing support provided by Future Advanced Manufacturing Ltd (FAM).  ARA and FAM have worked closely on many wind tunnel model programmes, producing high quality models to exacting tolerances and demanding timescales. Over many years, ARA and FAM have established reliable working practices, innovative technical solutions to challenging requirements and effective project control and management processes. ARA and FAM will apply this expertise to the requirements of this new call to ensure that all aspects of the model are achieved in the required timescale and budget.\n.'", 239292.0, 1076818.0, "LOSPA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.futuream.com", null, "fp7_104825_983304424"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9JW", "Erasmus+, Realgymnasiet Nyk\u00f6ping", "Gloucestershire Animal Welfare Association & Cheltenham Animal Shelter", 23812.0, "Realgymnasiet Nyk\u00f6ping has got experiences of other projects such as Leonardo da Vinci and has had very positive outcomes revolving students\u2019 knowledge development.\r\nThe object for this project is to enhance the employability for our students after graduation by letting students participate in work experience abroad.\r\nThrough a work experience the participant gets an opportunity to develop language skills, cultural awareness, references and global field skills. The project also aims to develop knowledge for students and staff to develop knowledge concerning global work that has been raised in the curriculum for higher education and goals to attain in the Natural Resources Programme. Through our experience we know that projects such as these students do develop their ability to discuss subjects from different view points. This will help the students in making a positive progress in their studies.\r\nThe duration for this application is two years. Realgymnasiet has four different courses, these are; animal care, horse care, dog training and nature guide/tourism. This project would give 12 students and one accompanying person, per year, the possibility to go abroad in year 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe project will be run by personnel at school who will designate a coordinator in charge.

Our structure is located in the heart of a political district of the city. One of the major tasks of our youth center is to enable our public to overcome the social handicaps linked to our environment through leisure activities. In order to do this, the Youth Projects Department, financed in part by the Departmental Social Assistance for Children, provides support for adolescents from vulnerable neighborhoods, dropping out of school or in social or integration difficulties, around the concept Project, with non-formal education as a tool.\r\nMoreover, we also have as mission as an actor of popular education, to offer our publics key to understanding the world. We therefore need to make young people understand the opportunities and importance of European integration in their daily lives.\r\nThis project is also part of a particular context marked by a lack of knowledge of the European Union and the values of defends and a rise in euroscepticism and withdrawal.\r\nWe see that the young people we work with on a daily basis are not insensitive to these arguments.\r\nAfter a first visit to Italy, a few days in Lisbon and a visit to San Sebastian (European Capital of Culture in 2016), the dynamic was born.\r\nIn 2017, a stay will be organized in England during the holidays of April, which will be financed by the youth projects scheme 64.\r\nIn order to go further in this discovery, these young people wish to organize a European exchange based on combating stereotypes, promoting our cultural diversity and living together. Indeed, the impact of the rise of radicalization in our society is a brake on living together. This is why these young people wish that through this Melting pot, we will bring to light another way of seeing Europe.\r\nThis stay will be built using inclusive and cooperative games in order to allow each participant to find his place in this group. The Youthpass will also allow them to discover what non-formal education has for all of us and how to value it. The challenge is for these young people to be part of a process of action and take the means put at their disposal by the European Union to extend this exchange.\r\nTo build this project, we ask each group to come up with a video presenting the stereotypes we have towards each other. The idea is that at the end of this exchange a new video is realized around what looks like us.\r\nWe also wish to rely on the discovery of our respective gastronomies which can be a good pretext at convivial moments and the idea of doing together.\r\nThrough sporting activities we want to bring these teenagers to surpass themselves, to become supportive and to help each other.\r\nThus this project helps to develop living together through a European identity.\r\nThat is why, since last year, our structure has chosen to guide a part of youth activities towards the discovery of Europe. Based on a micro-pavement made by teenagers about simple questions about the functioning of this European union, we found that both young people and adults did not know how many countries constitute the European Union, Its history and even less its functioning.\r\nFollowing this experience, young people gathered to set up a program of activities around the discovery of Europe.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-2-FR02-KA105-013069_1"], ["3AT", "W\u0142\u0105cz@nie przez TIK@nie - nowoczesne technologie informacyjno-komunikacyjne TIK w szkole specjalnej dla uczni\u00f3w z niepe\u0142nosprawno\u015bci\u0105 intelektualn\u0105 i sprz\u0119\u017con\u0105 szans\u0105 na inkluzj\u0119 niepe\u0142nosprawnych- innowacyjna edukacja i rewalidacja", "Bettridge", 119481.0, "Strategic partnership \u2013 cooperation between schools will be held between four special schools from different European countries: Poland, Great Britain, The Netherlands and  Malta.

Teachers from these schools and children with profound and multiple learning disabilities  will be the direct participants of the Project. The indirect beneficiaries will be the families of the children, teachers from the participating countries, students, academic teachers, and the employees of psychological and educational dispensaries. The participating schools will be exchanging good practice in terms of Information Communication Technology (ICT), especially   innovative  solutions in the field of ICT. Schools will be working on the implementation of the innovative  projects in everyday educational practice with disabled children, in order to achieve better results, and to  work more effectively  with special needs children, who are specially exposed  to discrimination and  societal exclusion.\r\nGeneral aims:\r\n- Exchanging ideas in terms of Information Communication Technology ( ICT ) tools, used by teachers in educational  process, with severely disabled children and children with multiple disabilities as well as comprehensive implementation of organizational  and methodological solutions  in partner schools, participating in the project, in order to achieve  permanent effects  and to  show another dimension of education.\r\nOther aims: \r\n- Upgrading  teachers\u2019  knowledge of how to use modern Information and Communication Technology  as an important tool in inclusive  education, to level up educational chances and societal inclusion of disabled children. \r\n- Supporting  classical teaching  methods  by digital methods \u2013 elaborating  innovative teaching tools: Omnidu, smart boards, multimedia projectors, OptiMusic, tablets, RehabKinect,  interactive carpet, Android applications, professional software, adaptation of assistive technology tools, implementing  new ideas, innovations which leads to long terms solutions  and improvement of  the quality of teaching.\r\n- Improving language competences and increasing teachers\u2019 mobility.\r\n- Reducing  \u201cdigital hole\u201d. \r\nSpecific activities  will include  mutual international trainings and exchanging good practice, in terms of using ICT equipment  to support the education of disabled children. After completing the trainings, the participating teachers are going to  instruct other teachers from their schools, how to use ICT in educational process. The teachers will learn about the innovative  hi-tech equipment and software like OptiMusik, Omnidu, Orion Tube, RehabKinect, M\u00f3wik, interactive carpet and adaptation of assistive technology tools. The other  aim  of this Project is to create   a  library of open educational resources, which includes lessons scripts, using ICT technology in education and revalidation process with disabled children, didactical  resources  in teaching  to be used by teachers, instructional videos to be used by pupils, teachers and parents. The library of open educational resources will be developed by all participants of the Project, teachers from Poland,  The Netherlands, Malta and Great Britain. The aim of this library of open educational resources is to encourage  and  facilitate teachers  to use ICT technology in everyday work, and to be a methodological support  to them. This library of open educational resources will be presented  during local conferences which will be   organized  in partner schools,  and also during the main summarizing  conference in June 2020 in SOSW Nr3 in Krakow. During the conference we will  show  examples of  the positive influence of  ICT on education, therapy and inclusion of disabled pupils.  We will talk about  software  and hardware, applications, educational exercises, which could be used in educational process of disabled  children, children with  Autism as well as physically disabled children. All participants will receive the materials which will also be available  on school websites, e Twining platform, Orion Tube, School Education Geteway, Erasmus+ platform. In the longer terms such activities  will become an essential part of the process of building open attitudes  towards people with disabilities, building a new quality of special education, creating concepts and strategies for inclusive education.
