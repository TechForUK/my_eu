The proposal builds on Universe Awareness (UNAWE), a unique, innovative and proven programme for children aged 4 to 10 years. It will exploit the achievements of European (EU) and South African (SA) space sciences to inspire, excite and stimulate young children, when their curiosity is high and their value systems are being formed. Specifically, EU-UNAWE will: - Train and empower primary school teachers in 6 countries to include astronomy and space topics in the classroom. - Develop and translate hands-on material, where appropriate emphasising EU and SA science and technology. - Provide a network for exchange of expertise and material between educators - Lay the groundwork for expansion of the programme throughout the EU, Associated Countries and ICP Countries. - Act as a showcase for EU and SA astronomy/space and related technologies, by disseminating the products among very young children, their teachers and their families. - Use astronomy/space products to stimulate awareness and strengthen public support for EU and SA space science research and technology. - Stimulate the next generation of EU and SA engineers and scientists, particularly girls. - Contribute to the integration of disadvantaged communities in participating countries. - Strengthen collaboration between EU and SA over mutually beneficial scientific, technological, educational and social topics. - Provide significant added value for Europe\u2019s expenditure on astronomy and space sciences for a modest incremental cost.

EU-UNAWE national project managers (NPMs) in each of the six participating countries are developing educational materials and running workshops. Together, they provide primary school educators with ideas, resources and confidence to bring astronomy and space science into their classrooms.\n\nMany events for children have been held and the EU-UNAWE International Office has organised an astronomy news service for kids called Space Scoop. It has already published about 50 stories based on press releases from major astronomical observatories and astronomy organisations that have been translated into 14 languages. Particular emphasis has been given to targeting girls and encouraging them to take up careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\nEU-UNAWE is using the wonders of the Universe to inspire young children all over the world, encourage a lifelong interest in science and technology, and foster a feeling of international community.

The 'European planetology network' (http://www.europlanet-eu.org/ (EUROPLANET)) was the initiative of European scientists working on the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan, its largest moon.\n\nIn its initial phase, EUROPLANET helped researchers define common science goals and exchange ideas as well as personnel. From January 2009 it entered a new, more ambitious phase where access was provided to the world's largest databank in planetary science.\n\nIn a subsequent phase, under the project 'European planetology network research infrastructure' (http://www.europlanet-ri.eu/ (EUROPLANET\u00a0RI)), 27 research institutes and universities joined forces. They brought together data sets from a wide variety of space missions and the output of theoretical models to build a virtual observatory with an unprecedented view of the entire solar system.\n\nExtensive efforts were also devoted to raising the profile of European planetary science through national and international media. Underpinned by a network of key contact points in each European country, EUROPLANET\u00a0RI provided a plethora of information on Europe's involvement in planetary science to policymakers, the industry and the public.\n\nDuring the European Planetary Science Congress (EPSC), organised once a year, European scientists had the opportunity to get together with their international peers for a productive exchange of scientific results. The EUROPLANET\u00a0RI outreach activities also brought researchers' excitement to European citizens.\n\nThese activities also assisted experienced researchers to engage in dialogue with the public and, more importantly, a younger generation that needs encouragement to pursue a career in science.

They got a good feedback about their application, so they decided to make the youth exchange real. They had similar ideas about the youth exchange, so it was easy decide about it.\r\n \r\nWith this youth exchange we hope to gain international cooperation of the youngsters. Also important is to get to know about others culture and meeting new people, learn about education in each otherscountries, how young people are heard/acknowledged in each others countries and to recognise ones own learning through self assesment. \r\n \r\nParticipating youngsters will learn and improve their design, execute introduction and leading skills. They will also learn to plan, execute and estimate workshops. Youngsters will expand their mobility inside the EU. They will meet new people from another country, and keep in touch with them. They will also get skills, knowledge and possibilities, what they can share with their own local community. Youngsters with different backgrounds will learn about each other\u2019s cultures, countries, historical places and sports. They will improve their English skills and might learn each other\u2019s languages.

Participants from Finland will be 20 youngsters and 3 youth leaders.\r\n \r\nIn our youth exchange the Northern Irish group comes to Finland. Northern Irish will come to live in summer camp Asinsaari which is owned by the city of Lappeenranta. We have planned activity for every day, but Northern Irish will plan activity for some day\u2019s themes, for example on the day when we have a open festival for everyone, they will bring out their own dance culture and show us their dances. In this way both groups learn about each other\u2019s cultures. We have planned to cook together too, on that day we will bring out food culture from both countries. We also have planned sport, dance, nature and to explore the city days. We will have activities focusing on youth councils and how to make a change in your community. Many evenings there will be evening campfire.\r\n \r\nOur methods are based on that that we do a lot of teamwork with the other participants. We will also do things individually, then we will estimate ourselves in other words we will do self-evaluation for example: What do I want from this youth exchange? What do I want to learn? What could prevent me from learning? etc. And we always have youth leaders, who can advise us and help us. However we will try do as much as possible ourselves, because this is our youth exchange.\r\n \r\nWe hope that this youth exchange only affects the participants in positive way, in other words we hope that they get new and unforgettable experiences and good friends who they can keep in touch with. The participants will benefit about the change, because they will learn to use their knowledge of languages better, which makes possible them to be multilingual. This helps if they want have an international job, where you need to be multilingual. The participants will learn how to communicate with others more skillfully with new people. They will benefit also about that that they will see new country where they maybe have never visited and will learn about new cultures and about different ways.

Our town will surely pay attention to our youth council more, also trust our organization and will want to hear more about our opinions. The local community will surely get pleasant memories, which they can recall cheerfully sometimes later.

They had previously completed exchanges several years with Brownlow Area Youth Project in Craigavon, which is a controlled youth centre within SELB Youth Service.  The feedback was so positive from Craigavon that they contacted the group in Bavaria and established a new link.

There will be alot of team building including using outdoor education as we are hosting first.  \r\nOur youth will introduce the group to our experiences of growing up in a divided society and living with the legacy of the conflict.  There will be political tours, visits to educational venues such as Titanic Centre and Crumlin Road Jail.  We will also explore democracy with visits and talks with our local council and our government buildings in Belfast.  Our identity is hugely tied into our sports and music and this will be explored alongside workshops reviewing our commonalities with the Bavarian group and experiences of racism and sectarianism in both countries.

A VLE will give us the perfect safe environment to share, exhibit and exchange information and ideas. We will provide opportunities for our staff to travel and visit other educational settings where they will have the opportunity to not only experience school life in another setting but also the culture and traditions of that country. They will explore similarities and differences between education systems, meet with staff and exchange ideas and solutions to the problems we all face on a day to day basis, E safety and lack of resources especially lack of playground space.  We will provide opportunities for staff to develop their own personal skills and competencies working alongside specialists in the field of ICT in the educational setting. Staff will have the opportunity to broaden their horizons through travel, they will experience the culture and traditions of other nationalities.

We very much wish to enhance both the European awareness of our staff and pupils and to have a completely motivated and up skilled staff.  We envisage a total of 17 staff members, 8 teaching and 9 non-teaching, availing of the training opportunities provided by the selected course facilitators.  All staff will augment their Europasses accumulated from previous itineraries.  The rationale behind the project is to enhance the competences of both teaching and non-teaching staff and ultimately to disseminate good practice back in school.  Consequently we will up skill all participants to pick up contemporary methodologies and augment both classroom experiences and learning opportunities for all our children.  We also wish to improve the European dimension of St Malachy's Primary School through greater language acquisition opportunities and increasing European awareness.\r\n\r\nWith the evolution of technology it is now possible for us to have the whole of Europe at the touch of a button in our classrooms. The possibilities are endless, blogging, webinairs, electronic lessons all things that we could only imagine 5 years ago but are now embracing as part of our normal day to day teaching. What next then? Simple a Virtual Learning Environment a VLE, a place to store, access from anywhere, and share the bank of wonderful resources we have built up and are continuing to build through co-operating in projects with our European partners.\r\n\r\nThis dream can easily become a reality as we have the enthusiasm and are ready for the challenge but we need funding to help us achieve this. Funding will allow us to access the expertise of people working in this field, this will enable us to create a tailor made resource which meets the needs of our school. We can train staff, pupils and parents in its use and maintenance and give them access and the support to develop areas within where they can have autonomy over their learning.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work alongside some of our European School Comenius partners, and to develop new partnerships with school personnel we engaged with during our previous Erasmus+ KA1 project to develop resources to share for the mutual benefit of our pupils, in languages,  the people and the places in which we live.

The added value of the project consists in the transnational character facilitating the exchange of experiences and good practices at European level in order to promote learning through outdoor and non-formal activities.The project will encourage higher thinking. Students will be placed in new educational situations where knowledge acquisition is not enough; they will have to apply knowledge in new constructions. This will be reinforced by the continuous international exchange. The frequent use of 21st Century Skills will encourage students to make their own educational materials while participating in learning/teaching/training activities. This kind of partnership will lead the development of the spirit of active citizenship to all participants.In the previous section we indicated many teachers lack the ability to customized education and applying 21st Century Skills. To tackle this assumption, this project provides training courses (workshops), good practice, Implementation conversations (meetings, website) and working together, will have a stimulating effect and reduce fears. Through this approach, we create a group where it is always possible and safe, asking for help. Education is teamwork at its best.Participants from Greece, Spain, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have joined forces to pursue three objectives:   1) Cross curricular approach by making use of   2) 21st Century Skills, and   3) Strengthening the European dimension in our education.Although the schools are from totally different educational cultures, they are united in pursuing these objectives, because they should do so in accordance with the multi-annual policies and the requirements of the (national) curriculum. The five topics are:     1. Culture; connectedness in diversity     2. History; the sea: driving force behind the development of civilization     3. Keeping healthy; despite 21st century temptations.     4. Ecology: national problems require European solution     5. Keeping Safe; 21st Century threats overpoweredThe topics will be conducted according to a set pattern and by making use of various subjects in a cross-curricular approach, using 21st Century Skills.Emphasis is put on: Creativity - Critical thinking - Problem solving skills - Communication - Cooperation - Digital literacy - Social and cultural skills and Self-regulation.In the topics there will be established moments in which children have to share results and experiences with their colleagues abroad. (Video conferencing / traveling abroad)For both teachers and students, the heart of the project will be the Learning / Teaching / Training Activities. By making use of the expertise available among partners, supplemented by seminars, workshops and class visits and all brought together in (international) conversations / meetings; the educational skills and knowledge of teachers as well as the effectiveness of the learning process will increase.The educational website and e Twinning, provide teachers reflection and help (chat / video). Students will be involved in two mobilities. Their tasks are:1) Representation: presentation of school / country, Puppet, poster etc.2) Cooperate: in international groups in various activities, visits and experiments, concerning the topic3) Create: a booklet about the topic (part of the E-magazine)4) Collect: information about the country (officially and from their point of view \u2013 photo, video) 5) Keeping a diary6) Experience the culture and history.The last three tasks are the basis for a comprehensive briefing for parents and classmates.The younger students will carried out a second group of activities called: PUPPETS WITH A MISSION, based on the same three main objectives of the project.A Puppet represents a topic. Holland chose Kermit, because our topic is water. Kermit travels on a fixed schedule. In his suitcase a number of tasks that must be carried out by the host school. (Music, dance, language, history, experimentation, etc. all related to water) In addition, Kermit will teach host school children something about our country.His diary, allows Dutch children to see what Kermit has experienced. Halfway there is Skype contact with the host school. All project activities will result in:1) rewriting and updating of multi-year policies and curriculum2) adjusting the documents that stipulate the personal development (Knowledge, educational skills, improvements) teachers3) a number of end products that will serve as a database for the years following the closing of the project.
