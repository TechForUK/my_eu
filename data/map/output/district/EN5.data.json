Proteome targets will be focused on five categories of inter-related human proteins involved in signal transduction, cell regulation and cancer, namely protein kinases, SH2 domain-containing proteins, protein tyrosine phosphatases, proteins somatically mutated in cancers and candidate cancer biomarkers. Binders to about 1000 protein targets will be made over the course of the programme. A high throughput, coordinated production pipeline for antigens and binders will be established. Target antigens will be expressed in three forms, as folded full-length proteins or domains, as large peptide fragments (PrESTs) based on low homology to other human proteins and as small peptides, in some cases phosphorylated. Binder types to be generated include affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant antibody fragments and non-immunoglobulin scaffolds. An important aspect will be the development of highly efficient \u2018next generation\u2019 recombinant selection methods, based on phage, cell and ribosome display, capable of producing high quality binders at greater throughput and lower cost than hitherto.

One of the important steps is to target proteins through systematic generation of binders.\n\nBy generating the reagents that bind proteins, the http://www.affinomics.org (AFFINOMICS) project aims to advance methodologies for proteome-related analysis of cell signalling and cancer intervention. This 5-year project, involving 20 participants from 8 EU countries, initiated the proteome-wide binder collection. The ultimate goal is to create an efficient pipeline for target (antigen) and immunological binder production, validation and quality control.\n\nAFFINOMICS focuses on characterisation of proteins involved in signal transduction pathways in normal and cancer cells, where the current need for specific, quality binders is especially great. Thus, proteins controlling the homeostasis of protein phosphorylation (protein kinases, SH2 domain-containing proteins and tyrosine phosphatases) as well as cancer biomarkers are of particular interest.\n\nAs the project draws to a close after four years, the partners have produced close to 500 full-length proteins and protein domains. Protein antigens include protein phosphatases, protein kinases, nine metabolic enzymes, ubiquitin pathway enzymes and cancer biomarkers. Specific binders contained over 1\u00a0000 rabbit, mouse and rat monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, nanobodies and scaffolds. The characterisation of the generated binders includes affinity control and a variety of protein microarrays. In addition, the methods for improved throughput of recombinant binders by ribosome and phage display have been developed.\n\nAll novel protein and binder information is included in the project database portal http://www.proteinbinders.org (Protein Binders), with a current listing of 1\u00a0400 target proteins.

So it is essential to provide young people  entering the labour market with practical skills and soft skills, to tackle unemployment, to allow companies to have adequate labor force, and, finally, to strengthen the productive capacity of territories. So, the objective of the project is to better qualify local human resources through the carrying out of international mobilities, focusing on the acquisition of technical and transversal skills required by the fashion industry, in order to make the professional profile of the participants more competitive on the labour market, contributing to increase their employability and to takle the phenomenon of massive migration of young people from the areas of origin. Carrying out a traineeship in European companies operating in the fashion industry will enable participants to integrate theoretical studies with practical activities, according to the philosophy of \"learning by doing\". During the traineeship they will be constantly monitored and supported by tutors who will assess their progress, and- at the end of the experience- the learning outcomes achieved, releasing the appropriate certifications.The experience will contribute to achieving the following results in the participants:- Improvement of practical and operative skills in the fashion sector and consolidation of technical and professional knowledge- Improvement of language competences, including the sectorial language of the fashion industry- Knowledge of different labor markets and other economies, new methodologies and practices in the fashion sector- Familiarization with social and cultural contexts of other EU countries, and strenghtening of European citizenship- Development of transversal communication, organizational and problem solving competences- Acquisition of  national and European certification expendable in the labor market- Upgrading and integration of the CV with new competences and experiences- Opportunities for recognition of competences acquired abroad (ECVET)- Improvement of the capacity of identification and evaluation of employment opportunities in the labor marketThe project will have a positive impact on the members of the Consortium, in terms of: capacity building of the organization and management of international activities with local and foreign partners; strengthening of strategies for internationalization and development, introduction of transnational mobility activities as \"systemic\"; updating of curricula to the needs of the area and the world of work.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects.

Many national and international surveys have demonstrated consumers' generally low level of understanding of financial matters and of basic economics, at a time when financial system and products are becoming more complex and sophisticated, making them difficult to understand. Few adults have engaged in learning about finance because of a lack of capacity of adult training providers to offer such provision including the lack of competent teachers in the subject. \r\n\r\nThere is growing interest in financial education and the European Commission is supporting the development of capacity to offer it. Its profile has been increasing and it now features very prominently in some state education systems. It is now part of the school curriculum in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together providers of adult learning from different educational sectors to form  a strategic partnership, to strengthen the capacity of institutions to deliver financial education, enhance the professional development of staff and develop innovative approaches to learning including the use of digital technology to improve the overall quality of the provision and stimulate demand for financial education.\r\n\r\nWithin this broad aim the key objectives are to:\r\n1. Evaluate current approaches and practices in teaching financial education\r\n2. Determine the level of finance competence in finance among teachers \r\n3. Improve the pedagogical and financial competence of teachers\r\n4. Equip teachers with new tools to deliver financial education\r\n5. Stimulate demand for learning and increase the take-up of financial training\r\n6. Improve the accessibility and quality of training in personal finance\r\n7. Mobilise social capital to help promote financial education\r\n8. Provide guidance to organisations wanting to develop capacity to deliver financial education\r\n\r\nThese objectives will be achieved through a number of complementary and interrelated activities. These include research on strategies and plans to promote financial education, a needs analysis in order to identify institutional needs and the specific needs of financial education teachers, identifying the  needed by teachers to deliver financial education effectively and developing a competency framework and training course for teachers, developing a financial capability framework and training modules for adult learners,  developing learning materials in which functional and digital skills are embedded  and a toolkit for organisations and teachers delivering financial education.\r\n\r\nThe project targets two main groups, teachers of adults and learners. The teachers include those currently deliver, as well as who do not, but wish to develop the competences to do so. The adults are those in the community with few or no formal qualifications, especially the unemployed, migrants and minority groups, older adults, in or out of learning. The project will target 15 teachers directly 120 adults across the partnership. \r\n\r\nThe main results of the project will be a toolkit for organisations and teachers delivering financial education  containing a financial competency framework and course teachers, a financial capability framework and training modules for adults, learning materials and sample session plans, a website with the learning materials available as Open Education Resource, and a technical paper  providing a comparative analysis of policies, strategies and initiates to promote financial education in the participating countries.\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that participating institutions will have sustainable capacity to deliver financial education, including competent teachers and learning resources that will improve the quality of the provision and stimulate the demand for learning. It is expected that other local and regional providers will be sufficiently impressed by outcomes of the project and decide to build similar capacity and offer financial training in their institution, and engage with European partnership working. \r\nThe project\u2019s legacy will be the mainstreaming of financial education in adult education provision matched by increased demand for learning about personal finance and a more financially literate population.", "http://www.barnetsouthgate.ac.uk", "Global Learning & Skills Partnership", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA204-013728_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EN5"}
