At the same time public funding enabled the community to become more organised on both the research (EURON) and the industrial (EUROP) side and to develop the currently valid Strategic Research Agenda (SRA).Very recently EURON and EUROP decided to combine their portfolio of activities and member base within a new non-profit organisation, euRobotics AISBL, which intends to engage in a contractual Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with the European Commission (EC). The main players behind this success story have joined in this project to address the most important challenges for the coming three to five years:- Professional coordination of technology roadmapping and implementation of innovation activities- Fostering collaboration among all stakeholders of European robotics- Promoting European roboticsThis project's ambition is to create sustainable solutions for these challenges, building on the successful instruments the robotics community has already experimented with. These instruments have not yet fully achieved the required goals, partly because of a lack of dedicated, professional support and partly because the challenges have changed as a consequence of the higher ambitions and the larger set of stakeholders to be involved. This will change with the recent founding of euRobotics AISBL and the commitment of both industrial and academic stakeholders to more closely and formally cooperate, but especially through the PPP with the EC. The following activities are planned engaging the whole community:- Robotics roadmap coordination- Robotics PPP preparation and ramp-up- Facilitating robotics innovation- Robotics networking- Dissemination and outreachThese core activities will defragment the community and construct a European robotics industry with sufficient identity and presence to create world leadership in terms of both strategic capability and economic impact.", 190963.0, 2546479.0, "RockEU", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111361_951442737"], ["9BG", "Robotics Coordination Action for Europe Two", "Itechnic Ltd", "The FP7 coordination action RockEU has been extremely successful in building a strong European robotics community, leading to the creation of euRobotics aisbl - the private partner of the SPARC PPP and development of the Strategic Research Agenda and the Multi-Annual Roadmap, which are the main guidelines for shaping European robotics R&D&I.\n \nRockEU2 builds on and extends this successful community integration by providing analysis of innovation and skills and by developing major outreach activities. This extension is achieved by intensifying and strengthening collaboration within the community and by taking a leading role in the development of strategy. This includes activities in market observation, technology watch, innovation support, analysis of funded proposals, regulations assessment, and standardisation support.\n\nRockEU2 aims to Intensifying cooperation with international funding agencies (e.g. for joint calls), policy makers, and end-users as key enablers in the R&D&I process that contribute to the outreach and innovation themes. \n\nOutreach to the cognitive science community is another key part of this proposal. Improving the uptake of cognitive science\u2019s results by the robotics community is an important target, leading to more innovative robotics products and applications, boosting innovation.\n\nIntegration of activities started by the FP7-funded CAs euRathlon and RoCKIn on using robot competitions to foster research and innovation has great potential for improved public awareness of European robotics. Participation in robot competitions is attractive for young researchers and develops excellent engineering skills. The impact of robot competitions both for public awareness as well as for industry will be analysed and its results will influence the roadmap for future European robot competitions and outreach campaigns.\n\nThe consortium consists of partners playing key roles in their respective communities and contributing unique competences to the consortium", 118639.0, 2137173.0, "RockEU2", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199873_951442737"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0RB", "Internationalizing my curriculum vitae", "MAC Hotels Ltd", 123670.0, "470 pupils are taught by 52 teachers at HLW St. Veit  an der Glan in southern Austria.
