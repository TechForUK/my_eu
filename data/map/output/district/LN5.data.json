In OPTIMISC also a large number of genotypes were screened for various stress tolerances (e.g. frost, drought, salinity) which are key traits for good performance under marginal conditions. However, both projects worked on small trial plots and identified utilization options only at lab scale. Miscanthus or hemp varieties that are specifically suitable for marginal lands are not yet available. A major bottleneck for development of such varieties is the lack of information on their large scale performance. Therefore the next step to develop these biomass crops for the growing bioeconomy is to demonstrate the feasibility of upscaling their production. Cultivars also need to meet the quality requirements of the specific end uses. Based on knowledge gained by the projects OPTIMISC and MultiHemp, the biomass composition of the germplasm is largely known and can be matched to the specific end uses. However, the upscaling of these value chains with tailored germplasm is not yet proven and represents a bottle neck for their wider application. The objective of this project is to demonstrate 1) the upscaling of crop production of miscanthus and hemp genotypes matched to end use and 2) their suitability for marginal, contaminated and unused land. Another aim of the project is to demonstrate the upscaling of the most promising biomass valorization chains with tailored genotypes. Various valorization options will be tested by associated partners (industry panel) and a subset will be demonstrated at (pre)commercial scale. The overall aim of the project is to have commercial cultivars, which are suitable for marginal, contaminated or unused land, available at the end of the project with proven feasibility for a set of end-uses. This includes their performance in the value chain, but also their environmental and economic profile.", 1019716.0, 13102024.0, "GRACE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210575_923605386"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7TA", "Early Years, Primary and Early Secondary School Core Skills", "Lincoln St. Peter at Gowts Primary School", 10711.0, "Saint Peter at Gowts School is a vibrant, inner city school with a diverse population. Since the school was classed by Ofsted as 'Requires Improvement', the school has many new members of staff who are new to the area and are keen to learn more about the diverse Eastern European population which the school serves. The school is currently 36% EAL, with this percentage increasing year after year. The key aim of our project is to help new arrivals settle in our school and start to make progress. We can facilitate this by understanding the cultural and educational context from which they originate. Our strategy to develop this knowledge is four half term visits over  two years. This will enable key individuals to immerse in the Eastern European culture . A series of visits would allow different teams to travel, with the initial focus being Poland, due to the nature of our school community and the existing link between Lincolnshire and Warminsko-Mazuria, a northern province east of Gdansk. Our key objectives are outlined below.Key Objective 1 - To celebrate diversity and ensure all pupils feel valued and their culture celebrated within schoolKey Objective 2 - To increase the confidence of EAL new starters through increased understanding and awareness of the different educational systemsKey Objective 3 - To increase community cohesion in the Sincil Bank area through EtwinningKey Objective 4 - To increase parental engagement with Eastern European parents through project work, links and greater understandingWe are hoping to facilitate 8 teachers (75% of teaching staff) visiting Eastern Europe to develop partnerships between schools and develop the teachers' understanding, empathy and specifically their knowledge about the different educational systems. The focus of the visits would be how schools develop the core skills of literacy and numeracy. We also hope to explore early years provision, developing an overview of the educational system, school leadership and management, and the possibility of eTwinning and building partnerships between schools. In particular, staff are keen to develop a 'new starter' resource pack, with leaflets outlining the differences between the school systems and what  parents and children should expect in their new setting. The impact we are hoping to show will be measurable against our Ofsted priorities and School Improvement Plan. We are hoping to improve EAL parent engagement, measured through attendance at parents meetings and open mornings. We also hope to ease transition of new starters through increased empathy and understanding. We also hope that the project to stengthen our school team, with teachers becoming passionate about teaching in an ethnically diverse school, being passionate about provision, inclusion and community cohesion.

We have recently developed this further though becoming a Global Learning Expert Centre and delivering training to other local partner schools. However, we feel that, although we have very strong links with schools abroad, and through our creative curriculum put much emphasis on developing our children as Global citizens, we lack the expertise within our staff to teach high quality French lessons to our KS2 children.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this project is to increase competency in the teaching of French across the school, further develop the quality of teaching as a whole, to fulfill our SDP target of challenging the more able and to develop middle leaders within the school.  This will result in more children achieving their end of year expectation through Key Stage 2.\r\n\r\nWe intend to achieve this through sending four enthusiastic teachers/teaching assistants to complete the highly recommended immersive French teaching course in Antibes, France.  We believe that through attending this course, which includes pure language teaching, teaching methodology training, as well as contact with French teachers and cultural immersion, the staff will return to school more confident and therefore competent in the teaching of French. The  training course will be repeated the year after and depending on the needs of the school either the original participants will attend or four different staff members.\r\n\r\nThrough initially identifying the needs of the participants  we expect this experience to have significant impact on both their personal and professional development. They will then use the self-evaluations completed by other staff members before the course to disseminate the appropriate learning, information, methodology and strategies to all members of our school and partner school\u2019s staff. Thus impacting on the quality of  the teaching of French throughout the wider school community.  This opportunity will also help to develop out European links, which will increase our International profile and provide more opportunity for future partnerships. \r\n\r\nIn terms of ensuring long terms benefits we are confident that the increased competency of teaching French, which will be achieved through this course, will enthuse our children, raise standards of teaching and learning  and start them on the lifelong language learning journey.", "http://www.bishopking.org.uk", "Bishop King CE Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046890_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7JN", "ERDF Technical Assistance", "Lincolnshire County Council", "GLLEP TA Project\n\nDeliver a technical assistance package, generating and underpinning a Greater Lincolnshire focus, throughout the ESIF programme\nIncreasing understanding and knowledge of the programme and activity calls, whilst also providing practical support to projects within the ESIF Process\nProvide a co-ordinated approach to delivery; drawing in expertise from sector specialists/strategic review groups to ensure good quality bids come forward from Greater Lincolnshire\n\nThis promotes ERDF opportunities via calls for activity, ensuring compliance, generating a pipeline set of proposals that contributes to successfully delivering the GL LEP ESIF Strategy and ERDF Operational Programme.", "ERDF", 194880.0, 324801.0, "erdf_england_129"], ["7JN", "Boston, Haven Banks Flood Defence Scheme", "Lincolnshire County Council", "This project is a priority for Greater Lincolnshire as it addresses the key issue of flood risk in an area of strategic economic importance where flooding, and the associated risk of flooding is having a negative impact on economic growth.
