It will be conducted by using an interactive and participative approach as well as many outdoor and sport activities. \r\nThe activities implemented will consist of an introduction to the development of sport in culture, a discussion on the use of sport as an educational method and the sharing of best practice examples of how youth work can help to promote the physical health and social wellbeing of young people. \r\nThe training course will stimulate active participation, sense of initiative and involvement of the young people in society and also their involvement in sport and physical activities. \r\nParticipants' prior experiences in youth work, particularly at local and regional level, will be important and used in the development of the learning process. \r\nActive group/team work, role-plays, outdoor and sport activities and plenary discussions, as well as theoretical inputs will characterize the program of the course in order to cover all aspects of the project themes.\r\n\r\n          The expected results are that the participants will gain knowledge, will discuss their ideas and will be supported to design their own practical examples on how to use sport as a tool in non-formal education settings.", "http://www.ask-academy.org.uk", "Academy of Strategic Knowledge", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012017_coordinator"], ["5JB", "Social Media Bridges", "Academy of Strategic Knowledge", 17066.0, "In the context of current European youth unemployment it is crucial that young people and social workers are aware of all tools available around them to carry out their own ideas and become (social) entrepreneurs through the use of social media tools. The main objective of this training is to strengthen the entrepreneurial attitude of the participants and convey the idea that becoming entrepreneurs, exploiting their own projects using media, is absolutely possible and  feasible.\r\n\r\nThe project involves 21 participants from 9 different countries (Greece,Italy,Spain,Germany,Austria,Poland,Lituania,Rumania and UK). Each partner organization will send 2 participants, including 6 participants with fewer opportunities due to their economic, social or geographic situation. Participants should be social workers or volunteers who are motivated to learn from social media tools, who have proved  their commitment with social projects. The participants must be willing to exert multiplier results and implement them in their local communitis, to disseminate and provoque a real impact in young people lifes. The activities are based in non formal education methods. The trainers will enhance the participants' tools to go deeper into their own possibilities and exploit strengths to become entrepreneurs using their own ideas. An atmosphere of creativity and trust will be created during the training to work in a safe environment where sharing will be easy.\r\n\r\nThis Training is originally inspired by The Digital Participation Camp (DPC) which aims at creating an active international network of digital innovators, social entrepreneurs, designers, developers and content creators to unite skills and work together on digital projects for social good. The European counter part \"Social media Bridges\" will be implemented along with the program of the Digital Participation Camp in M\u00fcnster in order to give a chance to social workers and commited and active youngsters to create social awareness and improve their entrepreneurial skills through Social Media Tools.\r\n\r\nBringing together digital innovators, social entrepreneurs, designers and campaigners from around the globe, participants will have them as mentors and as inspiration. Participants who would be already working with social media or absolutely interested in the topic as tool to create social change. Trainers, designers, entrepreneurs, project managers and others will serve as mentors to the participants and give feedback and advice everytime. Particularly in times of crisis there are products or services suddenly viable, that no other time could have been sold in the economic market due to a change of society circumstances. That crisis often provoques inequalities and unfair situations which can be defeated with social media tools. The training will  empower participants to create and spread the word about their projects using social media. \r\n\r\nThe training will be based team building sessions, workshops to enhance creativity and idea design workshops. Participants will finish the training knowing how to design their website, having understood the basics of shooting videos and cutting movies, and having created a huge networking for future projects around Europe. Their entrepreneriall skills will be increased by different workshops which will make participants reflect on their own potential and skills. The purpose is to explote the participant's ideas, to build up groups who would like to work in common projects and to come up with a final result after a 10 days training, We expect inspiring results which will be practical connected to a visible project and a learning outcome for every participant alike.\r\n\r\nAs a final element of the training there will be an event called the \"Summit\" in which participants will present their final results from the projects they worked on during the training to the local community in an organized event with the support of the municipality of M\u00fcnster. A Lipdub will be created by participants and will be shown during the Summit. The Social Media Bridges Summit will take together with the DPS (Digital Participation Summit - www.dpsummit.org). Both events, together with different project's presentations, will create a social and local impact without precedents. Results will be shared with the local community and will also bring spread the project results and the entrepreneurial spirit created in the event to the local community. There will also be a stand lead by The Global Experience to inform citizens about the new  Erasmus+ Program  and its opportunities.\r\n\r\nAbout the diffusion and multiplier effect, we will have special sessions focused on preparing materials for dissemination. The purpose is to prepare compilation of photos, a video about the project and press releases as well as posts for various blogs in which all activities from the training will be displayed.

They are often suffering from having limited access to educational opportunities, which in turn diminishes their chances on the labor market. Low level of community involvement among young people from rural areas is commonly seen as a direct result of the above mentioned obstacles. However, we believe that the community involvement should actually be perceived as the solution to those problems. By committing to work for the benefit of their surrounding, young people become more active, gain valuable knowledge and develop many essential social skills that can serve as a great advantage in both their professional and personal life.Young people from geographically disadvantaged areas often have a will to get more involved in their community life, but they are lacking information on how to do so, as there are not enough projects and activities fitting their specific expectations and needs. We find it essential to educate youth workers active in disadvantaged areas on the benefits of creating more participatory based projects and to equip them with practical tools enabling them to recognize the expectations of youth they work with. The proposed project is to gather 28 youth workers and young leaders from both Program and Eastern Partnership countries and provide them with a space to discuss the specifics of working with youth from disadvantaged communities, explore different aspects of participation and equip them with tools and methods for promoting it in their respective home communities. The project objectives are defined as follows:- exploring practical tools and methods for increasing active participation of young people from geographically disadvantaged areas- discussing the specific challenges and identifying possible solutions connected to work with youth with fewer opportunities (comming from geographically disadvantaged regions)- exploring the concept of participation and its connection to improving the community life in disadvantaged areas- providing participants with an opportunity to create a concrete action plan for increasing of their target groups that can be implemented upon coming back to their respective home communities- establishing a network of like-minded organizations and individuals who are interested in further cooperation on the topics connected to rural development and work with youth with fewer opportunities The project is to increase participating youth workers' professional capacities in terms of promoting youth participation that can bring benefits both to the individuals as well as contribute to a sustainable development of geographically disadvantaged communities. In a long term perspective the project shall result in an increase openness amongst youth workers to use more innovative and creative methods, which in turn should contribute to a higher quality of their everyday work for promoting social inclusion.", "http://www.ask-academy.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-AT02-KA105-001673_1"], ["5JB", "Spread the Word: Visibility, DEOR & Networking", "Academy of Strategic Knowledge", 21004.0, "\u201cSpread the Word: Visibility, DEOR & Networking\"\r\n                                                                                                               12-19 April 2017\r\n                                                                                                              Dresden, Germany\r\n\r\nWe believe that the key elements of sustainable and successful international youth and community projects are strongly determined by the effective and efficient promotion and dissemination of the impact of these projects. Youth organisations may run successful projects with young people and youth workers, having a great impact on their personal and professional development. However, if the results and the learning outcomes of youth projects are not effectively disseminated, they are visible and accessible to the local communities, the society in general, the stakeholders and even the youth organisations at local, regional, national and international level. \r\n\r\nA multiplier effect should be achieved so that the projects are sustainable. It's a reality that most of the youth organisations have a difficulty in disseminating the results of their projects and making them visible in an efficient way so that they are accessible to different target groups. The need to develop a good communication strategy so that all partners are actively involved and they also disseminate the results of the projects is indispensable. For this reason, the training course \"Spread the Word: Visibility, Dissemination & Networking\" aims to gather youth workers, youth project coordinators and trainers so that they work together on a communication , visibility and dissemination strategy. The participants are expected to share best practices, successful examples of project dissemination, visibility and communication during this training course.\r\n\r\nWorking closely with youth organizations from different countries in Europe is an important objective of this training course so that a strong international network is built. Therefore, we will spend a substantial part of the programme on partnership building activities and work together on the development of our projects' visibility and dissemination as well as on the communication among partners. Te topic of this training course is par excellence a matter about which we need to develop long term strategies that can be effective at all levels; local, regional, national and international/European level.\r\n\r\n34 participants from Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Spain and UK will be gathered in City Herberge, Dresden. The training course is designed for youth workers, volunteers, trainers, project managers and any other people who are directly involved working with Erasmus+ projects and/or other type of international collaborations.  We are going to develop a communication strategy that will improve the visibility and dissemination of the project's results and learning outcomes as well their impact on the target groups. \r\nDeveloped new cooperations with youth organisations throughout Europe. We trust that this training course will contribute to improving quality of Erasmus+ projects and development of competent youth and community workers internationally.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to explore the concepts and benefits of working on the visibility & dissemination of European youth and community projects by means of a well elaborated communication strategy and to build a strong international network of youth organisations that work with Erasmus+ projects. The participants and their organisations as a result:\r\n\u2022 will know how to define visibility and dissemination;  \r\n\u2022 will learn why visibility and dissemination are important in international youth and community work; \r\n\u2022 will share good practices and successful examples of visibility and dissemination in European youth and community projects;\r\n\u2022 will develop different tools and methodology for addressing issues of visibility and dissemination;\r\n\u2022 will develop a communication strategy that will improve the quality of the projects' impact and the sustainability of their projects\r\n\u2022 will build their international network so that new partnerships will be developed throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe training programme consists of 6 different types of activities:\r\n1.
