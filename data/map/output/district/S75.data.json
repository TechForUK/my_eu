Testing of laminates and prepregs production based the new developed carbon fibres followed by manufacturing of laminates/coupons and high-performance filament wound tubes are also foreseen (equipment for delivering precise volumes the matrix (resin) in high and low-capacity to impregnate the fibres and bundles will be developed). The project also efforts on functionalization will be mainly focused on cost reduction, mechanical and chemical property improvement. Novel CF precursors will be developed (silicon carbide, textile-grade PAN, polyolefins, and lignin); in parallel, the suitability of a new environmentally friendly pitch will be assessed, obtained from anthracene oil, for the preparation of isotropic carbon fibres. The project\u2019s carbon fiber conversion technology will pyrolysis process to convert PAN precursor fiber into PAN-based carbon fiber and activated carbon fiber. Innovative surface treatment will improve the step of treatment of the carbon fiber surface being indispensable for productions in series. As for recycling and used of recycled CFs, new techniques will be used to provide commercially-relevant products that are manufactured from waste carbon fibres. Mathematical modeling will be conducted so as to determine properties of CFs and composites, together with cost modeling; life cycle assessment will assist in possible commercial risks that will be continuously estimated during the project and quantify/assess the environmental impact of the materials that will be used.

The centre has got an up-to-date transition to secondary school plan, students move from three primary schools, fact which makes us a reference school in our town. The school has started a transformation process lately,it has been equipped with computers and projectors in every classroom and three computer classrooms. Education availability has also been widened recently and Basic Professional Trainig and Intermediate Vocational Training Cycles can be studied in our school now.\r\nTeachers have a great commitment to improve their training in languages and innovative and creative methodologies. Equity and awareness of diversity proceedings are taken in order to correct inequality, paying attention to students with excellent performance and to students with learning problems. That's the reason of our Multilingual Program where more subjects are taught in English every year, the Performance Improvement Program or the Reinforcement Plan. All these programs are also combined with the use of new technologies. All these measures are taken to guide students through the education system and life in general.\r\nTo start this project would give a big push towards the way our school has already initiated. The great number of departments which are involved in the project,more than 60% of the whole of our school, is already a big success. The aim of this project is to achieve a school which is connected and open,a school which has got initiative, whose activities are exciting, creative and motivating.In short, a school able of making experiences where learning is inevitable. By connecting departments and other schools in our town, we want to be a reference school and be able to improve the opportunities of employment in our municipality.\r\nThis project wants to remove the weaknesses which were detected in SWOT, mainly the lack of coordination,a better use of ITC\u2019s as well as a methodological improvement. It is clear that teaching does not mean to explain but to make learning easier. That is the reason why 2020 planned aims are Creativity, Innovation and Enterprise as well as achieving a more internationalized school.\r\nEverything is focus on improving students' competences by using teachers as knowledge transmitters. The final aim we want to achieve is not teachers' improvements, improvements which will happen per se, but students' involvement in their learning process and the fact that students can start the change.Being able to create a shool structural change which can be sustainable over a long period.\r\nAn Erasmus+ committee has been set up. The committee and the Erasmus+ coordinator will monitor, evaluate and control the project in all its stages, The project evaluation will not only be done on the final results or on the achieved effect but also a report indicating the obtained landmarks will be done every term by the e+elcampello committee. This method will create a working routine which can provide with new ideas in the future. We already have an activity chronogram which relates the mobility training and Job Shadowing to the agreed department activities and the 2020 project aims.\r\nEvery mobility contributes to the project and it has been chosen carefully to be essential and at the same time complementary among the other activities. The schools which we have chosen (United Kingdom and Denmark) have a wide experience in the issues which we want to be trained and to observe how they perform these practical activities will be essential to get results. The activities which we have to carry out have been explained in detail. The activities are connected among the departments to do a cooperative task which creates quality materials and they are also coordinated with different schools. There are very impressive endings such as a \"escape room\"and a play in the local theatre in addition to some activities carried out in Primary schools from the town.\r\nWe have an ambitious project, and its impact and spreading will also be ambitious. We want to spread our project among a large number of people and not only in our town. A diffusion plan has been designed in which there is a social network coordinator and some people who perform their function by using adequate hashtags and necessary resources to carry out the spreading. \r\nIn the end, if the project in not sustainable, it cannot be considered as a successful project, on that principle we guarantee the continuity of the project with a wide range of educational offering and with future projects KA102 and KA229.", "http://www.dartoncollege.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049541_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S75"}
