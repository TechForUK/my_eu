According to the WHO the burden of cancer can be reduced by systematic and equitable implementation of evidence based strategies for cancer prevention, early detection and management of patients with cancer.  33% of the cancer burden could be reduced if detected early and treated adequately. The WHO concludes that, early diagnosis of cancers could save the developed world an average of \u20ac40 billion per year on medical costs and \u20ac80 billion per year on realized productivity. The direct savings on medical treatment alone would be more than \u20ac10.000 per patient if early detection was possible. Early cancer diagnosis today consists of recognition of some of the \u2018early\u2019 signs by the patient themselves or detection from screenings carried out on specific population groups.    If something suspicious is found the next step is to perform a blood analysis and/or to look with non-invasive imaging techniques. Current imaging techniques are widely used in diagnostic procedures but they cannot give conclusive evidence of  cancer. Today, only a biopsy and the subsequent pathologist\u2019s interpretation can give a definitive diagnosis of cancer  and this is not always enough EDOCAL will use a tunable blue laser to selectively excite an accumulated photo sensitizer, called proto-porphyrin. This sensitizer is taken by the patient to enhance contrast between healthy and cancerous tissue. Reflected light is filtered using state of the art ultra narrow photonic crystal technology. Initial studies have shown that it is possible to detect cancerous tissue using blue light in combination with FDA approved sensitizers (ALA-5 and Proto-Porphyrin). This tool will be based on the principle of preferential retention of proto-porphyrin by cancer cells. The purpose of this project is to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection by combining state of the art laser and imaging technology with leading medical research.", 35483.0, 1562673.0, "EDOCAL", "Early cancer detection by laser", "Early detection of cancer saves lives, improves quality of life and reduces health care cost.

EU-funded \u2018Early detection of cancer using photonic crystal lasers\u2019 (http://www.edocal.eu (EDOCAL)) project aims to create a breakthrough tool for early cancer detection.\n\nCell in the tumours tend to create additional blood vessels to support their growth. The molecule protoporphyrin (PpIX) is generally present in blood vessels and exhibits red fluorescence when excited with blue light in the 375 - 425 nm range. Cancer cells could be detected by observing the red fluorescence at a matching excitation wavelength. To increase the intensity of the red fluorescence, a porphyrin prodrug (Pp) can be administered either orally or locally to create additional PpIX in the cancerous tissue. By using a tuneable laser system and combination of endogenous fluorescence and exogenous fluorescence (produced by administration of a Pp), it is possible to accurately distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue.\n\nDuring 2 years of the project researchers developed tuneable blue laser system for research purposes. The spectra from 290 sites in the oesophagus of 77 patients were registered and showed that it is possible to detect early cancer with 80 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity. Proof of concept has been achieved for early detection of cancer based on a tuneable blue laser technology. The first patent application has been filed and new filings for the latest results are under way.\n\nThe project achieved the goal of creation of the device that can be used as the first line cancer detection. This device will reduce the need for biopsies, make the diagnosis more reliable, less dependent on human interpretation and make early cancer detection available to more people.", "http://www.edocal.eu", null, "/docs/results/images/2014-04/58269.jpg", "fp7_95907_991614026"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8LE", "SYMBOLS - Culture of Death & Cultural Life: New audiences and creations around European Cemeteries!", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 152775.0, "SYMBOLS is an innovative interdisciplinary cooperation project that pretends to create and test new approaches to discover European Cemeteries, in order reinforce the knowledge and public awareness on its hidden heritage.Among its key objectives, we can highlight:1) The exchange of cultural and creative works, reinforcing the cultural and creative sector\u2019s capacity to operate transationally, through the mobility of artists (printmakers, dancers and musicians) and their work, as well as of cultural and creative players (cultural managers/decision-makers)2) Audience development, by using the cemeteries as interactive \u201copen-air museums\u201d that can be visited, focusing on young people and on people with disabilities (blind and deaf people), to stimulate interest and improve access to such tangible heritage, as well as improve the skills and competences of key players  in working with such audiences.3) Promote the use of digital technologies (Augmented Reality Browsers) to create new routes of \u201csymbols\u201d to discover this hidden heritage, as well as to work and test them with the new audiences (young people and people with disabilities)As far as its results are concerned, we can mention:- Participation and test with at least 120 young people from 6 countries- Creation of 6 \u201croutes of symbols\u201d by the young people on ARTOUR mobile application.- Adaptation of ARTOUR to the needs of blind people (3 pilot tests in Maribor, Avil\u00e9s & CC Nebbiu)- Joint artistic residences for 15 printmakers (etching, lithography, silkscreen, relief, monoprint, etc.) from 7 countries- Joint artistic residences for 5 dancers and 10 musicians from 6 countries- Coproduction of 1 multidisciplinary exhibition open in 2016 in 7 countries, 9 places: objective 27.000 visitors (3000/place)- 3 Manuals of Good Practices to be transferred to +-1000 stakeholders through Workshops and networking activities - Particip. of +- 100 blind people and +- 100 deaf people - Strong ICT & Media communication", null, null, "creative_551981-CREA-1-2014-1-ES-CULT-COOP1_3"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["8LE", "Leading Learning Academy Reciprocal Network", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 50765.0, "Since the merger of Dundee College & Angus College in 2013, the new D&A College is undertaking a major modernisation agenda.\r\nThrough the establishment of a Leading Learning Academy (LLA) in 2013, it aims to realise its new ambition - advancing D&A College's aspiration for excellence in learning and teaching and all of its services, and to facilitate the development of first class professional learning for everyone who works at the College.\"\r\n\r\nTo help staff to strive for excellence, we aim to provide stimulating experiences & expose them to excellent innovative practices abroad.

This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 20 Dundee United FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Turkey. The Turkish host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Turkish and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur Turkish partner and the associated local Turkish clubs are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. Dundee United FC have recently completed a successful mobility trip to Turkey in January 2014 and this has formed the foundation for this Erasmus+ funding application.\r\n\r\nYoung people in Dundee and Tayside are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people in the region where many have poor records of academic achievement and are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in Tayside will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this regional shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. Football clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\nDundee United FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.\r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, Dundee United FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK  football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework.

She's former international contact person in Kokem\u00e4ki unit, so her skills and competence in students' mobilities are high. Our Internationality process has been changed in the beginning of 2016 such a way that many functions are centralized, e.g. all Sataedu's Learning Agreements are prepared by only one person. This procedure quarantees the same quality to every agreement. In addition in the end of the period, the return training takes place now in every unit in such a way that the coordinator, contact person, mentor and students join together to receive the blogs or final report and to fill in both mobility tool + report and Sataedu's own Wepropol inquiry. During  the feedback conversation and returning the evaluation forms / Europasses, the recognizion and acknowledge of learning outcomes is carried out. Thanks to the reorganization of our internationalization process, it also enables the second call of mobility request during one academic year (one call every semester ). This procedure enables for students, who are graduating earlier, to plan their study path in a way that certain part of the studies can be achieved through the internship abroad.  Sataedu will expand the students' mobilities also for the students with special needs. From this field Sataedu doesn't have any experience yet, and for that reason we'll start with very small group in Cyprus, where the partner is very reliable and high quality.

The two colleges had been active in European projects under the Lifelong Learning Programme and Interreg since 2007.  During that time we gained experience of how to manage European projects from concept through to final reporting and on being awarded the VET Charter we have now embarked on Project DARE (D & A  Reach out to Europe) where the combined college continues in this direction.  The principles behind the international strategy are that the Charter would facilitate the internationalising of the curriculum, where all academic areas would have the opportunity to devise programmes that include a mobility, aligned to their course requirements,  and cross college support services, who previously might not have considered a mobility,  would become  equally involved. Project DARE therefore involves turning the strategy into a series of yearly objectives as per the application, and this has involved work in awareness raising, (dissemination of the Charter benefits, with adverts on the College portal, a presentation to all academic areas, production of leaflets as well as a \u2019roadshow\u2019 open to all where International staff gave talks and led discussions on the Charter across the three campuses) and the publication of a complete Mobility Handbook. The key messages are that:\u2022 The Charter is a five year plan so allows for departments to take a longer term view in planning their curricula. All academic areas are involved  \u2013 those with little or no experience can start to explore, seek partners and plan for 2017/18 and those with previous experience could further develop their links to international institutions.\u2022 Secondly, the message was propagated that all staff could become involved \u2013 not just teaching staff, but support and administration staff in order they could witness good practice in other organisations  \u2013 sometimes being involved for the first time in such an endeavour.\u2022 Thirdly, a range of providers or recipient organisations have been selected for us to work with in a reciprocal manner. These include  Colleges, Universities, VET organisations, Cultural organisations and private training providers. Some are new to us, but all have come with recommendations, or are Charter holders,  or ones with whom we have previously  worked \u2013 and new teaching and development approaches will arise from these exchanges. This first year\u2019s submission therefore embodies the ethos as well as the processes described in the Charter application  - representing a cross section of the College\u2019s functions: Horticulture (CZ), Performing Arts (Norway and France), OD (Sweden), Support Services (Spain and Finland), Hair & Beauty (Finland), Creative & Digital (Italy), Travel & Tourism (Slovenia) and Business and Teacher Training (Finland). Our students will undoubtedly benefit from these placements in our partner\u2019s business and VET centres. This will provide them with new and exciting experiences and staff  members will develop new relationshps with their international counterparts  and the D&A curriculum will be enhanced  thus benefiting our future students. The numbers of students in this '16/17 application is quite close to the  number anticipated in the Charter application, at 103. The number of staff (38) is a total of those on a staff mobility and those accompanying students and is determined by the need to accompany student mobilities for a) the security and safety of the group ie 1 staff member per 10 students as recommended in the Guide and/or b) the requirement to have two members for staff development purposes c) to further develop the relationship between institutions and d) allow mobility to staff other than teaching. All staff and students will receive a pre-mobilty \u2019programme\u2019 \u2013 following the processes detailed in the D&A Handbook,  whereby language training needs, and any other special needs are assessed, and country familiarisation briefings will take place.

The Attainment Challenge is a unique initiative as it aims to close the \u2018Attainment Gap\u2019 related to poverty, it is focused on providing extra resources in schools and nurseries within Scotland\u2019s poorest communities in a bid to raise attainment in Literacy, Numeracy and Health and Wellbeing. The Attainment Challenge is underpinned by the documents The National Improvement Framework, The Curriculum for Excellence, and \u2018Getting it right for Every Child\u2019 (GIRFEC).  In 2014 Sue Ellis and Edward Sosu completed research for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation entitled \u201cClosing the Attainment gap in Scottish education\u201d, Its key findings proved to be difficult reading, and it prompted the government to explore equity in education. Every child should be afforded the same opportunities to succeed. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe gap between children from low-income and high-income households starts early. By age 5, it is 10\u201313 months. Lower attainment in literacy and numeracy is linked to deprivation throughout primary school. By age 12\u201314 (S2), pupils from better-off areas are more than twice as likely as those from the most deprived areas to do well in numeracy. Attainment at 16 (the end of S4) has risen overall, but a significant and persistent gap remains between groups.\u201d (Sosu and Ellis, 2014)\r\n\r\nThis information prompts brave new thinking and a bold approach.  It is necessary to look outwards, across Europe, to seek inspiration and learn from the most effective models and practices. \r\n\r\nWe have reflected on our own practice and read widely about international approaches to Early Years Education, however, it is necessary to create our own pedagogy, a Scottish Model. The approach we wish to take inspiration from is the Reggio Approach. The diverse cultures and socioeconomic circumstances welcomed by our nursery necessitate a non discriminatory, encouraging, inclusive approach. Every child and family must have a voice. The Reggio Approach is unparalleled with their confidence in the children's competencies and the ability to listen to every child's voice is truly valued. \r\n\r\nThe project therefore aims to address 3 specific areas in order to enhance and innovate:\r\n\r\nLeadership and Management\r\nLearning Provision\r\nSuccesses and Achievements\r\n\r\nBy addressing these 3 areas, the project main objectives are :\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative approaches to our teaching and learning\r\n- Develop an understanding of creative approaches\r\n- Improving our teaching and learning by raising staff expertise and competences within a European context\r\n- Develop an understanding of practice in Europe\r\n- Improve children's outcomes by developing new learning methods and strategies\r\n- Develop links with schools in Europe\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our objectives we have planned to provide opportunity for 12 staff to attend a structured training course in Italy ''Creative Teaching in Early Years and Preschool Education, Bologna.\"  \r\nThe course offers a unique opportunity, not only will be on location in Emilia Romagna but the training team are very specialised in their expertise regarding neuro-lingustics and child development. We will gain insight into how the child's brain thinks creatively, and the foundations of language development- essential to be inclusive in our multicultural setting with a high number of children with additional needs and difficult backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe staff selected to attend are committed and dedicated to the children and families in our community. They have a great deal of experience and expertise and a high proportion of the staff are currently studying degree and postgraduate courses. We are applying for 12 places on the training course and these will certainly be filled as there is a great level of excitement surrounding the experience. There is an understanding that this transformational project is long term and a commitment of both time and motivation is required by all to see it through.

Students\u00b4 ability to co-operate in a group improves and their models of action and identity are constructed towards a more positive and sustainable direction. Students learn how to communicate in English and learn to control their financial affairs; in other words, they learn more about the basic skills in life. The self-controlled and goal-oriented use of social media before, during and after the mobilities increases the knowledge of the responsibilities and rules of digital communication and 21st century skills. The aim of the project is not only to increase professional skills but also simultaneously interactive and life-management skills of our students.

This together with discussions on the different sectors has lead to the policy plan of the International office (annex 1). Here we describe a number of goals + activities we will work on the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe big objective is to work towards a curriculum that has an International context. This is a process that takes time. We will start with one course where lessons will be given in English, the teachers involved get the possibility to do a CLIL course or a language course abroad.\r\nTo reach the overall goal we have different smaller goals:\r\n- student mobility, we want to send each year more students to reach te 6% goal the Dutch minister of Education has set.

This platform is important because the participants have to translate the ideas to the teams and students. The participants in this platform support the students in all the steps that are needed to go abroad, information, preparation, practical issues, tutoring, validation and dissemination. Also they inform and help the colleagues.\r\nThere is also a strategic platform, herein participate the director of the sector of Bussiness, the coordinator of the international Office and a member of the Board.\r\n\r\nWe use our website and ELO for information and training purposes. We have developed a number of documents and there is a list to control (annex 7). Students are doing a number of tasks before going. Their tutor in the college is deciding which tasks have to be done. Every participant has to write a final report which can be published on the website. Also they have to give a presentation.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our partners abroad.

The partner network of Omnia has enlarged by adding Austria and Latvia and new project countries during the last project period. Now our intention is to include even Portugal and Lithuania in this KA1-project. This because we at Omnia, also according to our international strategy, want to offer opportunity for international experiences (mainly in the form of on-the-job learning periods abroad) for possibly many students and from all Omnia vocational fields. In Lithuania we would have two new co-operation fields: logistics and property maintenance and that's why this new partner and country interests us. In Portugal the fields would be hotel, restaurant and travelling and in those fields we have had lack of placements and partners in relation to our applicants from those fields. From the security field Omnia has not either yet had any international activities, because we have now educated this field only for one year at Omnia, but we would find out if any of our existing partners also educates  this field and our objective is to start international co-operation also in this field during this new project period. \r\n\r\nFrom the last projects countries Slovakia will be excluded, because students have not applied there and co-operation was not implemented with the country last year either. Omnia's biggest partners are vocational institutes in Europe, but also a few Chambers of Crafts in Germany are included in this project and they also act as our reciprocal partners, which means that Omnia does not only send students to Germany via them but also receives students from them to practice in Finland in many different fields.\r\n\r\nOmnia has plenty of direct company co-operation in Europe, but because most of co-operation companies abroad act without pic-codes, they are not included in this application. Our intention is to include them later as receiving organizations when implementing the project. \r\n\r\nOmnia's one strategical objective is to offer internationalization opportunities for the whole staff, not only for teachers. That's why Omnia offers possibility to apply expert grants also for administrative personnel, guidance counselors, college nurses, curators, Omnia youth workshop personnel and staff of college canteen personnel. One project objective would also be to use a few of expert grants to reinforce co-operation between Omnia and local Finnish companies, who regularly receive foreign students via Omnia to practice at them. Reinforcing would happen by offering the key persons of those companies an opportunity to make an international mobility period of one week by themselves. \r\n\r\nInternationalization is already built in Omnia Curriculum in the form of one new learning unit called: To be a professional internationally.\r\nStudents can carry out this learning unit by doing an on-the-job training period abroad but also by doing their practicing period at some international company in Finland in case the company language is English.\r\n\r\nMost of the applied grants are single grants, which we coordinate one by one but also try to form pairs or small groups of students to each target country. In this application we apply many group mobilities: for instance a 10 student group in the field of AV-communication to Germany for 12 days, 5 students from social- and health care to Ireland for a month, 5 -student -group in the field of joinery to Estonia for 2 weeks (because our partner has a better CNC-machine than Omnia) and 8 student group from the fields of electricity, plumbing, joinery and house building to the Netherlands for three weeks. We apply grants for accompanying persons to travel with groups, because students in these fields are young and would not dare travel without a safe adult.\r\n\r\nInternational project work, including international mobility periods, will be handled both in the applying phase and during the actual working period of each project, in Omnia's pedagogical development team. There are representatives from Omnia's different divisions in this group. The members of pedagogical development team are working as contact persons between the students and personnel of their own vocational field and management of Omnia and between National project services and International team.

There will be discussions concerning the schedule and programme, and staff will also relate to their opposite number to identify issues in advance. Staff will receive briefings on assessment and support issues, inc. ECVET, and travel arrangements will be handled by the administration section of the International team as well as an external travel company.

Phase 2 includes language classes, a growth mindset workshop, team building day and a finance workshop to support future learning and direction for these individuals. \r\n\r\nPhase 3  will see both Scottish and Spanish participants pair together in Cordoba for 6 days to complete football training tasks to develop teamwork, communication, understanding and social skills. Language sessions developing English and Spanish for both groups will be used to build knowledge and skills to communicate with our partnering groups during activity and with locals when visiting landmarks and planning activity. Time will also be spent delivering session focusing on health and well being, these are arranged to educate participants on the qualities of foods, how to manage food intake and how to establish a balanced diet. Reflection periods have also been placed within mobility where participants can continually review their personal development and match their achievements up against agreed /shared learning outcomes at the start. In addition to this reflection period all participants will be asked to plan a small number of activities during mobility which incorporate both groups in landmark visits, research opportunities and team building activity. \r\n\r\nPost mobility - Will see participants evaluate their experiences over the past 6 months through a report. An independent review through Dundee City Council will also take place during project time. This allows participants, DFC staff and partnering organisations to see what changes they have undergone in their mindset, skills, aspirations and attitudes. We will gather as a group for the final stage, and invite speakers to talk about what employers' expectations are, recruitment plans, etc, further education institutions talk about possible college options, individuals from training organisations who have expertise in working with young people and who can offer them further opportunities e.g. volunteering (including volunteering abroad). Each participant will develop and agree their own Action Plan, and even for those who are continuing or re-engaging with school, we will ensure they are offered extra-curricular activities and contact is maintained. We will undertake 3,6 and 12 month follow ups and at the end of the project in 2019, we will host a celebratory event including all participants, partner organisations and parents.\r\n\r\nLong-term aims of this project are to encourage greater social inclusion for the group with DFC looking to support the inspired levels of development which shapes the brighter future.", null, "Dundee Football Club in the Community Trust (SCIO)", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA105-047701_coordinator"], ["8LE", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009203", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 256851.0, "The most essential way of implementing Omnia's international Strategy is to plan and carry out reciprocal student and expert mobilities from and to Omnia. Part of the internalization strategy objectives are also carried out in Erasmus + KA2- development projects, in which Omnia is developing for instance new pedagogigal practises and high-quality education for immigrant students.\r\nDuring the present project period Omnia's partner network has expanded with a few target areas: Lithuania, Croatia, Portugal, Malta and Mallorca. Our aim is to start reciprocal student mobility co-operation with our new Lithuanian partner in the field of property maintenance, because Omnia has educated this field already for years, but there has not been international co-operationin this field in the past years at all in Omnia. We also aim to send some students in the next project period to Portugal, because during this project period only staff members have visited from Omnia there. We send mostly students from the fields of business and administration, audiovisual communication and technical fields to Malta and Mallorca.\r\n\r\nIn the becoming project period Omnia's co-operation partners' network would be expanded with ten new partners, which are located partially both in new target countries and partially in excisting partner countries. Omnia is for instance starting co-operation in metal field with a new German partner college, security field co-operation with a new Danish college and  going on IT-field co-operation with a new Irish language school after this spring's piloting mobilities there. We also sent first students to Malta and Mallorca via our new partner institutions this year and are looking forward to hear students' experiences in these new areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are exclunding Hungary from our present partner countries in this project, because in two years no student or staff member has applied there. Omnia's biggest partners will continue co-operating with Omnia: they are European multi-field co-operation colleges, with whom we make reciprocal co-operation. Omnian has most of its partner organisations and colleges in Germany. In this application there are ten German institutes. Co-operation with them is well-working and flexible and Omnia's students and experts  consider the country interesting. That is the reason for a big number of applied grants to Germany in this application. We apply also grants for two ten-student-groups to Germany and this fact adds also the number of applied mobilities to Germany.\r\n\r\nOmnia is also co-operating to some scale directly with smaller European companies. Some vocational fields (social and health care) have most of their partners without PIC. We will add these partners during the project period in the Mobility Tool-platform. \r\n\r\nIn this application Omnia applies also 8 grants for long;  5-6 months mobilites for audiovisual communication, tourism, hotel and restaurant field and business and administration fields students. Omnia took part in piloting long mobilities in a project called European Pathway, a Gateway to work and got very good experiences of them. There were no difficulties of recruiting students for these mobilities and we believe that also in future there would be suitable applicants for them.", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046821_13"], ["8LE", "D&A Reach into Europe - 3", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", 282770.0, "Project 'DARE-3'   (D & A  Reach out to Europe - Three) builds on the success of the first two years of the mobilities programme under the VET Charter, with year 2 currenlty in progress. \r\n\r\nThe  original principle which drove the international strategy was that the Charter would facilitate the internationalising of the curriculum, where all academic areas would have the opportunity to devise programmes that include a mobility, aligned to their course requirements, and cross college support services, who previously might not have considered a mobility, would become equally involved. Possessing the Charter means that College staff have the ability to make long term plans and devise their mobilities to fit with their academic and term time frames.  \r\n\r\nAcross the College, the general awareness of the European programme is now very high and new sections of the College are now engaged which will inspire new teaching and development approaches in those areas,   The international team have run an ongoing internal communications campaign to publicise and promote the Erasmus Plus Mobilities through all forms of media \u2013 from leaflets, to broadcasts on the portal, to running roadshows, presentations to all academic areas, and the publication of a complete Mobility Handbook.  This campaign was awarded a prize in the Scottish College Development Network Marketing awards - held at a prestigious  Edinburgh venue in March 2017.  \r\n\r\nIn this year's application we add new College departments to the programme - including Construction (to Berlin), Science (Spain), Supported Education (Finland), and Hospitality (Italy). This is a welcome diversification across the college academic areas that are not usually represented in mobilities.   Each year sees an increase in demand and therefore our application reflects this higher activity level. \r\n\r\nAs stated in the previous years report,  DARE - 3 involves reviewing the current year\u2019s programme, involving departments in reviewing their experience and turning their strategy into a series of yearly objectives as per the application.  Also, internal systems of budgeting and financial control are under continuous review as our grasp of the Erasmus Plus mobilities rules becomes more complete and our confidence grows in the Mobility Tool + as a means of recording the required information. \r\n\r\nAll staff and students who are confirmed on a mobility receive a pre-mobilty \u2019programme\u2019 \u2013 following the processes detailed in the D&A Mobility Handbook,  whereby language training needs, and any other special needs are assessed, and country familiarisation briefings take place. There are discussions concerning the schedule and programme, and staff will also communicate with their opposite number to identify issues in advance. Staff will receive briefings on assessment and support issues, inc. ECVET, and travel arrangements will be handled by the administration section of the International team as well as an external travel company. \r\n\r\nThe Mobility + tool is used to record the mobilities and  the other information that is required by Erasmus, but the finance team also keep detailed records and accounts. As Project 2-DARE progresses and DARE - 3 starts the administrative and operational issues are identified across the college and the lessons learned fed back into the planning for succeeding mobilities. \r\n\r\nWe are also building long term partnerships with our various EU partners,  our network is growing by working on mobility and will lead to other projects which will be of mutual benefit in future years.", "http://www.dundeeandangus.ac.uk", "DUNDEE AND ANGUS COLLEGE", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047216_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DD3"}
