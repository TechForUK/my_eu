In the last phase, 3 teachers 1 administrator will participate in \"Problem-Based Learning-A Practical Guide\" in France in June 2015. \r\nA SWOT analysis, teacher meetings, a survey of expectation, a questionnaire in the preparatory process; a check list, meeting, diary, observation during the practice process; an action plan, a survey, reporting in the evaluation and dissemination processes will be the methods to be used in the project implementation plan (methodology).\r\nOutcomes and impact of the project upon three different groups are summarized as follows; it is expected to make the participants more open and interested to other cultures; to increase their motivation in teaching activities; to have acareer  in intercultural and social proficiency; to increase their academic knowledge in their teaching fields, to improve their existing knowledge and to get the ability to use this knowledge both in-class and non-class activities, to understand different educational systems in European standards, to increase the motivation to learn a new language, to increase the knowledge in administration, to increase the ability to use ICT. As far as institutional outcomes are concerned it is expected to encourage other teachers to play a role in similar activities, to increase intercultural awareness, to create a better cooperation environment among the teachers, to introduce and to use new teaching and learning techniques and to make our school a certified \u201cEuropean School\u201d. \r\nAs for the students; our aim is to make them open to other cultures and to increase their interest to these cultures, increased motivation in learning and innovations, to shape them into creatively and critically thinking individuals who use ICT and media consciously, to encourage the use and learning of a foreign language, to increase their academic success in English, Maths,Science and Technology and Social Studies, to maintain their school attendance by loving their school in general then their teachers and friends and thus to help them finish the school successfully.\r\nLong term project benefits are to create a motivation not only for the teachers of English language but also for the teachers of other academic branches to show a tendency for generating projects in the following years, sustaining the school success of the students, training them as enlightened citizens with the 21st century skills; as for the school administration; it is expected that there will be a European perspective by showing an understanding towards teachers and and creating a school environment that increases teachers\u2019 commitment.", "http://www.scarthojunior.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-TR01-KA101-003252_1"], ["2DH", "Despu\u00e9s de 200 a\u00f1os, nuevos retos, sue\u00f1os y proyectos.", "Scartho Junior Academy", 13945.0, "Our institution has a long educational tradition and we are currently implementing various changes with regards to our methodology, pedagogy, Organization and management. We hope that these changes will leave us better placed to confront the challenges and needs of modern society. After a participative process including all the schools which form a part of our institution .We believe that it is vital that we observe and analyse other education systems and methodologies in order that we can be better informed while making these important changes.\r\n \r\nThe activities that we believe are useful to us in our development project are as follows:\r\n\r\n-In regards to new experiential modern methodologies where the student is the protagonist in their learning, we have chosen a structured course in Reggio Emilia and two observation periods in three schools in the following countries: The United Kingdom, Finland and Estonia.\r\n\r\n-In regards to new technologies in education and AICLE we have chosen two structural courses in the United Kingdom.\r\n-Finally our management team school will visit a school in Estonia in order to observe the management and organization of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe participants attending the aforementioned structured courses have differing and distinct profiles, initially there will be an infant\u2019s school teacher trained in this pedagogy and another from the first stage of primary education. There will also be a representative for all the departments who use English as a vehicle language when teaching. English, Physical Education, Information technologies and art.\r\n\r\nDuring the observation periods the participants will all belong to the management and innovation team of our school. Therefore they already have the sufficient knowledge and skills to implement little by little the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nFollowing the aforementioned activities in the project we believe the results will be gradual. The benefits of this project will be long term and in the short term we can experiment with small changes in management, organisation and methodologies .Furthermore one of the first things we intend to do is to transfer all the knowledge and lived experiences taken from this project to our fellow teaching colleagues. It is through this process we intend to begin constructing a new school.", "http://www.scarthojunior.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037643_2"], ["2DH", "NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND!", "Scartho Junior Academy", 186088.0, "The idea of the project \u201cNO CHILD LEFT BEHIND\u201d springs from the consideration among  young teachers that through sport and drama activities students in our schools will gain three C\u2019s knowledge how to create, communicate and cooperate.\r\nWe are the teachers of primary or secondary schools located in eight European countries with different languages, cultures, traditions and school organization. We can state that there is a big number of children with special needs or cares, and students coming from other countries with the language gaps, that need to be taught  using lots of innovative methods in curricular and extracurricular activities.\r\nWe come from England, Italy, Romania, Turkey, Spain, Poland and  Estonia. We are teachers with different  cultural backgrounds united by a big will to collaborate and improve: ICT skills, solidarity, democratic values, tutoring, respect among participants.\r\nSome of us have already had in the past the special opportunity to live the experience of partnership inside Comenius program, others are newcomers. Everyone is  also  aware that it is very  important to encourage, allow and promote the best teaching practice  to draw  out  the best  from all the  young students in every country.\r\nThe strong  point  of our International collaboration:\r\nWelfare, wellness , handicap, equal opportunities opened to different range of students with all the possible needs, human rights, collaboration and citizenship, traditions, emotions, creativity, art, universal languages and signs .\r\nDrama courses, sport, different kind of games are the path to let the students give out the best ability of themselves cooperating with others, respecting rules, overcoming  their  limits, learning new languages in the knowledge to be important for others, comparing their results with others.\r\nLearning by doing is one of the most often chosen method  we will follow during the project activities where everyone is the actor of his growing path. Each person involved could try his/her special potential to show motivation, expression, language, mimic, ability to collaborate and learn inside a team group, and besides it students can  easily study  their own traditions (literature, authors , tales, legends, etc.) with other countries to understand how our past has influenced people and culture of each ethnic group. They will appreciate the importance of their heritage, and the importance of its transmission to other   generations. \r\nThrough drama, sport, art and music we wish to involve and develop students attitudes in their cognitive, affective, relational fields as they use universal body language: smile, simple sign sounds, emotions and dance, so everyone can be reflected in others and inter-act knowingly with a big number of people.\r\n Acting performances will help the community of students to access best results and improve their self-confidence; using technology devices and social networking will help them to know new friends, places, cultures  and appreciate values such as peace, brotherhood and cultural knowledge.\r\n We will measure through questionnaires  the effectiveness of the well teaching practice, the impact on the participants, the collaboration between the partners, the increase of European values and the conscience to be part of a global village with the same rights and the same responsibilities.\r\nWe  will also promote and increase human rights not just feelings and transmit  them as a real  way of life. All the communities will be aware of these practice: teachers, parents, authorities and volunteers .\r\nWe will do lots of activities: international meetings, collaboration with associated partners (actors, theatre members and sportsmen), exhibitions, plays, sport games, seminars, books; the results will be visible on the school websites\r\n\r\nThrough the project's activities students will acquire the knowledge regarding respect and responsibility for social values: family and community, natural and cultural environment. The entire learning process is organized as a non-formal teaching based on the place-based educational concept, which will include an experiential and cooperative learning approach, the learning through art approach, the project-based learning approach and ICT tools. \r\n\r\nThis project has 2 sub-projects: \"Drama\" and \"Sport\". Each sub-project's topic is carefully selected, in the purpose to cover the acquisition of a large amount of knowledge. As methodical approaches, those topics are treated using a wide range of pedagogical approaches: research activities, conferences, workshops, learning through art (artistic creations, songs, dramatization), e-journalism, educational games, sports, outdoor education. As a feed-back of learning we will use volunteering activities. Even the evaluation process is innovative, realized through educational games, workshops, dramatisation. Using the results of the project we will create new curricula taught as a non-formal teaching based on the place-based education.", "http://www.scarthojunior.co.uk", "Scartho Junior Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000351_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["2BA", "RJL", "Diana, Princess Of Wales Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN33"}
