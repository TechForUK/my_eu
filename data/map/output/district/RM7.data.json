Internationality and competence in modern foreign languages are an integral part of its school development plan.

Our 75 teachers teach 600 students aged between 14 and 21 years.

University College London advised and assisted us in this search. Representatives of both institutions have already made contact and met, and now our aim is to build up a long-term co-operation and start VET staff mobility. Our aim is to meet teaching staff and establish contacts for future projects in which we will possibly be able exchange students.Objectives of the projectOur project aim is to establish a co-operation with an educational institution that teaches the same age range on a comparable level of competence in the field of culinary arts and restaurant skills in a country where the target language English is spoken. One aim is to improve our target language competences and our teaching methods and tools in the field of CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and our target language English as a language of instruction in culinary arts and restaurant service skills including the social English that goes along with this. The project is also about an exchange of practice and best practice in subject specific content, knowledge and skills in the field of culinary arts and restaurant skills.

We also expect enhanced intercultural awareness in relation to internationality and the European dimension with all those involved in our school and college. At a regional level we want to disseminate the knowledge, skills and competences gained by the teachers taking part in this project in teacher training seminars.

It is highly unlikely that any of our participants will have completed an overseas work placement and therefore the 2 - 3 week mobility period is considered a realistic and attainable time frame for each group to gain valuable work experience, allowing a sufficient period for the participants to adjust to life in a new country as well gain a meaningful experience with the host organisations that will enable them to achieve their specific learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nAll of the project learners will agree a number of different Learning Outcomes at the start of their mobility, which reflect key skills, knowledge and work based competences that need to be achieved in order to obtain specific course units; learners will work towards achieving these Learning Outcomes during the 2 -3 week mobility period.\r\nAhead of commencing their mobility the learners will receive preparatory training in the UK. This will include some practically focused elements that will help to manage the learners expectations effectively, as well as assisting them with advice on suitable items to pack, such as suitable clothing.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will also benefit BDC staff, enabling them to increase their teaching competences as well as gaining a better understanding of the needs of employers, on a European level.", "http://www.bdc.ac.uk", "Barking & Dagenham College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-036166_coordinator"], ["0XU", "BDC European Work Experience Project", "Barking & Dagenham College", 995248.0, "This project will build on Barking & Dagenham College's (BDC) existing KA1 projects that have continued to increase in terms of the  breadth of vocational areas as well as the volume of international placements that we can offer our learners.\r\n\r\nThe project will offer 434 BDC learners with a work placement lasting between 2 - 3 weeks, during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 academic years. The project will also provide professional development opportunities for staff acting as Accompanying Persons within the project; our Accompanying Staff will support participants at a ratio of 1 staff member for every 10 students, with a total of 92 BDC staff members benefiting form these developmental opportunities during the project cycle. \r\nThis project will provide Mobility opportunities in the vocational areas of:\r\n\r\n- Business \r\n- ICT\r\n- Accounts\r\n- Construction\r\n- Hair & Beauty \r\n- Health & Social Care\r\n- Hospitality & Catering\r\n- Creative Industries\r\n- Engineering\r\n- Sports Coaching for our Football and Rugby Academies\r\n\r\nWe will send our participants to work with Hosting Organisations in France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Portugal and the Greek island of Crete. Details of student flows, target countries and vocational areas are detailed below:\r\n\r\nThe Accounts department will send a total of 40 participants to complete a mobility in the Czech Republic, they will send two cohorts per year (groups of 20) over 2 years, travelling for 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Engineering department will send 30 students to Seville, Spain in two cohorts of 15 during the two year project cycle, travelling for 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Creative & Cultural Industries department will send a total of 70 students to complete a mobility in Spain, in two cohorts of 35 over the two academic years, travelling for 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Rugby Academy will send a 46 students to Perpignan, France in two cohorts of 23 over the two academic years, travelling for 2 weeks.  \r\n \r\nThe following groups of students will travel only in the second year of this project (the 2019/20 academic year):\r\n\r\nThe Construction department will send a total of 60 students from several construction sub-sectors (Electrical, Plumbing, Painting & Decorating and the Built Environment), travelling for 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe ICT department will send 50 participants and the Business department will send 40 participants to Prague, both cohorts travelling for 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Hair & Beauty department will send 35 learners to Crete to complete a 2 week work placement\r\n\r\nThe Health & Social care department will 20 students to Esposende, Portugal, travelling for 2 weeks \r\n\r\nThe Football academy will send two cohorts of 14 students to Seville, Spain\r\n\r\nThe Hospitality & Catering Department will send their students to Seville, Spain for 2 weeks\r\n\r\nBy participating in a Mobility, participants will gain the opportunity to build on the training that they have received in BDC as part of their vocational course of study. The placement will provide participants with a number of benefits that include: gaining the opportunity to gain real work experience within a professional environment,  increase their personal and soft skills as well as the independence and confidence that come from living in a foreign country.\r\nAll participants will have gained key knowledge, skills and competences from their college qualification; the mobility experience will add value to the learners' studies through the provision of a practical element that will increase their employability and significantly improve their chances of obtaining sustainable employment at the end of their studies.\r\n\r\nAll of the mobility opportunities that we offer will last between 2 - 3 weeks, we believe that this is a realistic and attainable time frame for each group to gain valuable work experience; it also enables course tutors to structure course delivery accordingly, so that participants will not miss out on valuable classroom time, which is required in order for them to fulfill their vocational qualification.\r\n\r\nAll participants will work with their tutor to address a specific unit from their course; the units will be divided in to Learning Outcomes and recorded within a Learning Agreement, which will be referred to throughout the mobility and will guide the participants' learning objectives. \r\nAll participants will receive some preparatory training in the UK before they travel which will include some practically focused elements that will help to manage the learners expectations effectively, as well as assisting them with advice on suitable items to pack, such as suitable clothing. Participants will also be encouraged to access the OLS course to support the development of their linguistic skills.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will also benefit BDC staff, enabling them to increase their teaching competences as well as gaining a better understanding of the needs of employers, at European level.", "http://www.bdc.ac.uk", "Barking & Dagenham College", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-046949_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "RM7"}
