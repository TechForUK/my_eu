The goal of the project is to enable operating with developed iso-modular logistics units of sizes adequate for real modal and co-modal flows of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), providing a basis for an interconnected logistics system for 2030.\nModulushca integrates five interrelated working fields: (1) developing a vision addressing the user needs for interconnected logistics in the FMCG domain, (2) the development of a set of exchangeable (ISO) modular logistics units providing a building block of smaller units, (3) establishing digital interconnectivity of the units, (4) development of an interconnected logistics operations platform leading to a significant reduction in costs and CO2 emissions that will be (5) demonstrated in two implementation pilots for interconnected solutions.\nModulushca will establish a robust and replicable methodology to develop and evaluate solutions for interconnected logistics looking at other elements of the supply chain. Two implementation pilots will be executed integrating key Modulushca developments in significantly different supply chains: (1) a closed pilot evaluating the benefits on a inter-site supply chain addressing handling and transportation of iso-modular logistics units within one company, and (2) an open network pilot will evaluate the impact of iso-modular logistics units in cross docking and transshipment processes.\nModulushca efforts will lead to the development of a road map towards a fully interconnected logistics system in 2030. The road map will address the changes and necessary steps to change the logistics system gradually, exploiting progresses in digital, physical and operational interconnectivity, building on current players, assets and infrastructures.", 121598.0, 3304546.0, "MODULUSHCA", "A logistics system modelled on the Web", "The EU-funded project MODULUSHCA provides a comprehensive set of concepts and developments towards a digital, operational and physical interconnected worldwide logistics network.", "At the moment, only very few freight carriers are cooperating with competitors.

Just like information can be sent through the open routes of the Web, consumer goods could arrive at their destination in a shared worldwide logistics network.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Modular logistics units in shared co-modal networks' (http://www.modulushca.eu/ (MODULUSHCA)) has researched the methodological, functional components towards a Physical Internet and developed and tested first applications.\n\nTo enable competitors to share their infrastructure and make full use of the transport assets, a special set of modular boxes (M-Boxes) was developed, produced and tested under real life conditions. Box specifications aiming towards a standardisation, such as a collapsing functionalities or panel design, have been assessed, included and realised. Innovative production methodologies such as 3D printing are employed for prototyping. Together with other prototypes of different box sizes, \u201cLEGO\u201d-type building blocks for shipments have been produced, digitally connected to each other and included in an overall IT Architecture.

Our pedagogy of alternation has always accustomed students to have different work placements in various professional backgrounds. It is therefore quite natural that we decided to set up internships for European mobility. Our training centre has organized European mobility programmes since 2008. Two kinds of public are primarily concerned: students in second year of Bac Pro SAPAT (services to people and territories) for a 3-week placement, and students in 2nd year of CAP \"cooking and waitressing\" (with the apprentice status) for an internship of two weeks negotiated with their tutors when they signed  their apprenticeship contract (one week taken on the company time and one week on the training centre time).The idea today is rooted in the minds and represents a real motivation for the majority of learners although some families still need to be convincing. In mountain areas, mobility needs to be developed indeed...We stayed on the idea of a much anticipated preparation.(pj 2) When our students join the class of \"Seconde\", we talk to the families and to the students. Students meet young people who have already benefited from this program. We begin to raise funds to complete the exchange. When they are in 2nd year , a cultural preparation work begins with dedicated time. (See work schedule). Families are associated to the process ( pj 10)From 2008 to 2013, we set up a support by a trainer throughout the stay. Since 2014, we have tested the organization of mobility without the presence of a trainer but with a \"referent\" person in the host country. This system works fairly well even though our work placement mentors expressed frustration not to meet with us for intermediate and final assessments. We have thus decided to develop the following plan for the majority of our next mobility programmes: a trainer from our centre will handle the first days of the stay and so a first contact with the work placement mentors will be done.Then our referent contact in the corrersponding country will take care of the rest of the stay. This principle explains the number of professional mobilities requested in this application. During their free-time, our students will also be supervised by that referent person (living near) who can act in case of troubles.The number of scholarships requested is down compared to 2014, being in an area in demographic decline, our class numbers are down.Each mobility is therefore subject to a review to re-examine our practices and enable us to progress in the Erasmus+ program management  in the future.Mobility in Ireland is a new thing. A trainer colleague will spend 5 days at the Dublin Institute of Technology (from February 1st to 5th, 2016) as part of the European mobility programme for professionnals and he will try to make new contacts for both the food sector and personal services.As the history of our project shows, in 2012, we established groups of mobility for professional tutors, first trainer of the \"food\" sector in 2012 to discover the professional training and work organization in Swedish restaurants. This experience was renewed for 10 tutors and trainer of the \"early childhood\" sector in January 2015 to explore early childhood care in the Swedish system. (pj 3) Given the value of these experiences for adults and actual professional repercussions, it is expected in the next application (2017) to set up a stay for cooks in Ireland and to involve our Swedish partners in that project. A committee of our Board of Directors will start thinking about that project next March so as to be able to apply for 2017..2 other trainer colleagues have recently expressed a desire to experience an individual professional mobility  (Elise CAILLIAU in 2016/2017 and in 2017/2018 Jerome MONTAVON) one in Ireland and one in Scotland. Their goals are professional immersions in high schools to exchange with colleagues. After these two stays are completed, this will be 100% of the members of the teaching team which will have benefited from European professional mobility.

It is simply not enough to just USE technology (such as Apps, Youtube, Google Docs) in the classroom,  teachers have to make EFFECTIVE use of such technologies.\r\n\r\nAfter a transparent and open internal application process  a small group of staff (9 - comprising six subject areas, the whole Psychology department, 3 members of SLT, 2 Heads of Department and the Headteacher - some roles overlap) were selected to take part in the project.  However, as the school gained much experience from the previously successful Comenius project, it is widely recognised that this small group of teachers will be truly representative of the staff as a whole.  We endeavour to ensure that all staff will benefit from the project whether or not they themselves travelled.\r\n\r\nWe have identified that a way to enhance teachers skills in this area is to afford them the opportunity to watch other practitioners doing so with their own students.  To this end two members of one of RMS's most effective departments will jobshadow colleagues in Finland - chosen because of its high PISA rankings. This will be a reciprocated visit as we will host the Finnish teachers as part of their own separate, unrelated project application.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we feel the need to learn about new,cutting edge technology applications and so we will send colleagues to attend a course that will cover this.

AGian this course has been selected because it fits our needs perfectly.\r\n\r\nUltimately we will use what we learn to enable our students to make more effective use of the technological skills they will need for their future careers.  They are already adept and confident computer users, with their digital skills being well-honed, but this project will ensure that they are able to utilise these skills in much more effective and efficient ways.

By combining the experiences of all elements of this project we hope that we will be able to encourage students will be able to share their collaborative work on a more widespread basis.\r\n\r\nWe will present our finding through a variety of channels, most notably subject-specific journals, seminars and workshops.

This process helps learners to be come much more independent and in so doing put them in charge of their own learning. \r\n\r\nAll of these benefits are in line with our school ethos whereby each child is esteemed as an individual, capable of success and encouraged to do their personal best.", "http://www.royalmasonic.herts.sch.uk", "Royal Masonic School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036405_coordinator"], ["1AQ", "European Mobility and Training Increase the Opportunities for New-jobs", "RSPCA Shop Rickmansworth", 129410.0, "Investments in education and professional training for skills development are essential to stimulate the economic growth and competitiveness: skills determine Europe's ability to increase productivity. A report of the European Commission from 2012 proposes \"Rethinking of Education: investing in skills for better socio-economic outcomes\". This process is necessary because by 2020, 20% of new jobs will require skills at a higher level, and education must raise both the standards and the levels of achievement to fulfil this requirement and to encourage transversal skills necessary to ensure that young people are able to become free entrepreneurs and adapt to the inevitable changes, which are becoming more numerous, in the labor market during their career. In this perspective, the project EMOTION aims as objectives:\r\nO1- Increase the quality of teaching and learning by improving the skills of management and leadership of training  for a total number of 7 VET teachers participating in activities of shadowing type in Granada, during 7 days\r\nO2 - Improvement of the quality of professional training of 64 students (in 4 streams) from the fields of qualification Commerce/Trading and Tourism, participants in practice training sessions of 14 days, at economic agents  in the UK - London, between 2017-2019, in order to facilitate insertion on the labor market for future graduates\r\nO3 \u2013 Increase the capacity of a total number of 80 teachers and 1200 students from VET to trigger changes at the school level, in terms of modernization and international openness by strengthening the European dimension of the educational and professional training process, until 2020.\r\nThe project addresses to students and teachers in VET: 7 teachers will participate in direct observation by job shadowing, of the way the management and leadership of training is approached in an innovative manner, in a prestigious school in Granada, and will benefit of transfer of good practices and advice in this field; 64 students of XI th grades will participate in practical training sessions in four streams-placement  at economic agents in the UK, to improve professional skills, during two years, as follows: Stream 1 - Feb. 2018 practical training (9 pupils, Commerce, 7 pupils - Tourism) and 2 accompanying teachers.

After 2 years of experience as a Consortium, the strategy of internationalization of the VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE (CFA) has improved and continues to adapt to everybody\u2019s needs.\r\n\r\nOur Consortium also got bigger and the number of mobilities almost doubled.

The agricultural and horticultural regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE consists of 20 UFA. Every UFA is also constituent center of an EPLEFPA most of the time. Among the 10 members of the Consortium we count as many UFA as High schools and EPLEFPA. This variety of profiles explains that we make demands of mobility for mixed audience (learning and initial training) who have a common route of training. Our project grows richer year after year and the European culture, the exchange of practices, propagate in all these organizations.\r\n\r\n7 institutions composed our Consortium 2015-2017; 3 new UFA have joined the project involving new partners (Spain, the United Kingdom). Therefore, a total of 10 institutions participate in this Consortium EFP for 2017-2019. These 10 institutions have decided to get together to mutualize the initiatives, coordinate the actions, to unite the work force, the technical skills and to benefit from a shared financial management. Mobility resource teams (an education-administration binome task force per institution) are associated to the development of the project to determine orientation, the general and specific objectives, strategy... They are the link between the Regional VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE and the mobilities in every institution.\r\n\r\nThe objective is more than ever to develop and to strengthen individual mobility in these establishments, with a growing demand from the learners, their families and the professional partners. Indeed, the discovery of new skill techniques, the improvement of the foreign language level, the opening to the European citizenship, the improved autonomy in the work field and in everyday life are so many assets approved by all the actors of the mobility.\r\n\r\nThe Consortium II EFP project will be spread out over two years (2017-2019) to facilitate the pedagogy of alternating qualification courses: so according to the seasonality of the sectors and the rhythms of alternation of the UFA, each of them, with the cooperation of the French employers, can schedule the departures of learners, trainers, members of the teams and the associated professionals.\r\nFor the learners, establishments propose mobilities in a company for two or three weeks in agreement with the French employers. This duration provides enough time for the learner to become integrated into the host company and to discover new techniques without penalizing the French employer in his professional activity.\r\n\r\nThe staffs, as for them, will leave from 2 to 7 days for mobility in training centers and partner companies. \r\n154 apprentices and 37 accompanying persons will leave for mobility in Italy, Germany, Romania and Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Spain, The United Kingdom, Ireland \u2026: back to France, they will use the observations made in the partner country, to present their life in a company but also their everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis year we have developed the chapter \"scattering\" and \"valuation\" to take advantage of these experiences to speak about the project. Furthermore, we have launched a more elaborate quality approach to be sure of the relevance of the project and to maintain a reflexive approach.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, profits are multiple: an enrichment of the professional practices for the apprentices and the staffs, an interest generated within the teams and the learners around international exchanges, intercultural exchanges, valuation of the various actors involved in the project, which already impact on the participating establishments.", "http://www.threerivers.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036978_1"], ["1RL", "Consortium III EFP CFA R\u00e9gional Agricole", "Three Rivers District Council", 148264.0, "The Regional Agricultural Rhone-Alpes CFA is a \u201coff wall CFA\u201d, which consists of 20 centers called UFA throughout the territory.\r\nThe Regional CFA is a constituent of the EPL of Lyon-Dardilly-Ecully.
