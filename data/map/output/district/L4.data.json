We currently teach MFL in Key Stage 2; our aim is to integrate MFL throughout our school, from Nursery to Year 6, therefore we have applied for a grant to fund European Mobility as a project to enhance: \r\n- Language skills\r\n- Subject leadership \r\n- Understanding of European dimension \r\n- Planning, teaching and assessment of MFL which, in turn, will develop staff confidence and competency in relation to MFL. \r\n\r\nThese areas for development where chosen, in line with new curriculum guidance, as we want to integrate MFL securely within our setting; allowing children to develop fluency in their language skills, cultural awareness and the ability to write in a foreign language applicable to their level. In a bid to motivate our children to be more culturally accepting and improve their writing, by providing a purpose (a whole school agenda), we are planning to make European Links with a school in France. We believe that this link will develop positive attitudes towards MFL and encourage our pupils to continue learning a language in later education. All of these aims were realised through Performance Management Meetings, staff discussions and our School Development Agenda. Our staff believes that learning a language enriches the curriculum and creates enthusiastic learners (and teachers) as a result of providing excitement and challenge.\r\n\r\nBefore the participant selection process, our newly appointed MFL coordinator expressed a strong desire, by forwarding on their interests to the Head Teacher and selection committee, to take part in the language training in France. It was decided that this participant would be best suited to the course as they displayed a high level of motivation and interest in developing their language skills and gaining confidence to lead this subject \u2013 in relation to supporting other staffs\u2019 CPD, planning, teaching and assessing - in the direction our school expects MFL to take. We believe that PQ-France was the best course to allow our MFL coordinator to develop these areas for progression. During this course the participant will embark on language training suited to their level of competency, along with gaining an insight into European dimension and pedagogy and methodology in this area. They will develop a European school link that will provide the participant with one-to-one connections allowing them to further build upon speaking and listening skills, fluency and confidence. \r\n\r\nFollowing on from the training there will be a forum for discussion around the changes that will impact on MFL in our setting. The introduction of new schemes of work, as a result of careful planning and focus on progression, will be shared with all staff and this will be expected to impact on the teaching, planning and assessment of MFL within our setting. A new MFL policy outlining the areas that our school must focus on (teaching and cultural awareness) will be drawn up and discussed with governors and the curriculum committee within our setting. To ensure that these changes are impacting in the way we envisaged we plan learning walks, observations, auditing of resources, pupils interviews and Performance Management Meetings to take place; allowing the MFL coordinator, HT and SLT to monitor the schools development in relation to MFL. Time will also be provided for the MFL coordinator to provide in house training to staff wishing to develop their own language skills and fluency. \r\n\r\nWe envisage that participating in this project will allow our school to revise and strengthen the professional profile of our staff through targeted support and training, therefore impacting on our approach to MFL. Through creating a European link we will address our area for development in relation to teaching - especially developing children's cultural awareness and acceptance. New schemes of work will benefit our curriculum greatly \u2013 ensuring that all pupils are stimulated and challenged. Finally, our organisation intends to reach out to many people through this project, to develop cultural awareness and language, namely: staff, governors, pupils and parents who will gain immensely from a new found enthusiasm towards MFL that our setting will develop. \r\nIn summary, we at Kirkdale St Lawrence, believe that this project has long term benefits for our school and will provide our staff and pupils with the opportunities to:\r\n- Confidently express themselves in a foreign language; \r\n- Explore their own cultural identities and those if others;\r\n- Discover and apply strategies to improve their learning of MFL;\r\n- Apply and develop their knowledge of language and language learning creatively;\r\n- Gain enjoyment, pride and a sense of achievement, within MFL;\r\n- Approach the teaching and learning of MFL with a new found vivacity.", "http://www.kirkdale.liverpool.sch.uk", "Kirkdale St Lawrence CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001898_coordinator"], ["0TH", "Liverpool FC Apprenticeship Enhancement & Exit and Progression Opportunities", "Liverpool Football Club and Athletics Grounds Ltd", 67320.0, "CONTEXT\r\n\r\nLiverpool Football Club (LFC) is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England. The main aim of the club's Academy is to scout and develop players who will potentially reach professional status. However, regardless of the level of success achieved in football, Apprentices receive advice and education that provide a solid platform from which they can move forward and make sound decisions in life. The framework for this education is the Advanced Apprentice in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme, a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people with the realistic potential to achieve excellence in sport. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at LFC. Working with host partner Deutsch-Tschechische Fussballschule (DTFS) in Germany, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the LFC AASE programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing Apprentices to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip Apprentices with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 32 (male) Apprentices undertaking the LFC AASE programme in the 2016/17 football season (i.e. the 2015 and 2016 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their football ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will be delivered/facilitated by DTFS, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality German youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nDTFS has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable LFC to enhance the work placement activities of participants.

We want to make our school an example of excellent languages teaching to inspire other schools within our city, build our internationalism further and develop more international links to motivate and encourage our pupils, show them the importance of language learning, open their minds to other cultures and give them the opportunities that they may otherwise be lacking. We want all of our staff to feel a high level of confidence in the teaching of French. We want to focus particularly on intensively training two key members of staff to the extent that they are not only able to provide excellent teaching themselves, but are equipped with the skills and confidence to pass this on to the rest of our staff and also to other schools within our area. We want to develop innovative teaching strategies like CLIL and to share our own successful strategies with others in Europe, such as the involvement of footballers from LFC to raise pupil attainment in reading in both French and English.We want to increase extracurricular provision, further develop our links with local businesses, improve literacy through the teaching of languages and further develop our early years language provision.We plan to up skill two key members of staff so that they are able to provide exemplary teaching and also act as a source of support and training for others through a series of two immersion courses in Rouen in France involving intensive language learning, cultural activities, language teaching methodology, focused discussions and a placement in a French primary school.The two courses are progressive and the second builds on the learning of the first with a task in between. We believe that this approach will be very effective in giving our two key members of staff a huge boost in their confidence and skills, meaning that they are in a much better position to be able to support others in our school. The participants would then develop a series of training opportunities for the rest of the staff, and new materials and training packages which can be shared with colleagues across the city through our status as a teaching school.The links developed with the French school will help to build on our internationalism and allow us to develop projects and activities with our pupils involving joint working and communication on a regular basis, and in the long term, we intend to be involved in pupil exchanges with our link French school.The new ideas picked up from the course and shared within the school will allow us to develop our CLIL provision and increase cross curricular work and the European dimension. Through injecting new ideas and strategies, we will continue to build on our staff enthusiasm and motivation which will motivate our pupils and allow us to provide even better support to other schools within our network.Our school prides itself on bringing new, unique life experiences to its pupils, many of whom come from deprived social backgrounds.  We feel language learning brings such a huge array of benefits to our pupils not just linguistically but culturally and gives them an insight to opportunities that they otherwise may never experience.  By taking on new projects such as this, our school\u2019s profile and our commitment to international links and language learning is evermore highlighted and valued by others.  There will be an impact on the professional development of all our staff leading to better future career opportunities. There will be a major increase in their confidence and the benefits will be passed beyond our school through the training we will develop and the materials we will produce. Being part of the North Liverpool Teaching School\u2019s Partnership we will have the opportunity to showcase our project and findings to other schools in the area.  In the past we have always welcomed teachers from other cultures to visit our school and share practice and ideas.  This project would lend itself brilliantly to this as we would welcome any new friends /colleagues from abroad to visit our school and gain an insight into our teaching, methodology and attitudes to learning. As  \u2018French Centre Of Excellence \u2018 (awarded to us in June 2015) we are often called upon by local organisations to contribute to CPD events and small cluster meetings.
