Our Sports Academy programme for young adults aged 16-18 years old combines full-time education with sporting excellence and is delivered in partnership with 65 professional and amateur clubs. The Football Academy is open to aspiring players, coaches and referees aged 16-18 and aims to equip students with the skills and experience to progress into education or employment within sport via a formal, full-time training programme. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to enhance the vocational and professional development of students undertaking our Football Academy programme. Working with host partner Sportilia in Italy, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the SCL Football Academy programme and our students.\r\n\r\n2. Exposing participants to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3. Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip participants with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nThere are over 2,000 Football Academy students across 65 programmes throughout the UK. In line with our company mission, the programme is aimed at students from all walks of life, allowing anyone with a passion for sport to gain the vocational qualifications they need to pursue a sporting career leading to employment, Further and Higher Education. Students therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds. Participants for this project will be selected from circa 300 students at eight Surrey-based programmes in the 2018/2019 academic year.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will take place at the Sportilia facility, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Italian youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nSportilia will use its links at a local, regional and national level to enable SCL to enhance the project activities. For example:\r\n- Access to top flight Italian football teams.\r\n- Work shadowing opportunities to provide exposure to alternative careers.\r\n- Observation of a live Serie A fixture. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nWe will draw on the experience and influence of Project Management team to implement robust project management processes at each stage of project delivery, including:\r\n\r\n1) PREPARATION: contracting information, site visit, Memorandum of Understanding, Logistics Contact, Communications Plan, Dissemination Plan, financial arrangements, health and safety requirements, information and guidance for participants, preparation pack, preparation sessions.\r\n\r\n2) DELIVERY: mentoring, assessment, integration, gathering of evidence of formal and informal learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n3) EVALUATION: participant feedback, host partner feedback, evaluation report, validation and recognition of learning.\r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Progress against recognised vocational qualifications. \r\n- Development of skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on SCL are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the Football Academy programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the SCL Football Academy programme and also our wider education programmes.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for students, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://wearescl.co.uk/", "SCL Education and Training Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047035_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU47"}
