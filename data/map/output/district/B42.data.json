It seems this issue can only be addresses through a bid for EU-funding from Erasmus+ on the basis of the cooperation with a tertiary education institution abroad. A similar perspective for designers in the crafts sector, to be admitted to an academic course does currently not exist in Germany. The Birmingham City University has already admitted graduates from the academy of design (chamber if crafts) on numerous occasions in the past. The wide portfolio of study courses of the Institute of Art and Design of the Birmingham City University offers perfect conditions for this project. As the chosen participants belong among the best of their year, they will be chosen according to their past performance. A further qualification abroad will prepare them for leadership tasks in Bavarian crafts enterprises, foundation of a company and network building with international customers. Through conceptioning and implementation of own design-projects the participants will learn to employ and broaden their acquired knowledge and skills. Network-building to an internationally active milieu of designers will open all perspectives to the participants to compete in this environment. \r\nDuring their stay, the participants will be enrolled in a twelve month course in the field of art and design and attend compulsory as well as optional subjects, combining theory, practice and research. The acquired competencies will be tested and evaluated in the Master's thesis. \r\nAt the level of upper Bavaria and nationally, this project will have a significant impact on the skilled crafts sector itself, as the targeted dissemination of result will yield an image gain. The impact on the participants will be to educate them possessing leadership skills, skills in founding an own design company and international product marketing skills, which will prove as valuable benefits in a very competitive market. In the long-term, this will increase the permeability of the education system nationally and on a European level as well as serve as a model-project to strengthen the compatibility between vocational and academic education.", "http://www.bcu.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000326_1"], ["2LR", "Development and evaluation of guide-models mass athletics for sports in students with special needs (obese, disabled persons etc.)", "HEALTH EXERCISE AND ACTIVITY THERAPY EMA INTERVENTIONS CIC", 304405.0, "In modern societies, the role of exercise is important in maintaining and improving the body weight of the individual and the general improvement of health, as well. The student population, due to the many hours and perennial studies on the acquisition of knowledge, has recently presented physical inactivity, poor dietary habits and wrong attitude of daily life. All the above has led to a dramatic increase of the obesity worldwide in major developed and developing countries.  Recent studies published, reveal that over the last 20 years in America, there was a sharp decrease in physical activity and an increase in average body mass index (BMI), while the calorie intake has remained constant. The researchers, among others, consider that a decrease in physical activity during leisure time at national level, especially among young adults (18-39 years), may be responsible for the upward trend in obesity rates.  Also, another group of students (disabled) are in the most of the Universities around Europe excluded from common sports as there are no guidelines to use for the training of these sports.For these reasons, it is recommended that sport federations/sports unions/sports houses to develop guidelines, models  and rules of good practice focusing on mass athletics and the education of students/trainers/clubs for the  prevention of sport exclusion of students with these special needs. It also encourages the networking of  Universities and and national agencies on these issues at the European level. The project will develop and evaluate these models across different European countries in order to provide deliverables that could be used around Europe.", "http://www.heat.org", null, "erasmus_579917-EPP-1-2016-2-EL-SPO-SCP_7"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B42"}
