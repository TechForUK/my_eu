Especially students who need the possibility to apply theoretical knowledge after finishing their studies and people who find themselves in a situation of prolonged unemployment can be involved in a project where they can develop their skills and acquire new ones that could be useful to them in future job applications.Activities and benefits throughout the Project:Working outdoors; development on a personal level; learning two languages; enhancing personal skills; establishing relations with volunteers with a different socio-cultural background; believing, working and fighting for a common cause (Primate and biodiversity conservation and fight for a better world). They will establish an active role in society and eventually they will get to understand and acquire empathy towards disadvantaged and/or abused humans and nonhuman animals, as well as learn to cooperate with others and to work as a Team, gaining skills to improve their chances to work in professional organisations.The partner organizations WILD FUTURES, from England, BEIT BEN YEHUDA, from Israel and CONCORDIA from France, will participate on this Project. The three organizations have very much experience on international volunteer projects, education and supporting youth and community development. Therefore none of the three have much more experience than us on Erasmus + Program. Our objectives, actions and needs related to this Program and the Project are:-Providing a chance in professional development, training and gaining experience to young people participating as volunteers.-Offering an opportunity for people with a disadvantage due to lacking financial assistance, who otherwise could never engage in such a long-term experience.-Promoting the exchange of volunteers from other countries, offering a cultural, linguistic and on a personal level enriching experiences.-Improving the capabilities and skills of young people, because we believe that the future generations should have a greater social and environmental commitment in order to respect and protect the environment.-Helping the participants to grow as individuals.- Improving cooperation between countries and organizations- Young participants will play an active role in the implementation of the tasks listed or proposed in this project. We wish to stimulate our volunteers and give them the possibility to work creatively in the development of the different activities. After the experience they are supposed to play an active role in society and keep promoting the Program. In short, we want volunteers to feel comfortable, confident, motivated and proud to belong to the Project.The three Activities planned as part of this Project are: To receive three long-term volunteer staying 12 months under the European Volunteer service.  The main objective on the Program is to encourage the exchange between young people and provide them with a training possibility or a non-formal training under a Project about the impact on the environment. For this Project we have chosen the following volunteers:Activity 1- SAMANTHA WILKINSON, English women of 23rd  years oldActivity 2- ASSAF CHIPROUT, Israelian man of 24th years oldActivity 3- N\u00c0DEGE COUTOLLEAU, French women of 24th years oldAs a first impact, we expect that our volunteers will have fulfilled their primary objectives, improving their language skills as well as improving their capacity, learning a new profession during their time at MONA. At the same time they will fill out and complete their Youthpass, self-evaluating its parameters which will help them as a certificate of the non-formal training. We hope they will see this time as a rewarding experience apart of the benefits and advantages provided from Erasmus + Program. The multi-cultural experience, and the non-formal training and the achieved objectives are expected to be a rewarding experience for the participants motivating them to share, promote and spread the word with friends, family and other potential volunteers.We hope to create an impact and spread the word about the Project throughout the public, promoting it to visitors at the centre, supporters of MONA and all followers and subscribers via mailing and social media networks.We expect also believe on the \u201cmouth to mouth communication\u201d, from the participants and other volunteers who will explain to family, friends, visitors and students who are not yet part of the Project, where could result  future participants.We will publish and promote the Program in the media, presenting as well the logo Erasmus+ on our Education Room.", "http://www.wildfutures.org/", null, "erasmus_2016-2-ES02-KA105-008473_1"], ["1NZ", "Primate Volunteer", "Wild Futures", 31746.0, "Wild Futures project aims to encourage socially excluded young people and people who have never encountered other cultures, due to geographical or economical barriers, and empower them with professional skills in the animal welfare sector.

A very good level of English is also required for health and safety reasons, including working around dangerous animals, but also required when educating the public. Volunteers have the opportunity to focus their project on a specific area of interest in the organisation which include; primate care, PR and fundraising, education, maintenance and sustainability, and volunteer management.

The long-term voluntary work will focus on helping exotic wildlife which ended up as victims of illegal or inconsiderate human actions.  The work will be executed in two rescue and rehabilitations centers, being AAP in Almere, the Netherlands and its Spanish branch Primadomus in Villena, Spain. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the voluntary work is executed at two locations, it includes similar activities. Receiving international volunteers with AAP, Almere, the Netherlands is in fact prolongation of earlier successful EVS-projects. The selected volunteers are animal, nature and/or environment motivated young people, by coincidence both coming from Denmark. They will spent their EVS-time within teams of great diversity: paid staff next to many interns and volunteers, colleagues of all levels of education and about 10-15 European nationalities. Through meeting their peers from other countries and of different background they can explore and create an understanding of each other\u2019s cultures and values. Mutually, this will lead to a greater solidarity and tolerance. \r\nThe second location of the project is Primadomus in Spain, participating in EVS since 2014. To safeguard a solid rollout of the project, we have chosen for support and coordination from AAP's headquarters in the Netherlands, accepting the temporal consequence that only Dutch volunteers can take part.\r\n\r\nIn this project we aim on young people from all over Europe. With their involvement in the daily caretaking process, both NGO's will gain important basic support in their labor intensive daily work. The volunteers will increase their awareness and insight in issues of animal welfare. In a charity setting and together with many other European volunteers, they will help animals in need but also get better understanding of underlying problems. The volunteers will learn  skills, attitude and knowledge necessary for animal caretaking, but also gain general life, social and intercultural experience. As most of them have background or career plans involving animals, it's likely that their EVS-experience at AAP or Primadomus improves their chances on the labor market. On long term, as they regularly remain involved with NGO's in their home countries, they also help spreading attention to animal welfare issues internationally.\r\nAlso internally, the receiving organisations will 'profit' from the project. Through intensive contact and long-term involvement of the volunteers, the staff comes into contact with diversity of ideas and habits from different European nations and cultures. This will contribute to better understanding of cultural differences and widen their social horizon as well.\r\n\r\nDuring their EVS year, at both AAP Almere and Primadomus the volunteers will actively take part in the caretaking process of different exotic species in the rescue center. They will work in a team of experienced animal caretakers and will be trained to carry out activities independently. They will change departments/positions in order to maximize their experience.  After initial phase of the project, the volunteers will be also offered opportunity to acquire some experience within other parts of AAP/Primadomus (Animal transport, Fundraising, Prevention, Education etc.); the specific possibilities are dependent on the volunteer\u2019s abilities, interests and attitudes but also on practical possibilities and needs of the organisation. Next to their work directly linked to animal care, the volunteers will be also offered language support and they will be involved in daily running of the volunteers' accommodation, which will help them to improve their managerial skills as well.", "http://www.wildfutures.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NL02-KA105-001565_3"], ["1NZ", "Wildlife Rescue", "Wild Futures", 22970.0, "Context/background of the project\r\nCultural diversity: The \"Wildlife Rescue\" has been developed as a project that will enable interaction, activism, education and creativity, whilst allowing the volunteer's personal growth and increase her career opportunities in the future. A wildlife hospital is an unusual place with special needs and atmosphere run by mostly volunteers. We want to give not only local but also international volunteers with interests in wildlife rescue the possibility to get unique experiences. An international volunteer can have a different point of view in these matters, which can be refreshing for the local volunteers. Many of our staff and volunteers had in the past good contacts with international organizations and people abroad. This was one of the extra motivations to start with the project. Thus, wildlife hospital will be this project's working location in order to stimulate the resource to a working environment that not only contributes from the volunteer's own interests and knowledge but also allows her personal growth and realization as an active participant. We work with all kinds of different volunteers: students, older people, people with disabilities, EVS-volunteers from different countries, staffmembers, and even people with an alternative punishment. So they get to know all the different layers of people in our population, and so they will understand that our world is a place with a huge cultural diversity.\r\n\r\nGlobal environmental challenges: Due to the growing human population, the pressure on the environment is getting bigger and bigger. That means  that in our centre, the number of animals in need is getting higher and higher. By working in our centre, the EVS-volunteers will learn that the global impact of our population is too big, and that changes our needed. Our centre tries to help those animals that have become a victim of human expansion.\r\nDue to climate changes, we see a difference in the animals we get. Another problem is also the way people treat animals. We have a lot of problems with Seagulls in the centre of the city. Due to loss of their natural breeding territory, the gulls have moved to the city, and breed there. People don\u2019t like it, and try to take the eggs and young gulls away. This is a big problem, where our Rescue Centre is trying to find a solution for. With several campaigns, flyers and activities, we try to tell people why the gulls have moved, and what to do to avoid an overpopulation and problems in the city. Also EVS will deal with this problems, and can help to avoid problems.We try to learn our EVS about the environmental problems in Ostend and the complete country. So they do not only start knowing our culture, but also our vision on the environment and nature. \r\n\r\nInclusion of young people with fewer opportunities: One of the objectives of this project is to promote Inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities. In this project we will give the opportunity to 2 volunteers with fewer opportunities to volunteer in the Wildlife Rescue Centre.  Because of European Voluntary Service the 2 volunteers can do this volunteer project; without EVS there is no possibility of getting in contact with our culture and our centre.  Travelling is too expensive for the volunteers.  They come from a geographical disadvantaged area with a high unemployment rate where they don\u2019t get a lot of opportunities.\r\n\r\nSummary of the project: 3 long-term and 2 short-term volunteers in the EVS project \"Wildlife Rescue\" has resulted from the collaboration between the 4 different sending organizations and the Wildlife Rescue Centre Ostend (\"Opvangcentrum voor Vogels en Wilde Dieren Oostende\"). \r\nThe \"Wildlife Rescue\" has been developed as a project that will enable interaction, activism, education and creativity, whilst allowing the volunteer's personal growth and increase her career opportunities in the future. A wildlife hospital is an unusual place with special needs and atmosphere run by mostly volunteers. We want to give not only local but also international volunteers with interests in wildlife rescue the possibility to get unique experiences. \r\n\r\nDescription: Every season we can offer different groups/species of animals and their related problems.

Additional activities are specific to their project area and included but not restricted to:\r\n     \r\nLong term placement in Retail and Cafe;\r\n                                                           \r\n-Assist with opening preparations for the cafe and shop,\r\n-Help serve visitors\r\n-Help create and assist with onsite events at the cafe\r\n-Aid with public presentation on the ethos of the sanctuary to the visiting public.\r\n\r\nLong term placement in Maintenance and sustainability\r\n\r\n-Help design and implement recycling displays and interactive workshops. \r\n-Help in the maintenance of the Sanctuary infrastructure.\r\n-Contribute and expand the Wild Futures sustainability mission, through the implementation of greener systems such as  biomass heating system, solar panels, water capture .\r\n\r\nLong term placement in Education;\r\n\r\n-International Skype calls to schools\r\n-Organizing and attending onsite and off site events\r\n-Maintaining education rooms.\r\n-Group tours and children's parties.\r\n\r\nAll short term placements.\r\n\r\n- Assist keepers with work in monkey enclosures\r\n-Aid administrative staff when office tasks need completing\r\n-Assist in the education and campaigns department when needed.\r\n\r\nWorking methods will include outdoor and indoor activities, shadowing their supervisor is one learning technique which will be used in addition to demonstrations, presentation, self learning, group and independent work. We expect that all volunteers having left the project to have gained various skills which can be used in the animal welfare sector, when applying for more volunteering opportunities, internships, formal education or employment. Not only this, volunteers will have acquired or improved social skills adding diversity to their abilities. We foresee volunteers performing their civic duty by dispersing, teaching and education these new skills in their local communities.

In the 1970s, Mike Reynolds (an American architect) dreamt up this concept in Taos in the desert of New Mexico, USA. The \u00c4erdsch\u00ebff project is CELL's flagship project that involves adapting this off-grid autarky building that produces and manages its own resources in order to fulfill human needs in a resilient and regenerative way. \u00c4erdsch\u00ebff is striving to be self-sufficient in water (through storage and filtering systems), in electricity (through photovoltaic and solar thermal systems), in heating and cooling the building (passive solar and ventilation systems), and as well as in food production.\r\nThis pioneering project is a large-scale collaborative experimental learning project and will be the first publicly funded earthship in the world. Thus, the \u00c4erdsch\u00ebff will be a hub for social diversity and a showcase for a cultural transition to a low-impact world. We will create a space of sharing that awaken the desire of education in each one of our visitors, regardless of their age, their backgrounds and their place of origin. It is in this spirit that we are putting into practice notions of solidarity, respect, dignity and mobilisation. The mission of \u00c4erdsch\u00ebff is to create relationships between people and create community.", "http://www.wildfutures.org/", null, "erasmus_2017-3-LU01-KA105-037221_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL13"}
