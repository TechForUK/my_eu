The EU-funded http://www.truck-safe.eu (TRUCK-SAFE) (Development of an automated system for safely securing cargo on haulage trucks using high tensile multi-layer fabric) project is taking on the challenge. It is aiming to avoid dozens of deaths per year and billions of euros in losses that result from improperly secured land cargo being transported within the EU.\n\nIn this context, the project team is perfecting a revolutionary automatic tensioning device with sensors to secure truck cargo and reduce lashing times by as much as an hour. It is developing more durable and resistant cargo-securing textile, combining it with a fully automated self-ratcheting system that automatically pulls the fabric in place. In addition, the new system boasts on-board alarms that quickly adjust load stress and alert the driver if tension on the cargo or on the securing straps is reduced.\n\nAlready, the TRUCK-SAFE system was integrated into a demonstration trailer at the IAA Commercial Vehicle fair 2014 in Hannover, Germany. It was then nominated for the Trailer Innovation 2015 competition in the Safety category, with plans to demonstrate it during the next IAA in Hannover (autumn 2015). With this in mind, the project team is targeting a 3\u00a0% market penetration rate of the 330\u00a0000 cargo trucks expected to be in circulation.\n\nThe European road freight sector could benefit considerably from the technology, keeping in mind that there are 600\u00a0000 companies in the sector, mostly small and medium-sized enterprises. Beyond increased safety, the benefits from widespread use of this novel technology include reduced health insurance costs in the industry. The long-term effect on land-based trade in Europe is likely to be a positive one indeed.", null, "http://www.joloda.com", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/163329.jpg", "fp7_111569_952095838"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9DH", "Building Learnings Education New Digital", "St Austin's Primary School", 103162.0, "The European approach must enable our students to show tolerance, cooperation and collaboration with each other. One of our main goals will be to make our students acquire the rights and responsibilities so that they feel full citizens of the world they will build. In the course of lifelong learning, students will have to find their place regardless of age, gender, ethnic group, cultural background or social level. In this project, we want to make pupils, teachers, school actors and families aware of the importance of building a generation that wants to create, produce and feel responsible. They will have to make sense of their lives according to their wishes and abilities.\r\nIn order to do this, we must promote diversity and cultural wealth, offer our students the benefits of communication technologies through digital use, better understand foreign language learning, help students in difficulty or in a situation of disability.\r\nWe will discuss our professional practices, taking particular account of the innovative pedagogical actions.\r\nWe will also seek to improve the content and pedagogical evaluation of learning so that all pupils can progress at their own pace according to the proposed tool thanks to a confrontation of ideas between all the teachers involved in this project.\r\nMembership of European citizenship will also be a driving force behind the project. European construction has enabled and will enable our students to actively participate in the work around memory and the transmission of democratic and republican values.\r\n\r\nThe project will cover many areas, so that students will increase their artistic skills, learning, motivation, entrepreneurship, creative thinking, digital skills, active citizenship ...\r\nChildren from all countries will co-operate in common activities, assist each other in activities that will help respect cultural diversity and develop empathy.\r\n\r\nChildren will have many advantages as this project will have a common goal. The intention of the project is to share and celebrate best practices in all partner schools. All participants will appreciate cultural differences and will see that each country has different approaches to teaching and learning. The project also aims to promote tolerance and respect for other cultures.", "http://www.st-austins.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA219-037364_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L19"}
