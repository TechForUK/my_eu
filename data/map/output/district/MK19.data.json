More European countries are emphasising the importance of making visible and valuing learning that takes place outside formal education and training institutions, for example at work, in leisure time activities and at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, despite a number of initiatives and recommendations on the recognition of informal learning (c.f. European guidelines for validating non\u2011formal and informal learning, CEDEFOP) there is a wide gap between the recognition of formal and informal or non-formal learning. Access to the recognition of informal learning is patchy and the outcome of recognition process is  too often treated with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mozilla Open Badges, an initiative launched by the Mozilla Foundation in September 2011, provides a response to the needs for the recognition (formal and informal) of learning (formal and informal).  Open Badges are portable and verifiable, allowing learners to showcase work, document skill sets and competencies, and create a robust portrait of their abilities wherever they were acquired: whether in school, in the community, on the job or online. Millions of badges have already been delivered and the initiative has received the support from leading organisations in the field of education, business, policy and citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aims and objectives of Badge Europe, BEU (pronounced \u201cBe You\u201d) are to exploit the benefits of Open Badges to:\r\n\r\n- To create the conditions for a Europe-wide and world-wide recognition of learning achievements;\r\n\r\n- To open and facilitate the systematic access to the recognition of non-formal and informal learning;\r\n\r\n- To place formal and informal recognition of learning on a par; \r\n\r\n- To create new employment and learning opportunities for all; and\r\n\r\n- To bring a European contribution to the leadership of the world-wide Open Badge movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nBEU will be developing a network of organisations and practitioners to: \r\n\r\n- Promote the use of Open Badges for the recognition of learning;\r\n\r\n- Develop Open Badge initiatives at institutional/local/city/regional/national levels (e.g. Cities of Learning, developing the example of Chicago Summer of Learning - http://explorechi.org);\r\n\r\n- Promote Open Badges at policy levels;\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative practices in learning and employment; and\r\n\r\n- Make recommendations and implement improvements to the Open Badge Infrastructure, technologies and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose activities will be carried out directly, with the support of Open Workshops (6) and of a MOOC. (Massive Open Online Course )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTCOMES\r\n\r\nThe main outcomes of the project are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Developing a trustworthy infrastructure to increase job market fluidity and a seamless environment for the recognition of individual skills to full qualifications;\r\n\r\n- A European Open Badge Network led by a steering committee composed of associate partners to contribute to the outcomes of the project and prepare its self-sustainability;\r\n\r\n- A dynamic Inventory of Open Badge Initiatives and resources;\r\n\r\n- A series of guidelines, green, white and discussion papers on Open Badges for Individuals, Open Badges for Organisations, Open Badges in Territories, Open Badges and Quality management and Open Badges and Policies;\r\n\r\n- Guidelines for bridging ECTS/ECVET/Europass documents with Open Badges;\r\n\r\n- Recommendations for the improvement of Open Badge Infrastructure, technologies and services;\r\n\r\n- A Research Report on Open Badge Implementations;\r\n\r\n- A Community Portal, bimonthly Newsletter and regular webcasts; and\r\n\r\n- A series of Open Workshops and a MOOC;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED IMPACT\r\n\r\n- Empower individuals to make their competencies and talents visible;\r\n\r\n- Empower teachers with the means to challenge traditional assessment models;\r\n\r\n- Provide early school leavers with the possibility to have their competencies recognised and further developed in a setting more appropriate to their goals, styles and desires (self-study, home schooling, school of second chance, apprenticeship, etc.);\r\n\r\n- Recognise the competencies acquired at work into a currency that is valuable on the job market;\r\n\r\n- Increase transparency and establish trusted communication between employers, jobseekers and education providers;\r\n\r\n- Increase the confidence of adults to participate in lifelong learning by providing a simple and straightforward mechanism to have one\u2019s current competencies recognised, as a foundation for further learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS\r\n\r\nThe long term benefits are a more inclusive learning provision, a more open employment market and an increased trust in the data relative to individual achievements (CVs, diploma transcripts, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nBeuth-Hochschule fuer Technik Berlin (Germany) Coordinator\r\n\r\nCambridge Professional Development (UK)\r\n\r\nADPIOS (France)\r\n\r\nEDEN (UK/Europe)\r\n\r\nDiscendum Oy (Finland)\r\n\r\nDienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (The Netherlands)\r\n\r\nRadom Institute (Poland)\r\n\r\nDigitalme (UK)\r\n\r\nARTES (Italy)", "http://www.eden-online.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE01-KA200-000675_1"], ["7ES", "eLene4work: Learning to learn for new digital soft skills for employability", "EUROPEAN DISTANCE AND E-LEARNING NETWORK LBG", 331579.0, "Many reports issued by the European Union, by University researchers and human resources experts point out that the so called \u201csoft\u201d skills are closely connected with employability of young people entering the labour market.

The discussion is re-opened in the new context - digital and online open learning (OOL) - changing the landscape of education since the past years. Digital transformation of education and training systems, digital skills and online learning faces many challenges. Education institutions and employers are often reluctant to recognise OOL and question its validation, credentialization and proctoring.ReOPEN project directly addresses the recommendations published in the study of the European Commission \"Validation of Non-formal MOOC-based Learning\" (2016) implemented in 2014-2015 (http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC96968/lfna27660enn.pdf), specifically by the project aim - to create instruments to develop validated OOL for recognition of prior and non-formal learning. ReOPEN project raises the following objectives that directly meet EC recommendations:1. To design a platform for non-formal open learning curriculum development with learning validation and recognition instruments in place (learner credentials, digital badges, learning path recognition and assessment tools).2. To train teachers and trainers (T&T) at C-VET organizations, companies, higher education (HE) institutions and adult learning organizations to design validated non-formal open learning curriculum,  to apply of digital badges as a new form of digital credentialisation and tracking one\u2019s learning path in non-formal open learning and to recognize non-formal open learning results in formal curricular. 3.

EU-ordered foresight studies on the issues raised by learning modernization in higher education in the 21st century clearly shows that the major bottleneck found is the staff competence and preparedness, more specifically at the institutional leadership and executive management level.\r\n\r\nD-TRANSFORM, which gathers together specialists of e-Education from various institutions (University, higher education ministries, consultancy in learning innovation, e-Education networks) primarily considers that digital technologies, like Massive Open Online Courses, (MOOCs) and Open Educational Resources are an essential lever for transforming the higher education systems and adapting them to the new needs of youth and requirements of work-market (lifelong training). D-TRANSFORM intends to produce recommendations on various aspects of a university strategy based on the use of digital tools. The following questions will be addressed: (i) the role of MOOCs in enhancing competitiveness, international attractiveness and in strengthening the identity of universities; but (ii) also the possible disruptions that they may cause in the educational process and the educational body, and the solutions to be applied; (iii) the benefits in resource sharing capacity versus the need for \u201ccontextualization\u201d (by providing a \u201cprivate space\u201d within the MOOC \u201cpublic space\u201d); (iv) the necessary balance between online and face-to-face learning; and finally (v) the economic aspects (business models, cost-effectiveness, public and private funding opportunities).\r\n\r\nBased on these recommendations, D-TRANSFORM will set up two \u201cleadership schools\u201d, dedicated, for the 1st time in Europe, to the university governances.

The recognition and transfer of individual credits through ECTS was created for an era of physical mobility, and is optimised accordingly. \r\n\r\nWhile these tools can be used to support open education and virtual mobility, a number of caveats exist to their use, including that:\r\n- little to no guidance exists on how to document virtual mobility / open education experiences for the purposes of credit transfer.\r\n- procedures for recognition of prior learning or of non-formal/informal learning do not scale to the massive numbers of students enrolling in open education programmes such as MOOCs\r\n- there is no European approach to recognising, transferring or scaling open education modules.\r\n\r\nThese problems are so pronounced, that many open educational providers are creating parallel systems of credentials that are not even described in terms of ECTS - leading to a situation where millions of students per year are enrolling in open courses offered by universities which do not necessarily award valid or recognised forms of credit.\r\n\r\nThis project intends to address these issues by creating a standard format for describing open education and virtual mobility experiences in terms of ECTS which:\r\n\u2022 Addresses common criticisms (lack of trust) of open education, in particular with respect to student assessment and identity\r\n\u2022 Is scalable to hundreds or thousands of students through automatic issuing and verification of certificates\r\n\u2022 Can capture a wide range of non-formal and formal open education experiences\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project is divided into five stages involving:\r\nStage 1: Definition of Quality Credentials\r\nWe will propose a quality system that evaluates the quality credential based on their transparency, ease-of-recognition and ease-of-portability \u2013 this quality system will then be used to evaluate current credential-types on offer, and to inform credential-improvement activities in the next stages.\r\n\r\nStage 2: Enhance Transparency of Quality Credentials by creating a Learning Passport\r\nThe consortium will propose a transparency instrument, building on proposals in the field, which documents the (a) course design, (b) learning activities undertaken by the learner, and (c) assessment activities, which make up a credential. This \u2018learning passport\u2019 is intended to serve as a supplement to the credential, to facilitate its recognition by under institutions. To this end, we will pilot its usage by using it to transfer information on credentials in 6 Higher Education Institutions, thus ensuring that it fulfils its purpose.\r\nStage 3: Propose Technological Methods to Strengthen Automatic Exchange of Recognition Information\r\nShould the process of recognition of credentials be conducted entirely manually, it would be extremely time consuming and inefficient, especially were such processes to be conducted at scale. To this end, we will use roadmapping to propose a meta-data standard, ontology and a set of interlocking technologies which would allow for automatic exchange of credentials between Higher Education Institutions\r\n\r\nStage 4: Clarify Concepts around Open Educational Recognition\r\nThe proper use of recognition tools described in Stage 2 and Stage 3 depend on the successful application and understanding of concepts such as estimation of workload, verification of student identity, fair and accurate assessment, and quality assurance of learning. Since there are differences of varying degree in applying these concepts in open education and in traditional formal education, we will propose guidelines for the correct interpretation of each of these concepts. The methodology applied here will involve collaborative authoring by the partners, backed up by the same process of peer-review used under Stage 1.\r\n\r\nStage 5: Study and Predict the Impacts of Open Education Recognition\r\nWe will build exploratory scenarios, which describe events and trends as they could evolve based on alternative assumptions on how open education recognition might influence the future. Thus, the technique will be used to develop a future history\u2014that is, the evolution from present conditions to one of several futures. The scenarios will outline a causal chain of decisions and circumstances that lead from the present, displaying the conditions of important variables over time. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that by increasing the quantity and quality of recognition processes in OE we will:\r\n\u2022 Create new flexible learning pathways for students inside Higher Education\r\n\u2022 Allow institutions to increase the scope of their offer, by integrating teaching/learning done at other institutions into their curricula\r\n\u2022 Improve resource-efficiency within HEIs\r\n\u2022 Lead to an increase in the use and impact of Open Educational Practices", "http://www.eden-online.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE01-KA203-003546_6"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7ES", "EUROPEAN DISTANCE AND E-LEARNING NETWORK LBG*", 52954.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_30750", 2017], ["7ES", "EUROPEAN DISTANCE AND E-LEARNING NETWORK LBG*", 49711.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_55906", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK19"}
