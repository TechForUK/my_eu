This is based on established European members and the change that having new member states brings, as well as what effects it has had on all countries involved in the exchange, specifically young people.\r\n\r\nThis exchange arose as a result of successfully conducted trilateral youth exchange by the tree partners in summer 2015 in Finland and contacts formed during attendance at International training early in 2014 by all partners in the exchange.  During and after the trilateral exchange in Finland, communication has been maintained and resulted in this proposal. An advanced planning visit will be arranged in June 2017 in Copenhagen, Denmark where all parties will discuss and take the plans forward.  It is intended that the format of the exchange will be finalized then.  Open dialogue about the programme has been an ongoing process.  All partners in the exchange are members of African European Youth Network and have had other means of co-operations in the past specially, in the field of Culture and Media. All partners involved, both youngsters and leaders will be actively participating in all aspects of the exchange program.\r\n\r\nThe objective is exploring the impact and raising awareness of an expanding European Union relating to young people\u2019s issues about Minorities and Mainstream Europeans. We will focus primarily on how citizenship affects young people on a daily basis and how it affects their participation in the long term and explore local, national and European differences for all countries.\r\n\r\nThe countries involved are Denmark, Poland, Finland, Sweden, UK, Portugal, Norway and Ireland.\r\n\r\nVenue: Copenhagen, Denmark\r\n\r\nDuration of the project: 10 days (14-23.07.2017), including the travel days.\r\n\r\nThere will be 40 participants in the exchange including youth leaders.\r\n\r\nDuring the exchange, participants will be introduced to the concept of informal group workshops and to support the development of their communication and presentation skills. They will be introduced gradually to games and exercises designed to stimulate discussion about national identity, European citizenship and integration and they will be given increased responsibility for peer leading within workshop sessions. Youth workers will support the group to draw out and analyze points that they raise naturally through their group discussions.\r\n\r\nDuring the planned discussion workshops in the Youth Exchange, participants will discuss their knowledge and perception about their counterpart and also compare and contrast their ideas about Europe as a multicultural continent. These sessions will develop their understanding of National and European identity and challenge their ideas about society and culture. They will learn tolerance and respect for other cultures and identify ways of overcoming barriers to living together. \r\n\r\nThis Youth Exchange will prepare participants to take part in a project of this nature. The exchange will be recorded visually and be made in DVDs for exploitation and sharing experience with other European partners and stack-holders after the conclusion of the exchange. The result will be shown in every possible EU youth in action future events that the two organizations participate in. The DVD will also be distributed to local youth centers, libraries and other relevant groups. \r\n\r\nIntended Outcomes\r\n\u2022 The minority young people will develop an awareness of different cultures and that they are European citizens.\r\n\u2022 The participants will share a common understanding of youth issues through collaborative working.\r\n\u2022 The participants will learn new skills including: employability skills, social media skills, different languages\r\nThe project will help to raise the self-esteem of participants by illustrating that their contributions are valued not only at home but also in a European Arena.\r\n\r\nThe project will support young people\u2019s personal development, enabling them to understand: national identity; the geography of Europe and the rest of the world; cultures, values and traditions typical of European countries; cultures, values and traditions typical of cultures outside of Europe; barriers to working together and ways to overcome barriers; racism, xenophobia and discrimination of minority groups; and issues related to successful immigration.

The new generation of high tech digital tools and cutting edge machinery, like 3D printers, is transforming and leading the applied arts and craft sectors to a new digital age. To lead this transformation Europe needs to count with skilled handicraft teachers and trainers, equipped with the necessary competencies and resources to integrate these digital tools into innovative ICT based teaching and learning practices.\r\n\r\nVET teachers and trainers in craft sectors are usually handicraft professionals with expertise in their respective areas, and teaching in VET craft courses is frequently a secondary occupation. In many EU countries, initial teaching education is not compulsory for these VET teachers and trainers or some minimum training is required. They tend to acquire their teaching competencies through their teaching practice or through some continuous VET courses on train the trainers, usually not adapted to the specific needs of teaching crafts. The situation with regard to the training on ICT-based teaching skills is even worst, due to this lack of training opportunities and because many traditional Crafts do not use ICT and, as a result, neither handicraft teachers and trainers use ICT for teaching VET. The consequence is a lack of innovative ICT-based teaching practices in traditional handicraft VET, losing all the potential benefits of using ICT in education.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to support the professional development of handicraft teachers and trainers in Europe in their transition to the digital age by improving their teaching competencies on innovative VET education through ICT based methods and tools. The project will prepare handicraft teachers and trainers to adapt also their teaching practice to the next generation of high tech digital tools and cutting edge machinery, like 3D printers, vinyl cutters or laser cutting and engraving.\r\n\r\nTo this purpose, an alliance of Craft sectors organizations and VET experts and providers from 7 countries (Greece, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and United Kingdom) will work together to lead the project and co-create and test the following innovative methods and freely accessible OER:\r\n\r\n- A European ECVET Curriculum (IO1) on ICT skills for teaching Crafts. \r\n- Training Modules (IO2) on ICT based teaching methods specifically adapted for Crafts.\r\n- An innovative Mobile Instructional Learning APPs (IO3) designed to train handicraft trainers and teacher to use and design their own Mobile Learning APPs (IO5) for teaching Crafts.\r\n- A Multilingual e-learning platform (IO4), with innovative e-Learning courses and OER on ICT-based teaching methods for Crafts.\r\n- A Guide for validation, certification & accreditation (IO6) of innovative teaching learning methods through ICT in VET for craft sectors in Europe. \r\n\r\nHandicraft teachers and trainers are the main target users of the project products and final beneficiaries are craftsman students, learners and apprentices. During the life time of CRAFTS 3.0 project, the partnership will directly involve 99  handicraft teachers and trainers (32 partners staff / 42 experts involved / 25 target users in pilots), 125 I-VET and C-VET craftsman students, learners and apprentices (in pilots) and 500  stakeholders. A wider audience, of a minimum of 1000 recipients, will be reached at local, regional, national and European level through the planned dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nThe project will apply European frameworks and instruments, like EQF, ECVET, EQAVET, Europass and EPALE, to promote and boost transparency and recognition of competences and qualifications, transnational mobility and the transferability of the project outputs to other Craft and VET organizations at local, regional, national and European level, with the support and active cooperation of a network of key associated partners and relevant stakeholders involved in the project.   \r\n\r\nCRAFTS 3.0 shall support the professional development of handicraft teachers and trainers in order to improve their teaching competencies in innovative education through ICT. The project will have a direct impact in the improvement of the ICT skills of handicraft teachers and trainers.

More than 50 different models have been developed within LLP-program, focusing on different aspect of Quality management in VET. Despite all the effort, the experiences show that it is difficult for VET-organization structuring evaluation into new improvement initiatives. The available QA guides and kits are based on a fairly traditional model which focuses on \u201cevaluation\u201d rather than engaging the teaching staff on incorporation of evaluative ideas into practice. The experiences of the partnership, CEDEFOP and available research shows that the perceptions of the leadership and teaching staff concerning quality initiatives is one of the main barriers.  They have different answers to questions such as need for QA, suitable QA-model, implementation, evaluation and review. (CEDEFOP Leadership in VET, \u201cThe factors that matter for Quality Assurance in VET by Adrie Visscher & Maria Hendriks and LdV-project REVIMP - From Review to Improvement in European Vocational Education and Training)Overall objective The overall objective of the project \u201cPromoting quality culture in VET \u201c is to support VET leadership to motivate and engage VET-teaching staff in implementation of quality initiatives at VET-institution by improving prior elaborated guidelines. AimThe aim of the project is to further develop the elaborated guidelines for VET leadership for facilitating participatory approach to ensure involvement of teachers. The guidelines will cover following aspects according to EQAVET quality cycle; how to: a) create awareness of quality assurance ideology and benefitsb) engage staff in selection of Quality assurance modelc) plan the evaluation process of QA finding with the teaching staffd) review and plan for improvement of the VET-activitiese) promotion of a shared vision on VET-educationThe above guideline will be complemented by best practises from participating countries and from the 39 best practise projects from QALL network, complemented by checklists.

The guidelines will be developed on the bases of EQAVET quality cycle in an interactive form and also in printed and electronic form in languages. It will be supplemented by best practises, practical advice and examplesThe impact The impact of the project will be a) empowerment of teaching staff with regards to quality initiatives in VET-organisation b) enabling VET-organisation in overcoming the present barriers in utilization of evaluation result of QA-initiatives in review and improvement c) facilitating the work of EQAVET in monitoring the impacts of their quality models and indicators in VET-organisation at EU-level.", "http://www.rinova.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-SE01-KA202-022124_2"], [2016, "Refugees Empowerment through VET in an incLUsive Europe", "RINOVA LIMITED", 267794.0, 5, 8, "The goal of project REVaLUE is to enhance the labor inclusion of refugees, subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers by improving their access to skilled jobs. The corrective action of REVaLUE will strive to tackle all major causes that prevent refugees\u2019 labour integration, namely:- lack of recognition of knowledge, competence and skills, including previous studies;- deskilling;- lack of working experience in the host country;- language.Through a solid partnership, made of a combination of VET providers and migrant associations based in Italy, France, Germany, UK and Hungary, the project will:1. facilitate the recognition of formal, non-formal and informal knowledge, competences and skills of refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through the design and implementation of a toolkit for migrants' skills assessment; 2. transfer new highly qualifying skills to refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers through tailored VET courses, one for \u201cMigrant Service Providers\u201d and another for \u201cSocial Enterprise Manager\u201d, that meet their specific learning needs and characteristics, in particular the language; 3. provide refugees/subsidiary protection holders/asylum seekers with hands-on experience through the creation and implementation of work-based laboratories.The target group of project REVaLUE will be refugees/subsidiary protection holders and asylum seekers recently arrived to Europe. Female migrants will be given special consideration, integrating a gender approach in the design and implementation of project\u2019s products. Although the beneficiaries of the action are constituted by humanitarian migrants only, the project\u2019s products will be applicable to other kinds of migrants as well.The innovative feature of REVaLUE lies in the creation of 2 VET courses that put together the best characteristics of VET teaching methodologies (use of audio-visual teaching material, work-based training) with the needs and requirements of adult education (acquisition and strengthening of basic skills) all bound together with an effective language methodology (CLIL \u2013 Content and Language Integrated Learning). This innovative combination will make an exceptionally complete learning experience for the beneficiaries and will constitute an important example for future training development. The courses, moreover, will provide training for accessing well remunerated, medium/high-skills jobs in two sectors that are generally receptive to the participation of non-native workers, creating real opportunities for the beneficiaries to escape the low socio-economic cycle in which they often find themselves. A second innovative aspect of project REVaLUE is that it creates a skills assessment tool designed to assess both informal and non-formal learning and the level of education attained in the home country. Informal and non-formal learning have to be properly assessed to determine the whole spectrum of competences and skills and to direct the person who is being assessed towards the most appropriate educational and professional pathways. However, especially in the case of humanitarian migrants, including innovative ways to assess formal learning is equally important, given that they usually lack certificates and proof of their previous studies. The tool will be designed to make it easier for refugees to describe their educational experience, and for service providers and job counsellors to assess their effective level of education.Finally, project REVaLUE will not limit itself to the creation of a skills assessment tool, but it will build on that experience to create two other products:- a CV certified by the project for all beneficiaries of the skills assessment process. To this end the REVaLUE CV will bear in the cover page a description of the project and the assessment process that led to the drafting of the CV. - The report \u201cWho migrates to Europe?

Eight partners from across six programme countries will adapt and develop the Net-Working for Quality Assurance model (developed in a previous Leonardo da Vinci TOI project - LLP/LdV/TOI/2012/IRL-502) so as to ensure its relevance across a wider VET journey (defined as including some/all of the following stages: decision to access VET, through employment services, through a guidance process, initial referral into VET, VET provision, transition to employment/ higher education, up-skilling in the workplace). \r\n\r\nContext/needs addressed: The previous NQA project identified that quality tends to exist within services/provision but can be significantly reduced during transition points in a clients VET journey. The Interagency approach aims to strengthen the links between stakeholders particularly in relation to shared goals and trust, and develop a culture of quality which will be aspired to by a range of stakeholders representing various stages of the VET journey. \r\nPreviously, NQA sought to influence the long term achievement of Bruges (2010) which advocates the progression of individual citizens through the creation and delivery of quality assured VET initiatives 'Given the role of VET in European Societies and economies, it is crucial to ensure the sustainability and excellence of vocational education and training' (Bruges Communique, 2010). However, NQA found that quality VET journeys involve many stakeholders and many stages and that the quality of this journey particularly for those most disadvantaged required a continuum of quality assurance underpinned or enabled by quality cultures. Quality assurance within VET provision is not sufficient, but requires the VET sector to cooperate with a range stakeholders from employment services, to employers and that 'a transparency and a common approach to quality assurance in VET' (Bruges, 2010) should be a longer term objective. NQCA seeks to do just this. \r\n\r\nNQCA will research VET journeys, identify VET case studies, research QA/quality culture/Interagency working and develop an NQCA model. It will further develop NQA as a quality label, design and test Master training and NQCA training, implement 91 interagency meetings , 6 transnational meetings and 7multiplier events. It will take a serious approach to Policy-Practice gaps, create a space for this dialogue and design a Toolkit for Policy Makers to support sustainability and recognition. NQCA will demonstrate the value created through use of a Social Impact Evaluation and disseminate widely the learning achieved. The partners will utilise a Implementation science methodology (IO3).\r\n\r\nTarget Groups: Learners (particulraly those disadvantaged in Education/Labour market), stakeholders involved in the VET journey (including employers), National stakeholders with a Quality agenda, European wide QA. \r\n\r\nCore partnership: 8 organisations representing 6 countries (Ireland, UK (Northern Irealnd and England), Finland, Germany, Hungary and Italy) and includes community based employment support services, learning/skills/entrepreneurial consortium, a Chamber of commerce, a large VET school, a national VET organisation, an EU wide social inclusion/labour market/and policy focused consortium, a large city based employment support service focused on employment & labour market policy, education policy and lifelong learning.\r\n\r\nMain results: NQCA model, NQA quality label, Implemented and tested pilot of interagency working (7 locations), Toolkit for Policy makers, Master training & NQCA training, Social Impact Evaluation.\r\n\r\nImpact: \r\n-Learner impact: quality will underpin their entire VET journey, placing the learner at the centre of VET provision. \r\n-Particiapting organisations:  development of interagency working and quality culture, enabling bottom up approaches to QA, creating geographical areas recognised by the NQA quality label\r\n-National organisations: improve channels of communications between the bottom up approach & the top down policy approach, to lessen the gap between policy and practice, and enable quality culture to exist within the full quality cycle. \r\n-The NQA evaluation identified that many partners/stakeholders were not aware of the need for a forum to discuss quality assurance and VET. NQCA aims to have this type of wide scale impact though the creation of such fora and interagency networks in order to support organisations to work on/understand quality in VET. \r\nNQCA seeks to have long term enduring impact on partners & stakeholders as it will affect values, beliefs and behaviours and is a model which is transferable to many situations, contexts and other sectors.
