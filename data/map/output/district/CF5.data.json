The reasons for this include the costs and expertise required to run the LCA studies. However, the project aims to tackle these issues and devise methods and tools for sectors such as bio-based plastics, industrial machinery, electronics, renewable energy, sensors and smart textiles. These sectors were chosen since manufacturers showed a keen interest in demonstrating to SMEs how they can reduce their environmental impact.\n\nWith access to free web tools, SMEs will be able to see how their needs can be met and make full use of the technology available to them. These include key environmental performance indicators (KEPIs) for smart textiles and a product carbon footprint (PCF) based on technology parameters of printed circuit boards. Building on the findings from the survey, customised approaches by sector are under way. For example, in smart textiles, developers, designers and business executives of SMEs can take advantage of a two-step approach based on ready-made LCA data and a fast-track LCA approach. This will allow the calculation of the environmental performance of materials, at the energy and life-cycle stages.\n\nThese approaches are regarded as the perfect entry point for SMEs to LCA strategies, so devising a compatible tool for SMEs will be a key element.

The rapidly increasing aged population in EU also places a huge burden on governments and health care systems that are not adequately equipped to meet their needs.\n\nWHYWEAGE is an initiative established to identify areas of research for better understanding of molecular mechanisms of ageing and for finding solutions to improve quality of life. Twelve successful workshops were held with participants from 21 European countries, including industrial stakeholders along with scientists to provide technical and commercial perspective. Topics such as 'biomarkers of ageing', 'oxidative stress, protein damage and protein maintenance', vascular ageing, 'sarcopenia, muscle weakness and physical exercises', and 'clinical biogerontological studies' were addressed.\n\nDeficits in knowledge and technology were identified and research areas were prioritised based on criticality of intervention.

Also 22% of our pupils are FSM and we receive a deprivation grant and EMAS support for traveller families. Our initial reason for Global work was based upon 'Aspiration' as we want our pupils to become global citizens of the world. Over the last 5 years we have developed an international ethos, which has enabled us to gain re-accreditation of the ISA. We have also developed good working relationships with partner schools from across Europe and would like to continue to foster closer ties for pupil and staff CPD.  Our overriding objectives are  to continue to provide all our pupils with a greater understanding of Global Citizenship, develop I.C.T. skills linked to coding and for our pupils to have a greater knowledge of sustainable energy within their own environments.ObjectivesAs a consequence our staff need to have a deeper understanding of coding (an I.C.T. skill that will become compulsory in Wales in September 2016). The Danish school have used coding technology for some time, therefore it will afford staff opportunities to share ideas and experiences, creating links which will benefit our learners.Number of participantsThe two teachers travelling to Denmark, the Danish staff will develop their own CPD through training teachers across Europe. Our staff will be able to impart knowledge to pupils and cascade information via formal INSET'S to own staff and on a wider basis through our cluster, family of schools and our Global Learning Network.ActivitiesStaff would initially be given a tour of the school to see how it operates and understand management structures: meet with all staff to discuss all aspects of school life, staff training and enrichment opportunities, to enhance pupils IT and employability skills.  We would also use time to meet with our dedicated Lego representative to discuss our potential Erasmus + project. Staff would acquire specific coding knowledge by being trained by other teachers in the partner school, and observing pupils putting these skills into action.  We would also be talking and listening to learners and will also carry out the project via e-twinning links. MethodologyWhen back home skills will be implemented and similar to a co-coaching model will afford other teachers the opportunities to acquire these skills.Description of ResultsThe two members of staff will become lead practitioners in the school and within our Local Education Authority. Our pupil baseline of understanding of coding is zero, therefore this project will equip our pupils to have the knowledge to access and use new ICT technologies to enhance their learning experiences.Impact EnvisagedPupil and staff ICT skills will be enhanced. The trained staff will make a difference through their new knowledge gained through Job Shadowing and be able to disseminate effectively across the school. These staff will work with senior management in order to raise the profile of Coding. This will then impact on Teaching and Learning in IT, with a view to raising the ambition and achievement of all pupils. Long Term BenefitsThe children and staff will acquire life long learning skills in ICT, which they can apply to constantly evolving world technology.

With this fear and prejudice having already resulted in violent repercussions in various countries, we see a need to work to equip young people and youth workers with the kinds of values and attitudes we believe are pertinent to construct a new and improved multicultural Europe, as well as key skills and competences, as well as concrete exercises the participants can utilise in their local realities to contribute to more knowledgeable, understanding and equitable local communities, in facing this new Europe.The project will bring together a total of 26 people for 5 working days in Lisbon, Portugal. The participants are youth workers, trainers, educators, or volunteers involved in youth work coming from the countries of the 11 partner organisations.

Share among youth workers and partners common concerns about issues of conflict, conflict management, migration and prejudice, exchange good practices and tools;6. Enhance international cooperation, including trust between participants and organisations;7. Promote heightened recognition of the educational value of NFE activities for building a more aware and understanding Europe.The training course treats conflict management as its main point. Significantly, we are basing the project around the concrete exercise \u201cMission Z\u201d, which is an educational, interactive board game that provides the participants with an experience featuring a number of elements and layers that are part of a conflict situation. The game is described in more detail on http://www.bb-games.eu/games/mission-z/ We also use other methods of experiential simulation exercises during this project, as we seek to develop empathy and creative conflict management as the main skills and competences for the participants.

Participants will be able to understand the differences of various eating habits and to consciously choose which one is the best for them. As most of the organisations have different experience, we are sure that participants will be able to gain very important knowledge about foods and will be motivated to interest even at home about this kind of topic.3. Youngsters will understand what is the consumerism culture and how it damages our world and will be able to make conscious decisions towards buying. Though the results of it almost never seen in the home country, the world is one big family therefore we really need to start to care about others. I.e. cheap clothing has a real cost and it is not fair that anybody sit 12 hours sewing and sewing until they collapse of dehydration and hunger.

Activity 1 - Training for youth workers on participatory methods for monitoring and evaluation for impact assessment of learning activities: this activity (5 days mobility in Romania, May 2017; 27 youth workers from 9 organizations, 3 youth workers/ organization. They will be youth workers with various roles and sometimes overlapping roles in their NGO that are using or should use M&E tools in their daily work. \r\n2. Piloting of minimum 9 methods back home in the period of 3 months prior to the transnational seminar (at least one of the methods acquired during the training in one of their learning activities / NGO).\r\n3. Activity 2 - Transnational seminar for identifying and exploiting of enabling and capacity-building factors as instruments for future participatory monitoring and evaluation for impact assessment (5 days mobility in Bulgaria, August 2017, 27 representatives from 9 partner organizations, 3 participants/ country). They will be the same 3 youth workers that came to the TC.\r\n4. Elaboration of a short handbook on participatory methods for monitoring and evaluation for impact assessment.\r\n\r\nDuring the activities different non-formal and informal methods will be used to support the exchange of know-how between participants. Methodology used will include participatory techniques for M&E, through simulations and role play, such as: Semi-structured Interviewing, Focus Group, Participatory Mapping, Diaries; Storytelling, Most Significant Change Method, PhotoVoice, Participatory Video.\r\n\r\nFor impact and long term benefits we expect for the participants and the organizations:\r\n- capacity to compare project/ activity objectives and actual achievement;\r\n- capacity to assess whether methods used and objectives are and remain relevant over time in working with youth, capacity to plan for best action strategies;\r\n- extended partnership network with organizations having the same interest and area of work;\r\n- easy and effective transferability of achievements and lessons learned between youth workers;\r\n- ability to choose, adapt and use creative and participatory M&E methods to gain timely and effective information to use for improving learning activities planning and implementation;\r\n- capacity for self-evaluation and usage of European evaluation instruments such as the YouthPass and EuroPass and creative methods to disseminate learning impact to stakeholders;\r\n- intercultural communication competences such as dialogue, tolerance, diversity management.\r\n- develop project proposals in partnerships in order to further explore and promote participatory monitoring and evaluation usage beyond impact assessment only in youth work;\r\n- the partner organizations will also strengthen their accountability to donors and community members.", null, null, "erasmus_2016-3-RO01-KA105-035439_5"], ["5EQ", "Active Citizenship & Volunteering Training Course for Youth Workers", "youth pioneers", 17869.0, "\u201cActive Citizenship & Volunteering Training Course for Youth Workers\u201d is a training course on 11-18 March 2017 in Antalya, Turkey for youth workers from programme countries under Erasmus+ Key Action 1 (KA1): Learning Mobility of Individuals, Mobility of Youth Workers.

The key challenges are that they do not always have the option to take part in organisations of youth without disabilities,  because of accessibility and/or psychological barriers, and are generally organised in disability networks and disability-specific organisations, which makes participation in decision-making processes more difficult, have difficulties in the access to education and face cumulative discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe and our partners believe that disability issues should be cross-cutting especially in youth policy and believe that this training course will provide further insight on disability issues, foment research on non-formal tools and methods to integrate youth with disabilities and to commit youth workers to include youth with disabilities in the life of their organisation. We aim at including youngsters with disabilities in the actions, projects and life of their NGOs, and empower them to claim their rights in engaging youth work; overcoming clich\u00e9s and prejudices regarding youngsters with disabilities and to show how they can be valuable agents in developing youth work; equipping youth workers with knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will overcome and address positively obstacles and challenges that disability might pose; involving local communities in this process; and to provide a reliable online tool that can be used as a support effective guideline whenever a youngster with disabilities has to be integrated in the life of the organisation organization\r\n\r\nWe will have 33 participants coming from very different countries. All the participants attending this training course will be over 18 years and experienced youth leaders/youth workers that can include youth with disabilities within the structure of their NGOs.

We will focus on accessible adapted legal language, dynamic, and innovative approaches and use the website, specially designed for the training course, as a support tool for all activities. We will set the tone of our training course by going through the historical development of the rights of the persons with disabilities (PWD) and concrete knowledge on the rights of PWD: how human rights courts apply them; what are the key challenges, always to adapted legal language and innovative approaches.This will allow us to show us what is many times behind the clich\u00e9s and discrimination that youth with disabilities face and to equip the participants with knowledge-tool that will benefit inclusion. We will also work on putting ourselves in the shoes of a person with disability resorting to art and innovative dynamics, so that empathy can be worked through a vehicle so linked with emotion as art is, and obtain better results with the participants, contributing to developing their attitudes towards disability.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on best practices and suggestions from a wide range of areas,  we will show participants that more often than not, to be more inclusive towards disability does not necessarily entail many costs or many changes, just requires creativity and commitment, this will be done through optative workshops, ranging from DYI to Sessions of specific funds for projects tackling disabilities. With the knowledge, skills, and attitudes gained with the training course, participants will be required to devise a plan in which they involve their community in helping them being more inclusive regarding disability:  either by donating materials, helping them building adapted material, or simply volunteering (follow-up requirement).We will have prizes to give to the more creative ones to encourage creativity, commitment and thinking outside the box, contributing to engaging their community and empowering youth with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe impact that we expect at all levels is an increasing inclusion of youngsters with disabilities in youth work and to spread that same logics to other areas.

Over the last 10 years we have developed an international ethos, which has enabled us to gain re-accreditation of the ISA. (Plus an agreed action plan for this coming year.)  We have also developed good working relationships with partner schools from across Europe and would like to continue to foster closer ties for pupils and staff CPD.  Our overriding objectives are to continue to provide all our pupils with a greater understanding of Global Citizenship, develop language and I.C.T. skills and for our pupils to have a greater knowledge of different cultural languages. Post BREXIT the ability to speak a modern foreign language will surely make our pupils an asset in the work place.  The benefits to our school's global dimension are immense. Given that we have previously undertaken a KA1 project which dovetailed with our current KA2 project and was very successful I feel justified in linking this application with a future KA2 project.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of a future WAG initiative- the teaching of a modern foreign language- our staff need to have a deeper understanding of delivering a modern foreign languages that will shortly become compulsory in Wales.

As German is used within our feeder Comprehensive school we intend to begin German lessons from Sept 2018. Therefore the opportunity to spend time job shadowing with our German partner will afford staff opportunities to share ideas and experiences of developing methodology, styles and resources that can be used to support and benefit our learners. Although our Finnish partner has IT competencies and is experienced with global projects they are new to us so job shadowing in Finland will focus on the use of ICT in the development of 2nd language skills i.e. developing apps, talking books and audio support. We specifically want to understand how 2nd language teaching is structured initially i.e. ages, methodology, parental involvement, styles, and how these impact on the school and the wider community. \r\n\r\nThe two teachers will job shadow in Germany and two teachers job shadowing in Finland.  Our staff will be able to impart knowledge to pupils and cascade information via formal INSET'S to own staff and cluster. \r\n\r\nStaff would initially be given a tour of the school to see how it operates and understand management structures: meet with all staff to discuss all aspects of school life, staff training and enrichment opportunities, to enhance pupils IT and language skills to support employability skills. Staff would acquire specific methods of teaching a modern foreign  language through the observation of other teaching methods. Using, seeing other resources and observing pupils putting these skills into action.  We would also be talking and listening to learners and will carry out the project via e-twinning links. \r\n\r\nOn return skills will be implemented and similar to a co-coaching model will afford other teachers the opportunities to acquire these skills. \r\n\r\nStaff will become lead practitioners in the school and within our Local Education Authority. At present our pupil baseline of knowledge of modern foreign languages is zero, therefore this project will impact hugely on the staff and the school because it will require a policy for languages and a scheme of work. Pupils will be given the opportunity to learn a modern foreign language that will enhance their cognitive skills which in turn will enhance their own understanding of the English language. Delivery will be by staff who have gained skills and confidence to be able to present a relevant, creative curriculum involving the whole school and wider community.  \r\n\r\nLanguage and ICT skills will be enhanced. The trained staff will make a difference via their new knowledge gained through Job Shadowing and be able to disseminate effectively across the school.

This will then impact on Teaching and Learning in Languages and IT, with a view to raising the ambition and achievement of all pupils. \r\n\r\nThe children and staff will acquire lifelong learning skills using ICT to support language development, which they can apply to a constantly evolving world technology.

The consortium of 7 educational institutions and companies produced teacher education resources (training manual and pedagogical materials), trained teachers of 6 languages in four educational sectors (primary, secondary, higher and vocational), filmed classes of 44 teachers using the IWB, and developed an open educational resource which includes over 250 video clips of IWB-mediated language teaching in 7 countries (http://itilt.eu).  The iTILT project scored 9/10 in EU evaluations covering deliverables and project management.\r\n\r\nWith this background, the new project builds on: a) a well-designed open educational resource whose platform meets stringent technical standards and is immediately available for extension; b) solid research results which derive from classroom contexts closely related to the classes in the new project, and c) an experienced team with complementary skills and a successful 4-year collaboration in hand.  It is our belief that a project which develops and extends our existing work can further support language learners and teachers in making the most of the acquisitional opportunities offered by educational technologies.\r\n\r\nThe new three year project will move beyond the IWB to focus on developing effective teaching and learning of second languages with a much wider range of new and emerging interactive technologies (such as iPads, tablet PCs, learner response systems, and videoconferencing software) both independently and in combination.  The data collection/professional development cycle will include extensive teacher development involving researcher input and peer collaboration using face-to-face and online spaces, followed by two iterations of classroom filming and participant interviews.  The data collected will be integrated into an extended version of the existing iTILT website, and involve new professional development e-resources for pre-service and in-service language teachers and teacher educators.\r\n\r\nThe project team will use the approach developed and refined during the first project based on collaborative action research involving video stimulated reflective dialogue (VSRD) to include teacher and learner perspectives and ensure that the project is grounded in current classroom practice but also reflects the research team\u2019s expertise in effective language teaching with technology. \r\n\r\nThe data collection carried out by the partners covers three sub-programmes:  tertiary education (TK, FR, DE), primary (UK, FR, DE) and secondary (BE, FR) schools.

The FUTE project aims to deliver that in the form of a new DIDACTIC PLATFORM. The platform consists of theory, tools and a training course for teachers and student teachers including training manual. The theoretical framework is Design School Kolding's '6C-model' which incorporates design thinking and methodology. The tools are method cards - physical teaching tools developed via an original approach: user-involving, dialogue-based design methodology. The cards are an adaptation of the 6C-model. Simply put, they are a way to present abstract concepts like the design process and the composition of organizations in easily understood terms and visual models. Finally, the training course provides a solid introduction and instruction in how to incorporate the didactic platform into one's daily teaching. \r\nSeven partners from five countries, which together possess experience in dozens of European projects and capabilities in education, design, development, research and teacher training, will develop, test and implement Method Cards in a variety of school cultures and contexts in Europe. The Method Cards aim to empower teachers to take greater control over their jobs, increase their confidence in and strategic overview of their teaching plan and inject innovation, dynamism and creativity into their classes. The cards will enable and encourage teachers and students to co-create subject content. This will help motivate and interest students and increase job satisfaction for teachers, which will contribute towards retaining talented teachers in their jobs. \r\n\r\nProject activities and our methodological approach is based on design thinking, specifically user-centred design. This approach places the end user and their needs squarely at the centre of proceedings. After an initial needs analysis, completed in close dialogue with 10 pilot teachers, development work begins. Having identified very specifically which areas of teachers' competences that are best served by the Method Cards, the project partners work with the pilot teachers in an iterative loop process of:\r\n\r\nDevelopment -> Teacher Feedback -> Product Fine-Tuning -> Testing -> Evaluation and Triangulation -> loop restarting with Development. So on and so forth until the prototype or final product is ready.\r\n\r\nThis iterative loop is an illustration of the design process. The process is how FUTE will reach a viable teaching tool product that caters to teachers' very specifically identified needs and wishes for the ideal tool to assist them in their day-to-day teaching. There is a strong element of quality assurance and control in this process, which is why it is ideal for development projects. \r\n\r\nDesign School Kolding is keen to bring our expertise in this process to the FUTE project. The school has worked with method compilations as a tool to streamline organizations and workflows for over a decade. Our experience with design minded teacher training has shown us the potential of this method. Working with partner organizations that are expert teacher trainers, we aim to demonstrate the 6C-model's usefulness in the modern teaching environment.\r\n\r\nWe expect FUTE's didactic platform to integrate design methodology in the participating schools, streamline the organizational and planning elements of the teacher's job and increase job satisfaction. The Method Cards should make teaching less stressful and more fun, which is what attracted most teachers to the job in the first place. Students will also be impacted through teachers spending more time teaching and less time administrating, which will increase motivation and  attention.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of introducing design methodology to European classrooms include increased teacher retention in the profession, increased academic performance for students and a decrease in early school leaving.", "http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA201-034271_1"], ["3JR", "Not in Education, Employment, or Training - a challenge for Europe", "Cantonian High School", 380613.0, "The Strategic Framework for Education and Training (ET 2020) for Europe has at its core the important target of reducing the number of young people leaving school early that become Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).
