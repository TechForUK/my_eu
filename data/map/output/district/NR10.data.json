Major results on farmland result from: decline of farmland, mostly due to the pressure of non agricultural uses (urban sprawl, infrastructure...) and increasing land concentration on large, intensive farms, while  small-scale farming is disappearing. In parallel, the forthcoming retirement of a huge majority of farmers, and increasing difficulties to replace them, may mean further rural abandonment. Difficulties are even more important for newcomers (i.e. farmers with no previous agricultural history), which represent a significant part of the new generation entering farming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLand access has so far been largely left out of existing policies and extension services, as most land transfers were deemed to be spontaneously taking place within the family, or on the market. But existing mechanisms are now blocked and there needs to be a specific action to facilitate land access.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho we are\r\n\r\nOur partnership is composed of 9 organisations, from 7 countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the UK). All are operational organisations, directly supporting or training farmers and engaging with citizens and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoals and areas of work: \r\n\r\nThis project will therefore have 3 main strand of work:\r\n\r\n1- Strengthening practical knowledge to secure good land access\r\n\r\n* Identifying, highlighting and networking relevant national organisations \r\n\r\n* Understanding existing options for land tenure (purchase, collective purchase, tenancy, lease-purchase, etc.)\r\n\r\n* Developing specific knowledge and resources about several areas of work, including the \r\n\r\nrole of local authorities in securing farmland or existing solutions for experimenting farming (e.g. incubators).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2- Building citizen support for land access\r\n\r\n* Building up knowledge and skills of volunteers/ local groups/ the public on European land issues and good practices, by developing an \u201ceducational kit\u201d and on-line resources.\r\n\r\n* Engaging with other CSOs and other stakeholders (local authorities, ethical banks, experts).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3- Contributing to the evolution of the support system for farmers' access to land\r\n\r\nWe will draw lessons learnt from some of our thematic and general work  in order to develop policy recommendations and/ or engage with local authorities or other policy-makers on a local/ national or European stage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn output-based and dissemination-oriented project:\r\n\r\nOur project is centered on producing, disseminating and further enriching a series of intellectual outputs (both general and more technical) to a range of audiences. Indeed, while there is a wealth of experiences and questions raised through the practice of our organisations, these are not capitalised, systematised, analysed and shared enough. We therefore see it as essential to develop these intellectual resources and share them with our own constituencies and stakeholders so as to consolidate our own ways of doing, upscale our work, share lessons learnt and improve future practices and policies. Dissemination - based on networking, communication and outreach - is therefore an integral part of our project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected results and longer-term benefits are both tangible and intangible:\r\n\r\nTangible results:\r\n\r\n- a range of resources providing general knowledge to diverse audiences\r\n\r\n- a range of resources providing technical knowledge to diverse audiences: \r\n\r\n- a range of lessons learnt from practices, to be shared with our stakeholders, in particular local authorities and other policy-makers.\r\n\r\n- the development of new tools (e.g. land tenure) and the setting-up of new projects/ initiatives (e.g. incubators) within or supported by our organisations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntangible results and longer-term impacts:\r\n\r\n- Consolidated practical skills, tools and approaches of participating organisations\r\n\r\n- Better-skilled and better-networked organisations supporting farmers/ prospective farmers, with higher access to existing resources on access to land\r\n\r\n- Better access to resources for farmers/ prospective farmers seeking guidance on access to land, and better access to support from a range of organisations and stakeholders\r\n\r\n- Empowered citizens, better able to mobilise and support farmers and other local stakeholders in securing land use for sustainable food production\r\n\r\n- Evolution of public authorities' policies and practices, to better include the need for generational renewal, preservation of local and sustainable agriculture and food production, and participatory approaches to land use and management", null, null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA204-008763_6"], ["4JT", "Move your body and mind - healthy lifestyle for adolescents", "Reepham High School and College", 167911.0, "With this partnership we aim to develop a meaningful and lasting partnership which will develop a mutual understanding of healthy lifestyles and the holistic ingredients to make a healthy adolescent. Our main objective is to help young people identify the harmful habits they possess and direct them to leading healthy lifestyle through healthy nutritional diets, mental health guaranteed by substance misuse prevention, combat or sedentary lifestyle and involvement of physical activity in every day life. The project will study and prove the positive effect of healthy lifestyle and its three aspects on adolescents' academic achievement. It will develop an increased awareness of equal opportunities of students in any condition (both healthy and disabled) and social cohesion thus breaking down barriers, misconceptions and prejudices. The participation of schools with SEN, and disabled students will be a benefit for all of them as the students will learn from and about each other and will feel equal and involved. We will encourage mobility within our organisations ensuring that this mobility is organised in such a way as to maximise the benefit for both students and teachers. The students to form the project teams will be involved on voluntary principle with no restriction of gender, background or age. In the course of their work they will gain points in accordance with their active participation and qualitative performance. Their final scores will be used as a mobility selection criterion. That will provide clear rules and transparency. The students will take part in all the stages of the project - activities, evaluation, dissemination. This will provide them with useful practical experience and will improve their social and ICT skills.The students will act as trainers and teachers to young students from kindergartens and primary schools and disabled children attending day care centres. The partnership will popularise national sports and games and present traditional dances as a means for cultural exchange and physical activity. Each of the schools will deliver lessons in relevant subjects - Biology, Chemistry, Home Economics, PE, Art, ICT, Religion and Modern Languages. The participation of university lecturers, local educational and municipal authorities and associated partners such as GPs, National Food Safety Association experts, sports trainers, etc. will provide the project with outside school expertise and professional ideas and knowledge. The students will be able to learn about the function of voluntary organisations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent. They will also be given opportunity for job shadowing in bio-food stores, farms, sports centres, etc.  The final product Adolescents' Survival Guide to Healthy Lifestyle and the international conference at the closure of the activities will guarantee the dissemination of our outcomes to a wide audience. Through presentations, workshops, surveys and regular communications using collaborative technology between students and teachers we will encourage the development of skills in a range of foreign languages and increase the value which students place on learning of foreign languages. We also aim to improve employability in our young people through improved team-working, communication and expert ICT skills as well as increased confidence and independence. Through the project we will create opportunities for both teachers and students to visit each others\u2019 schools to present findings and participate in workshops. All will experience and learn about different cultures in order to develop an improved understanding of better living through the cultural values of the different institutions and communities. We will involve the religion hygiene, food and mental status requirements as the nine partner schools represent members of four different religions. The partnership will use e-Twinning before the events on the mobility and for the activities. The Healthy Awareness Fair to be organized at the end of each school year will be a place to exhibit everything we have produced and done during the project year. They will al well be a large dissemination tool to advertise ur outcomes.", "http://www.reephamhigh.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BG01-KA219-023739_6"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR10"}
