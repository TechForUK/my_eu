For all these items, countries try to find solutions that are suitable for the national needs, whilst most of these problems/challenges could probably better be solved in a common, European way. Within the project, bridges will be build between people to get to a common, European solution. This explains the title: B2F (Bridges to the future), which is aimed at young people in different countries, building bridges and working out \"best practice\" solutions to meet the described challenges. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nThe emphasis will be on three items that are of great importance for young people:\r\n- School drop-outs \u2013 perspectives and challenges: How do we prevent young people for leaving school without finishing their education and support young teenagers to find a suitable job and create opportunities to strengthen their employability chances ? \r\n- Social inclusion: How do we ensure that people with different social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds can live and work together in a peaceful way? Next to that: how can we help our fellow Europeans in meeting the challenges of growing numbers of refugees and immigrants?\r\n- Juvenile delinquency: What  are the reasons for youngsters to drift into criminality and what can be done to prevent criminality among them, inside and outside school ? \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nApproximately 270 teenagers will directly participate in the project. Many of these teenagers represent different groups like immigrants, refugees, apprenticeship seekers or social minorities. But as the project mainly aims at identifying teenagers for problems outside of school, each teenager is indirectly addressed by this project. To reach a maximum of them, video clips and other information are published via social networks. Furthermore, organizations like employment offices, social care workers, police, advice centres for refugees or other social minorities, local/regional/national authorities as well as other stakeholders are asked to disseminate the campaign throughout their distribution channels. The number of teenagers thereby combines students of partner schools, friends on social networks and teenagers in contact with the different stakeholders.\r\n  \r\nDescription of activities and methodology used:\r\nThe students will investigate the current situation regarding the three fields indicated (one per project year) to gain a sound background knowledge. Therefore, they do not only do research on Internet, but also visit and interview stakeholders like local prison institutions, social care workers, unemployment agencies etc. During students' conferences, students present their results of the national investigations, discuss ways and possibilities to solve these matters and, via peer learning, come to common European solutions by developing best practice examples to use afterwards in their own schools as well as in other pilot-schools and/or institutions concerned by the treated subjects. The students also develop a campaign, consisting of animated video clips, flyers, posters, badges, stickers, etc. Posters and flyers are equipped with a QR-code which automatically links to the e-book, which contains facts and figures and a guidance of recommendation. Furthermore, a \"B2F-Day\" will take place at each school once a year to inform teenagers and stakeholders about the outcomes of the full meetings. Finally, the cooperation of students in an international team is essential, as they need the different background experiences and knowledge to be able to develop an appealing campaign and  best practice advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and impact:\r\nAs the students will be aware of the problems and challenges treated during the project years, its reasons and consequences, activities are planned in order to multiply this awareness to other teenagers. The produced results are used on a B2F-Day, on which students present their investigations and try to catch attention of fellow students as well as other teenagers. Furthermore, results are published on Internet and social networks and given to the stakeholders for display. Thereby it has been tried to identify teenagers for problems they might face in their future and to show them ways to handle these problems. Hopefully, the project partners expect to gain a better employability of teenagers. \r\n\r\nLong term benefits:\r\nAn e-book/portfolio with background knowledge will be published (on Internet as well as social networks for the e-book) and will thereby be visible and available for the following generations of youngsters. The implementation and development of best practice examples and common European solutions in pilot-schools and/or institutions interested will positively have a long-term impact on school politics.", "http://www.redruth.cornwall.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-LU01-KA219-001341_3"]]}}, "2AB": {"esif": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1577750400000, "Smart Tenants", "The Learning Partnership for Cornwall", "This project will develop a range of support and training opportunities to stabilise households and give them the confidence and skills to move towards employment and the opportunity to volunteer to support their peers in the community thus adding to the social capital of the area.", "ESF", 1373905.0, 1717624.0, "esf_england_603"], [1483228800000, 1577750400000, "Living Well: Building Inclusive Labour Markets", "The Learning Partnership for Cornwall", "The Living Well approach to the delivery of health and social care in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly has demonstrated two findings:\n\n i) that a place-based, people-centred approach delivers significant outcomes for individuals and cost-savings to health and social care services (detailed here http://bit.ly/28HFkQw); \n\nii) that the voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector has a major part to play in the design and delivery of key strategic objectives across a range of areas from health and social care to employment.

The original project introduced the schools to each other and allowed one teacher to visit and carry out a job shadowing exercise in the partner school. From this a link was created and small projects linking one class to another have been established. During this project, both schools suggested that more teachers and staff need to visit each school to establish the partnership further across both schools and to utilise the skills and resources that both schools have. This would allow the children in both schools to communicate with others in a different country and learn about the similarities and differences in culture but also to learn Spanish or English (speaking, reading and writing) though a native speaker. One of the ways to encourage and embed languages that was observed in the previous Regio project was teaching language in a cross curricular approach. By observing these practices, staff will be able to see how we can enhance our language skills across the curriculum not just in Spanish alone. This was such a drive in both schools that the part of the project where teachers job shadow each other was established. \r\nThe first part of this project is to enhance and strengthen the staff at Treloweth's Spanish linguistic skills. This is due to Modern Foreign Languages being compulsory for children in Key Stage 2 in England in the 2014 National Curriculum. As a school it is a priority for us to develop and enhance our staff's linguistic capabilities to ensure the children in our care receive the level of Spanish that the Department for Education has set out. \r\nFrom this background the objectives for the project were set out by both schools in co-operation, with Treloweth's Spanish development taking priority due to the change in the curriculum: \r\n- to develop staff knowledge and confidence in speaking and teaching Spanish across KS2\r\n- to develop understanding of Spanish culture to develop cross-curricular links\r\n- to develop children's knowledge and understanding of 'real' Spanish language and pronunciation\r\n- to explore Spanish being taught in different subject areas (CLIL)\r\n- to compare and evaluate teaching methods in both countries to inspire\r\n- to continue the Regio project to develop and deepen the links between the schools (adults and children alike)\r\nAs part of this project, ten participants from Treloweth will be attending a week long intensive language course in Salamanca to enhance their knowledge of Spanish and to use in context. The ten participants are responsible for teaching Spanish to Key Stage 2 in Treloweth and have a varying degree of linguistic knowledge. By attending this course, the level of language will be increased and the quality of Spanish taught to the children will be improved. In the second part of the project, ten participants from Treloweth will be visiting CEIP Diego-Lainez in Almazan, Soria to take part in a job shadowing exercise to experience English being taught under the CLIL initiative. By doing this, the participants will be able to evaluate and reflect on how they can use Spanish in all areas of the curriculum and not just as a stand alone subject.\r\nThe impact of this project will not just be for the participants or Treloweth alone. There are many benefits that both schools will receive from working together and spending time face to face in each others' teaching environments.\r\nIn terms of the participants, we expect each teacher to have increased linguistic competence and confidence in delivering Spanish to the children in their care. The language course will have provided native pronunciation and grammatical skills that they will be able to use to progress the children's language skills further. This will include modelling and reading short pieces of writing.\r\nIn terms of the children, we expect them to have energy and enthusiasm passed on through the participants experiences. Their own linguistic skills will be increased and they will be challenged to apply these skills in terms of reading and writing. The children will also have a wider knowledge of Spanish and European culture through joint projects and exchanges of work and letters between the children at both schools. \r\nIn terms of CEIP Diego-Lainez and Treloweth as a whole, the staff will be in regular contact. This will allow a wider breadth of ideas and resources to be accessed not just restricted to the acquisition of language. A more cross-curricular approach to language teaching will be understood through this project and Spanish will be used in different subjects using CLIL as an excellent example of practice to follow. By carrying out this project, both schools will strengthen their partnership enabling them to go forward and plan more experiences but ultimately this project will benefit the children by uniting them through language.", "http://www.treloweth.sch.uk", "Treloweth Community Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012649_coordinator"]]}}, "3PL": {"esif": {"data": [[1459468800000, 1522454400000, "CETO 6 Wave Hub Project", "CETO Wave Energy UK Ltd", "TDesign, construct, install,operate a single 1 megawatt (MW) grid-connected wave energy converter device, adapted to local conditions and industrialised for large scale deployment at Wave Hub off the north coast of Cornwall.", "ERDF", 312934.0, 481437.0, "erdf_england_515"]]}}, "3QG": {"esif": {"data": [[1483228800000, 1672444800000, "Cornwall CLLD (ERDF)", "Cornwall Development Company Ltd", "This project will deliver the activities identified in the previously approved CLLD strategies -CLLD Projects go straight to Full application, and do not have to submit an Outline", "ERDF", 8716000.0, 11235500.0, "erdf_england_480"], [1443657600000, 1553990400000, "Business Investment for Growth II", "Cornwall Development Company Ltd", "The scheme will co-invest in growth projects brought forward by innovative  businesses.
