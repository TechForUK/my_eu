Our highest priority and main objective  is to increase our teacher's competence and boost confidence in delivering exposure to Modern Languages. \r\n\r\nNumber/Profile of Participants\r\nAfter a presentation and selection process 4 of our teachers were identified as having a clear need to increase their language skills to allow them to gain greater confidence in delivering languages as part of the new curriculum.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nTo complement the training provided by the local authority, the 1 teachers will take part in language immersion activities in France. The course content has been adapted to meet the needs of our teacher provided - language teaching methodology in Early Years Education combined with gaining enhanced skills in the target language, therefore boosting confidence in speaking the target language.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used:\r\nAs head teacher I have identified with my teachers their development needs and looked for  high quality providers to run immersion courses abroad in conjunction with the Institut Francais.\r\nTogether we have developed the course content to the specific needs of our teachers' requirements in line with advice for the new national curriculum in Scotland.\r\nAs head teacher I will monitor the experience of the course - there will be an evaluation of participants by the course provider\r\nand a evaluation of course  by participant.\r\nThrough the evaluation of the course and the subsequent interview with the participating teacher I expect to get a clear picture of how successful / effective the course was.\r\n\r\nDescription of results/impact envisaged:\r\nAs head teacher I expect  longer term benefits as we are looking forward to my teacher becoming more fluent and more confident in their understanding and talking of the target language. Our pupils will greatly benefit from an enthused teacher who is able to speak accurately in the target language and will learn about foreign cultures first hand.", null, "Lumphinnans Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002153_coordinator"], ["9QQ", "Enhancing Employment for Fife Apprentices Through Mobility", "The Cowdenbeath Football Club Limited", 23416.0, "This current project will address key Erasmus+ priorities by targeting and benefiting participants who are at a significant disadvantage in the labour market. \r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 16 Cowdenbeath FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Portugal. The Portuguese host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Portuguese and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and apprentices in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur Portuguese partner and the associated local Portuguese clubs are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. Cowdenbeath FC have previously completed successful self-funded mobility trips and these experiences have formed the foundation for this Erasmus+ funding application.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim of the project will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. These are medium/long term surveys, which will be undertaken by SAFC following completion of mobility. Contact will be maintained with participants on completion of their vocational education and employment status, job description, salary levels and contract status (permanent or fixed term) will be recorded and will be used in the dissemination process. \r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, Cowdenbeath FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK professional football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework.\r\n\r\nCowdenbeath FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility.

Currently one member of staff has the experience and confidence to teach Spanish to a high standard and her support is invaluable to others within the school as she endeavours to share her knowledge and skills with her peers.  This member of staff developed her knowledge through attending a similar course and has gone on to continued professional development through our council.  Following discussions with this key member of staff, the applicant hopes to improve her skills in learning and teaching in Spanish and also use the experience to develop a strong interest within the whole staff team by working alongside the current key member of staff to encourage and develop a firm foundation in the classroom and throughout the school.Having also signed up to the eTwinning website it is hoped that our school will develop real links with a Spanish school so that the children from both communities and cultures can benefit and enhance their Spanish/English speaking experiences.", null, "Cowdenbeath Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023284_coordinator"], ["0LB", "Language Training", "Clentry Nursery School", 1628.0, "At Clentry Nursery we are in the very early stages of implementing the 1+2 strategy.

The applicant will develop a cultural awareness of another European country that will be shared with children, colleagues and parents. Using the E-twinning portal the applicant will work together with teachers in a different European country to share ideas and exchange best practice in teaching a modern language. This will create a European dimension in our nursery with the children being more aware of their place in the wider world.During the immersion course the applicant will develop her understanding of using the Internet and ICT resources to enhance the teaching and learning of modern languages. This learning will be shared with staff in the nursery and all colleagues will be provided with the necessary skills and competences to integrate Spanish into daily routines in the nursery. In the long term this will create a team who work together to develop pedagogical strategies for delivering modern languages to young learners. Learning will also be shared with parents and the wider community by creating an interactive display and by producing a leaflet in an attempt to develop their language skills and engage them in their children's learning.After the immersion course the applicant will evaluate the impact on all learners.
