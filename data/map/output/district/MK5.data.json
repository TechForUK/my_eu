This information will enable improved control and management, resulting in real time synchronization between forces on the ground (police, rescue, firefighters) and out-of-theater command and control centers (C&amp;C). The approach guiding the ESS project is based on the fusion of variable forms of field-derived data within a central system which will then provide information analysis and decision support applications at designated C&amp;C locations. To do this, ESS will achieve the following objectives: i) Improvement of front end data collection technologies (radioactivity, bio-chemical, audio-video, etc.) installed both on portable and fixed platforms, providing a flexible yet comprehensive coverage of the affected area; ii) this data will then be fused and analyzed to provide real-time decision support; iii) ESS will make these resources readily available to commanders through the use of easily accessible web-portals. Thus, ESS will minimize the uncertainty that characterizes crisis events, thereby limiting their scope. The ESS will then be field tested at three different scenarios, including a stadium evacuation, a forest fire and toxic waste dump accidents. The ESS consortium consists of 19 partners that will bring together a wide spectrum of European SME\u2019s, industrial and academic partners from a variety of fields, ranging from sensor design and electronic communications to civil protection. The resulting cooperation will help provide an added measure of security to European citizens. Crisis situations are characterized by partial information according to which commanders need to make life and death decisions. By helping decision makers make decisions based on better and more complete data, ESS will help limit the scope of crises, ultimately saving precious lives.", 416040.0, 12512098.0, 9, 21, "ESS", null, "http://www.apdcomms.com", "/docs/results/images/2014/140154.jpg", "fp7_91016_998028539"]]}}, "8NG": {"cordis": {"data": [[1456790400000, 1546214400000, "Make Net Zero Energy refurbishments for houses a mass market reality", "The National Energy Foundation", "TRANSITION ZERO will make Net Zero Energy (E=0) refurbishments a market reality in the UK, France and The Netherlands.

Building on the same methodology and the inspiring example, a similar innovation trajectory will be facilitated in the UK and France through two deals of 5,000 houses per market and building a pipeline of more demand. \n \nTRANSITION ZERO will organize massive demand for a E=0 refurbishment proposition from social housing organizations, facilitates financers and governments to tune their financing products and regulations towards this product and challenges the construction sector to start an ambitious innovation process to deliver the proposition. The massive demand, the security that there will be finance available and an enabling regulatory environment will de-risk the innovation investment for the builders. \nThe problem to solve to get these propositions to the market is not around technical challenges requiring breakthroughs. The problem is a set of market conditions that are not set right for the innovation process in the construction sector to take off.
