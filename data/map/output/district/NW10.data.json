The project idea comes at a very relevant time, when Europe is not only recovering from the financial crisis, but is also facing another, even bigger, humanitarian crisis. The refugee crisis has not only made the EU reflect on its own solidarity, but it has also spiked up the attention towards the state and rights of young people and children in the whole situation, since integration and creating safe environments, as basic human rights, were at stake in some countries. On the other hand, the momentum was used to remind of other vulnerable groups in our society and the way they have been treated throughout the years , such as LGBTQ population, Children of Alcoholics, young people coming from broken families etc. The objectives of this project are :- to increase the level of awareness among young people about the existence of different vulnerable groups in society- to increase the level of understanding of the different realities and different needs that these vulnerable groups are facing - to introduce a methodology on creating a safe environment for any youth group, following effective and well-known principles that Nordgu has been practicing through the years ( how to create drug-free activities for young people, how to lead youth activity in a tolerant and nondiscriminatory way, how to motivate EU citizenship among young people, how to manage conflict situation, how to practice a rights-based approach etc)- to enable young people to create youth activities and set the tone for non-formal education environments based on the learned methodologies, and their own ideas , creative actions and activity proposals - to introduce a variety of European process and activities for young people, and facilitate the inclusion of the vulnerable groups in these processes- to offer the space for individuals from different European countries to live through European diversity and to develop their own interestsWe believe that this project will be able to put in practice the European values of solidarity, tolerance and equal opportunities, while giving young people an opportunity to expand their level of knowledge about their societies and their competences to work with diverse youth groups and activities.

However, employers require graduates who are prepared in both professional and personal terms to handle tasks and problems in the workplace. The subject Professional experience provides a link between the world of education and work. However, we have noticed that work experience is often only formal and does not bring expected results. Previously we implemented a project of foreign professional experience through mobility, entitled \u201cPraxis abroad improves the school quality\". The impact of the project among all of the parties involved, convinced us that it is indeed the correct way to increase the quality of professional practice and hence also of the professional formation and competencies of the students in order to prepare the graduates for both national and international labor market, and at the same time to increase the prestige of the school. We have therefore decided to continue the implementation of such projects with the new title \"My Mobility - Experience, Expertise, Quality.\"\r\nThe involvement of such students in international projects and their personal experience with working abroad can break stereotypes and broaden the horizons in the area of job diversity within their expertise and rid them of their fears and worries of mobility.\r\n\r\nThe practice will be held in 2 two-weekterms - September 2017 and September 2018 for students of the 4th year in London, Havirov, and Katowice. \u00a0 Students with special educational needs may also apply for the foreign experience of mobility, thereby improving their \u00a0chance to succeed in the labor market and gain an advantage over other candidates.The main objectives of the planned project are to improve vocational education with an emphasis on the compulsory subject of professional experience and other economic subjects in our school, to prepare students for the labor market, to ensure their readiness for lifelong education and thereby improve the indicator of unemployment of our school graduates.\u00a0\r\n\r\nStudents participating in foreign mobility aim to improve their hard and soft skills which are needed in the modern work environment, particularly: improving the ability to work independently, problem solving, enhancing presentation skills, developing verbal and language skills, and improving self-knowledge and self-reflection.The aim of the teaching staff is to gain direct experience with the foreign labor market and with the current requirements of graduates, to expand conceptual and organizational competencies and to improve the management skills of the project team.\r\n\r\nOther objectives of the project are to design and verify the ECVET methodology in the process of preparation, implementation, and evaluation of mobility, to ensure certification through the Europass system, to improve the organization of teaching and learning and integrate new knowledge into the \u0160kVP \u201cgraduate profile\u201d, to implementthe skills and practices acquired by teachersinto the following subjects: professional experience, accounting, business economics, administration and correspondence, English language, and the labor market.\r\n\r\nWe consider the implementation of professional practice in enterprises and organizations in London, Havirov, and Katowice to be the goals concerning students and teachers. Students will have the opportunity to communicate in the real businness environment in person and in written form with business partners and with employees of the company, they will also archive accounting documents, process payrolls, check and register the contracts, carry out business activities and small projects in the area of marketing, update databases, and more. The students will acquire completely new skills and knowledge within the field of modern office equipment and software use.\r\n\u00a0\r\nProject management will carry out project tasks according to the established plan.

After the return of the participants they will write a final report and judge their stay abroad in a feedback session with the Academy of Economics. \r\nDuring the implementation of the activities, the Academy of Economics uses a project management tool to plan and control the following steps described before: Application - Selection and Information - Preparation - Implementation - Monitoring - Evaluation. This leads to a target-oriented project management which integrates measures for unforeseen situations and quality assurance. The financial management of project funds will be managed by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein, which is set up for \r\nthis purpose a particular cost unit. The payment of project funds takes place by the Academy of Economics Schleswig-Holstein. \r\nThe software systems provided by the managing national and European authorities of the ERASMUS+ program for accounting of the \r\nproject, participants registration and maintenance, reporting, Europass-CV and Europass mobility are used during the \r\nimplementation of the project. \r\nTrainees of companies should improve their own linguistic, social, intercultural and technical skills to the effect \r\ncompared to Europe, to be more open and to be more internationalize in thinking and acting. The impact on the daily work will \r\nresult into the fact that companies will focus even more international, remain competitive and develop common standards to act Europe-wide.

Most of our pupils are interested in English. The school provides education in a four-year study programme. The added value of studying at our school is emphasizing the necessity of linking theory to practice through training companies in which students can practically verify their knowledge and skills in a simulated foreign business environment. Furthermore, pupils in the 3rd and 4th grade must complete compulsory vocational practice at the agreed workplaces. This is where we are opening the door to identifying our need to deepen the linking of theory to practice, so that we produce not only theoretical experts for the labour market but especially experienced and practically trained experts with active communication in the English language. In 2017, for the first time in the history of the school, we were able to implement compulsory vocational experience in companies abroad through Erasmus +, KA1 Mobility of VET Learners and Staff. This activity was a great success not only among the 15 pupils who attended it, but also among other pupils and teachers. Moreover, the school has also been successful distinguishing itself from other schools, making it more attractive. Therefore, we decided to continue this activity by submitting another application under this program. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly seen in improving the starting position of future graduates of the secondary school of business in the national and European labour market.\r\nThe aim of this project is to increase the employability of our pupils in the labour market through the realization of foreign vocational mobility which will increase the professional skills and competencies of the pupils. The subject of the project is the realization of foreign mobilities, which will take place in the Czech Republic (specifically in Ostrava) and in England (specifically in London) for a duration of 2 weeks - 10 working days, 14 days together with a journey and a weekend.  It will be attended by 26 pupils together. Through our collaboration with the ADC College in England, 12 of our pupils will be located in companies operating in the Business administration area. As part of mobility in the Czech Republic, pupils will be placed in the following companies: Account Professional, Wincott People, Yakovidis - Klega Partners. The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market. The London internship increased, according to the response of the Day of Open Door in December 2017, the attractiveness of vocational training and the interest in getting high-quality vocational and communication competencies at our school. Last but not least, the image of school has improved, as well as the motivation of pupils from lower grades to acquire vocational and linlinguistic competencies in order to take part in a similar internship.
