Fabrications Limited", "No need for heat! NVP Energy presents the first to market, high-rate AD technology that successfully treats low strength wastewater (WW) at ambient temperatures (4 - 20\u00b0C). The low-temperature anaerobic digestion (Lt-AD) process provides a novel solution to Food and Drinks industrial sectors which produce large volumes of WW. The European milk treatment and processing sector alone generates over 367 billion litres annually which is typically treated using conventional aerobic processes. The latter treatment process is unsustainable. It results in high sludge yields, requires a large footprint on-site and is hugely reliant on fossil fuels for aeration. The Lt-AD technology produces negligible sludge volumes, presents a compact design, requires no heat input or biogas recirculation, and produces effluent of urban wastewater directive (UWWD) standard (< 125 mg/L COD) without post-aeration. Comparing Lt-AD to conventional aerobic treatment of WW from a typical dairy processing plant producing 2,000 m3 WW per day, Lt-AD can provide annual OPEX savings of \u20ac1,662,106 p.a over a payback period of 2.49 years that includes RHI revenue of \u20ac374,176. The low temperature operation of Lt-AD allows for 100% of the biogas produced being available for reuse or resale. Lt-AD also has a high impact on environmental savings through reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and lowered thermal energy and fossil fuels requirements.  This Phase 2 project will allow NVP Energy install and commission a demonstrator plant and gain 8-12 months operational data.

We as a staff believe that training and job-shadowing on a European platform, will be the best motivation staff and pupils will have in implementing the new Action Plan with regards ICT in our school, and developing ICT within International work.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of our project are to:\r\n\r\n*become an e-mature school\r\n\r\n*developing an Virtual Learning Platform through Moodle\r\n\r\n*recognising International and European best practice in ICT\r\n\r\n*developing staff competencies in using ICT\r\n\r\n*developing staff e-confidence\r\n\r\n*Understanding and implementing e-safety in our school \r\n\r\n*developing and promoting the use of iPads and tablets, enabling remote access learning\r\n\r\n*promoting 'Google Apps for Education' as a means of mass storage for pupils\r\n\r\n* sustaining Good Digital Citizenship\r\n\r\nThe whole school staff will be involved in this project.\r\n\r\nWe are 2 full time teachers and a 2 part-time teachers on our staff. We also want to include our ancillary staff and assistants in these mobilities and training, as they will be instrumental in the implementation and success of this project.\r\n\r\nStaff members (6 in total) have varying levels of competencies in ICT- some with basic skills and others with more advanced skills. Our aim is to make sure that no staff member will feel left behind or inadequate in their application of technology. Thus, we have chosen staff training courses of different levels of ability and challenge, to suit the needs of our staff. Combined, these courses will help diffuse the technical challenges of ICT in our school, and promote the attainment of the aims and objectives of the project.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\nWe want to identify the best way that our school can set up a Virtual Learning Platform, and develop our e-maturity.\r\n\r\nWe would like to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\nIs e-maturity within our grasp?\r\n\r\nWill setting up a Virtual Learning Environment benefit the participation and engagement of pupils?\r\n\r\nWill staff e-confidence help promote an e-learning culture within our school?\r\n\r\nAre there advantages in working towards a hybrid classroom?\r\n\r\nCan we overcome issues with e-safety?\r\n\r\nHow can International Policy and best practice help us achieve our vision?\r\n\r\nWill ICT training enhance our teaching?\r\n\r\nWe will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative data to guide our approach.\r\n\r\nWe hope to use descriptive research methodology along with staff, pupil and parent questionnaires during the life of the project. Random sampling of teachers and pupils will be used to obtain a representative sample of attitudes towards our e-maturity project.\r\n\r\nOnce the training and job-shadowing has been completed, we expect the results to be very positive. We expect this project to have a great impact on our staff, pupils and wider school community. We hope to be a school at the fore of e-Learning in our county, and to encourage other schools to also take a leap of faith onto the path of e-maturity. As regards our school, this project will incorporate an important international element that will make our pupils and school community feel less remote and cut-off from our neighbouring counterparts. Living on the periphery of Europe has left us isolated and independent, but through this project we hope to integrate better with our European partners, through networking and face to face encounters.\r\n\r\nPupils will be given opportunities to learn online, on a secure platform, at their own pace. Moodle will be able to engage them for longer, and they will become active participants in their own learning. Assessment of Learning will take place, as others with vested interest in the project will help provide feedback to pupils on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nThe longterm benefits of this project are endless, as we could potentially work with our partners in Spain, United Kingdom and elsewhere on a Moodle collaboration, in which KA2 activities could be conducted. This Virtual Learning Platform would provide an ideal secure platform where pupils and teachers could interact before, during and after their strategic partnership mobilities, and where pupils from a small rural school in Donegal could interact with their peers across Europe, within a common learning theme.\r\n\r\nWith the evolution of technology it is now possible for us to have the whole of Europe at the touch of a button in our classrooms.

Our school is located in Janakkala municipality, close to the city of H\u00e4meenlinna. A nursery school operates in the same premises with the school, nevertheless as an administratively separate unit. Since 2010 our school has run a co-operation program with the pre-school group to make the transition pois from pre-school to primary school as easy as possible. The pupils in pre-school, 1st and 2nd grades are taught environment and nature studies in workshops using mainly co-operative learning and the pupils are divided according to their individual learning styles. The teachers involved in this program work tightly together as a team in planning and teaching the lessons.The results have been very positive and due to them, the cooperation program of co-teaching environment and nature studies cross-curricularly and putting different age groups together in one teaching group will be widened to concern the upper grades in our school, too. For the transition in the teaching method it would be essential for our teachers to visit other European schools and see how team teacing, co-teaching and teaching environment and nature studies as a subject itself is implemented. This would be the first main focusing point of our project. We have planned two job-shadowing periods in two European schools and the idea is that each teacher in our school will attend a 5-day job-shadowing period in either of these schools and learn new procedures, ways of teaching, positive attitudes towards teamwork and of course positive attitudes towards international co-operation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second main focus is ICT. ICT skills are used in every subject at school and both teachers and pupils need to learn vital digital skills. To be able to teach our pupils safe and varied uses of ICT, the teachers need constantly to be trained to be familiar with the new possibilities. Social media and its devices are strongly present at people's everyday life. Smartphones and tablets with cloud services offer endless possibilities also for educational purposes. How to effectively use the social media, cloud services, tablets, smart phones and for example a learning database in teaching, will be the areas in which we would like to improve our teachers' skills in the future. Being able to use the assistive technologies and special applications for tablets and smartphones will also give us another mean to differentiate, help and support pupils with learning difficulties. The planned action in this project will be two separate courses aimed at the teaching staff to improve their skills at using tablets and the educational applications available, and moreover, to learn to make our own applications which we can use specifically for the benefit of our pupils. The courses are arranged in Belgium and Austia and four members of our teaching staff will attend these 5-day courses. The teachers will be selected mainly based on their motivation and need for improving their professional skills.\r\n\r\nAs the third \"silent\" focus in this project we see internationalization. Our school has been actively involved with Comenius cooperation since 2000 and we are proud of  that. Working on different Comenius projects have brought Europe closer to our staff and pupils, made them more aware, and at the same time also curious, about other European countries and cultures and, most importantly, dispelled a lot of prejudices agains different cultures. Making new contacts and being able to discuss with European colleagues face-to face in this project will evolve new ideas for further cooperation in the future. \r\n\r\nThe planned co-teaching project in our school will be carried our in any case in the near future and we think that this European mobility project will help our teachers to adjust to the idea of cooperation and teacmwork. The impacts of job-shadowing activites will be shown in the teachers' everyday work,  opening positive attitudes towards teamwork, co-teaching possibilites, and positive attitudes towards European co-operation. The planned courses for our staff will improve the teachers' ICT skills and by learning from each other we will gain another mean to differentiate and thus motivate our pupils.

We have observed in our own school a drop in the level of language with which our pupils enter the school system, seeing how our colleagues work developing early language skills we believe will be of benefit.\r\nNumeracy- Finland and Spain-We have observed how Finland uses learning styles as a basis to sort pupils into groups, with no regress to age and we feel that this approach would work with our proposed CPA approach to Maths. And both schools are working with 3rd level Institutes and we will have the opportunity to share expertise in the field of 'Action Research'.\r\nICT: Finland and Republic of Ireland, our colleagues in these schools use 2 different approaches to ICT provision within their schools, Finland has a designated ICT suite, something which we are in the process of developing and Republic of Ireland has a BYO device approach where pupils bring their own tablets, devices to school for use.

Viewpoints to Multiculturalism\u201d is a joint student and teacher mobility project coordinated by Salpaus Further Education and realized by Sanare, a network of Finnish vocational institutions and education providers. The network partners are Finland\u2019s Diaconia College, The Federation of Education in Jokilaaksot/Ylivieska Vocational College, South Ostrobothnia Folk High School, Rovaniemi Municipal Federation of Education/Lapland Vocational College, The Federation of Education in Central Ostrobothnia, and Kemi-Tornionlaakso Municipal Educational and Training Consortium Lappia/Vocational College Lappia. The project is carried out in co-operation with our foreign partners in Spain, Denmark, Czech Republic and the UK. In choosing the partners, versatility has been taken into account to the effect that there are on-the-job learning places both for practical nursing students and for youth and leisure instructor students. In addition, the foreign partners have experience of multiculturalism, the central theme in the current project. The on-the-job learning places are in day care centres, schools and in care units for the elderly and the disabled. In the \u201cVlog Up!\u201d project there will be altogether 54 student mobilities and 14 staff mobilities.  \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has carried out international projects previously, too, the most recent one being the Erasmus+ KA1 project \u201cIlona \u2013 voluntary work as part of the welfare field\u201d (2015-17). The previous experiences in collaboration act as a starting point in the current project. Thus, the practices that have proved to be good previously, as well as the designation of assignments within the network, are adopted to efficient use in the current project.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase the knowledge possessed by the applying network and the collaborating working life networks about the opportunities and challenges of multiculturalism in the European partner countries and in this way promote a new kind of European sense of community and equality. This goal is reached through video blogs, or vlogs, produced by the students taking part in the mobility periods. \r\n\r\nThe Sanare network has international partners, of which the ones chosen to be in this project are the ones with the most experience of supervising students from different cultural backgrounds and in whose staff and/or clients the multicultural dimension has traditionally been present. \r\n\r\nAs the concrete result of the project there will be, in addition to the mobility weeks, video blogs made by the participating students. In these vlogs, the various manifestations and forms of multiculturalism, as encountered in the on-the-job learning places abroad, are recorded and presented. The vlogs are recorded using for example cameras, smartphones and tablets. The students will update the vlogs in real time during the on-the-job learning periods. The vlogs will be advertised on the websites of the participating colleges. The vlogs can also be used for example in the marketing campaigns of the colleges, in parents\u2019 nights, and in staff education. \r\n\r\nThe mobility periods are recognized using the Europass mobility certificate. In addition, the mobility periods are recognized as on-the-job learning periods belonging to the students\u2019 qualifications as an obligatory part. \r\n\r\nThe various activities of the project are planned in detail in the autumn of 2017. At the same time, orientation is arranged for the first students going abroad in the spring of 2018. The staff mobility periods will take place in an early stage of the project, mostly in the autumn of 2017.

The general aim of this training course is to foster excellence in education by empowering teachers, trainers, headmasters and other education staff to improve their stress management skills together with other teachers and education staff throughout all Europe gaining as well  a broader understanding of education in Europe and exchanging best practices and experiences. \r\n\r\nWith such a huge amount of time spent in the classroom, schools provide an ideal environment for promoting good emotional wellbeing and identifying early behaviour changes and signs of mental distress. The social and emotional skills, knowledge and behaviours that young people learn in the classroom can help them to build resilience and set the pattern for how they will manage their mental health throughout their lives. Research has found that parents of children with mental health problems are most likely to seek advice or help from a teacher rather than any other professionals.
