The domestic sector is of major significance, as it will reduce reliance on large centralized energy plants. There are several domestic options including solar thermal, solar electric, heat pump and biomass systems. Of these, solar and heat pump technologies have the widest potential application as they require no physical feedstock. However, despite steady market growth, these technologies still make up only a small fraction of total household energy supply. One of the main reasons for this is the initial investment required, coupled with uncertainty over return on investment. This is compounded by the huge range of available products and a lack of objective information relating to system performance.  As a result, consumers are often confused and unable to make informed decisions. In addition, installation companies often experience difficulties when advising customers on the various options and their respective benefits. Hence, despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, there exists a significant knowledge and confidence barrier that restricts increased market acceptance.  In order to address this problem, we propose to develop a system that can automatically provide accurate and objective information about the suitability of a renewable energy technology for a given user scenario. The system will be intuitive and easy to use employing a unique dynamic grading technology. This will enable consumers to make better informed decisions and will allow our membership to provide better service. This will help to significantly increase market penetration and revenues for our pan-European membership involved in the design, manufacture and installation of domestic renewable energy technologies.'", 154775.0, 2572890.0, 7, 14, "EAGLE", "http://www.eagle-fp7.eu", "http://www.solartech.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/153217.jpg", "fp7_101434_963152480"]]}}, "3PL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1391212800000, 1496188800000, "Innovative methodology for small populations research", "Clinical Trials Consulting & Training Limited", "The HEALTH.2013.4.2-3 call identifies a need for new or improved statistical methodology for clinical trials for the efficient assessment of safety and/or efficacy of treatment for small population groups.  This project brings together international experts in innovative clinical trial design methodology in these specific areas along with key stakeholders including regulatory authorities, industry, clinicians and patient groups to address this need.  Our aim is the development novel methodology for the design and analysis of clinical trials in small populations.  We will focus on four specific areas where we believe there are particular challenges: (i) early phase dose-finding studies in small populations, (ii) decision-theoretic methods for clinical trials in small populations, (iii) confirmatory trials in small populations and personalised medicines, (iv) use of evidence synthesis in the planning and interpretation of clinical trials in small populations and rare diseases.\n\nWe will build on recent research advances, of our own and of others in this area.  In the rare disease setting, we will focus on Bayesian and decision-theoretic methods that formally enable comparison of the gain in information with the cost, both in economic and opportunity terms, of clinical experimentation, and assess how information from outside the trial can formally be incorporated in the design and decision-making processes.  In the personalised medicine setting, we will develop methods that allow evaluation of efficacy in a number of sub-populations simultaneously in a confirmatory clinical trial without any reduction in scientific or statistical rigour.", 43032.0, 2304595.0, 5, 8, "InSPiRe", null, "http://www.CTCT-Ltd.co.uk", null, "fp7_110064_950433937"], [1420070400000, 1546214400000, "Improving Design, Evaluation and Analysis of early drug development Studies", "Clinical Trials Consulting & Training Limited", "Drug development is a long and costly process which suffers from the major shortcoming that frequently failure is often only\ndetermined during the final stage. Recently, it has been recognised that more care needs to be taken during the early stages\nof development to avoid going into lengthy and costly confirmatory studies with ineffective or harmful treatments. To achieve\nthis goal it is essential to implement efficient methods for the design and analysis of such early development studies. The\nexpertise in this area is, however, limited at the moment and adequate methodology is only partially available. Using a\ncross-sectorial, transnational approach, the IDEAS network brings together leading public and private sector researchers in\nthe field with ample experience in training to educate, promote and support the future leaders in medical statistics in general\nand in the design and analysis of early developmental studies in particular.\n\nWithin the network, cross-sectorial, transnational teams will support young researchers with individual methodological\nprojects and devise an individually tailored training programme for them. Clinical advisors supplement the input of the\nsupervisory team and ensure practical relevance and uptake of the methods devised. The training activities are comprised of\na well-rounded mix of specialist, methodological components and generic, transferable skills. A mandatory set of networkwide\ntraining activities is supplemented by individual training components and cross-sectorial secondments, and particular\nattention is given to interaction and collaboration between researchers and supervisors across public and private sector\npartners.
