Following this success, we want to develop an increased sense of European awareness to our school by introducing a second language, French, into the Key Stage 2 timetable.  We currently find that our focus on just one other country is a narrow one and wish to broaden our European outlook as well as broaden the horizons of our students. In order to ensure that the quality is as high as our current Spanish programme, we are looking to send our language teacher on a French language immersion course during the summer so that he is ready to teach French when the new school year begins in September. We are looking to deliver French through another subject just as we do now with Spanish and therefore it is crucial that his level of language is as fluent as possible. Just as we have done with Spanish, we will be providing in class training our non-specialist teachers so that French can also be integrated into the daily life of the school.

The future graduates do not only have to be ideally prepared for starting their career but they also need to be able to deal with the most different circumstances. Thanks to the Erasmus+ Project our students have a much clearer und comprehensible idea of the international job market and its demands. The effort which Tourism Schools Salzburg take in order to enable their students to go abroad is particularly emphasized by the internationally-oriented professional training in the classic disciplines such as service, kitchen, bar and reception. The subject-specific training at the schools matches top-quality standards and is targeted at the demands of the international tourism economy. Specific objectives are amongst other things an improved fluency in the foreign languages as well as increased skills in the areas kitchen, service, bar and reception of the respective country\u2019s culture and language. The cultural exchange and the personal responsibility which the students experience during an internship encourage the personal development and strengthen the self-confidence. The young people have to deal with topics such as mobility and cultural variety which, as a consequence, broadens their horizon as far as political topics of the EU are concerned and increases their interest to actively look into these matters. About 30 students from all 4 school locations of Tourism Schools Salzburg participate in this mobility program. Due to their training, they all have several years of experience in the areas kitchen, service, bar and reception. During the summer months the students will work in tourism related areas of the hotel and tourism economy and will demonstrate the skills which they have acquired at school. This project is characterized by an intense and permanent communication with the project coordinators of Tourism Schools Salzburg. During the project \u2013 before, during and after the internship - an active communication in this triangle between the organization sending the student, the partner company and the student will be necessary. This continuous communication will deliver valuable information for evaluation purposes and can also even affect the design of the curriculum at the schools. The target is a sustainable cooperation with the partners abroad which is documented by the respective Memorandum of Understanding. As a result, the Schools will benefit from having permanent partners abroad, the partners will benefit from the excellent know-how of the students and last but not least the students will be able to increase their competitiveness on the job market. The project results can be perfectly used for professional media relations and serve to improve the Schools image. Moreover, it motivates the students to look into the mobility offers.
