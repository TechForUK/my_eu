A particularly well-understood model system for studying the mechanisms of morphogen-mediated patterning is the vertebrate neural tube. Here, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) induces discrete neuronal progenitor domains through regulation of a combinatorial code of transcription factors. The observed precision and reproducibility of gene expression appears greater than can be accounted for by the precision of Shh signalling alone. Thus, mechanisms must exist that filter signaling noise. We hypothesize that this involves either the properties of the downstream transcriptional network regulated by Shh signaling or active cell sorting.\nThe proposed research project aims at quantifying the amount of noise in the pattern of gene expression in the vertebrate neural tube, and investigating how, at which level, and to which extent this noise is buffered. To achieve this goal, I will generate fluorescent reporters for the expression of three key Shh target genes, Nkx2.2, Olig2 and Pax6, and spatiotemporally correlate the activity of these reporters with Shh pathway activity. In parallel, a quantitative analysis of the behaviour of cells will be performed to elucidate the contribution of differential cell adhesion and active cell sorting. The combined results will be integrated into a theoretical framework to account qualitatively and quantitatively for Shh-mediated patterning of the neural tube.\nDue to the iterative deployment of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling during animal development and the evolutionary conservation of the Hh pathway, the types of mechanisms deduced from our quantitative analysis will probably not only apply to Shh-mediated patterning in the neural tube, but to a broad range Hh-mediated patterning processes.

The haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of influenza viruses mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes at the pH of the endosome to deliver the viral genome into the cytosol. Despite its high surface variability, its fusion machinery is conserved among HA subtypes and is a prime target for broadly neutralizing antibodies. HA consists of the receptor-binding HA1 and the fusion-mediating HA2, which has two membrane-interacting elements: the N-terminal fusion peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane anchor. At low pH, HA2 undergoes a series of conformational changes that project the fusion peptide out of a protein pocket towards the target membrane, and subsequently bring fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor, and likely the two membranes, into close proximity. The conformational changes are defined by crystal structures at neutral and low pH, but the membrane-associated parts of the protein were absent from the crystallization constructs.

As a counter-defense, viruses deploy viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs). Well-established in plants and invertebrates, the existence of antiviral RNAi in mammals has remained unknown until our recent findings (from my first postdoctoral studies) that undifferentiated mouse cells infected with Encephalomyocarditis virus or Nodamuravirus accumulate 22-nt long siRNAs. These derived from viral dsRNA replication-intermediates, incorporated into AGO2, were eliminated in Dcr knockout cells, and decreased in abundance upon cell differentiation. We further showed that genetically ablating a NoV-encoded VSR that antagonizes DCR during authentic infections reduces NoV accumulation, which is rescued in RNAi-deficient mouse cells. We concluded that antiviral RNAi operates in mammalian cells. One of the key findings from this study was that antiviral RNAi operates in undifferentiated but not in differentiated cells. Our main hypothesis for this discrepancy is that, in mammalian cells, virus infection triggers other defense systems that are not sequence-specific by nature -such as the interferon (IFN) response- and that these defense pathway may mask the effects of RNAi. Accordingly long dsRNA-triggered RNAi is active in mESCs, which are known to be defective in their IFN response. Alternatively, DCR and/or its cofactors involved in dsRNA processing might be insufficient in differentiated cells.

In-depth analysis of tumour genomes is revealing evidence for branched evolution and cancer subclonal spatial and temporal intratumour heterogeneity (ITH). Drivers of ITH such as chromosomal instability (CIN) are associated with drug resistance and poor clinical outcome. However, despite increasing knowledge of tumour diversity, there is limited insight into the mechanisms driving genomic instability and ITH or the processes that shape cancer genome evolution over time and space. Many animal tumour models fail to recapitulate patterns of genomic instability witnessed in human tumours, limiting insight into the forces that shape tumour evolution in vivo. We have found evidence for parallel subclonal evolution, resulting in the same gene or signal transduction pathway being subject to distinct inactivating or activating somatic events in different regions of the same tumour (Gerlinger NEJM 2012).

The influence on the whole population of environmental factors is undoubtedly powerful, but one remarkable feature of the obesity epidemic is the persistence of enormous individual variation in body weight throughout the population. Individual differences seem to be increasing in both children and adults, with the lean staying lean while the obese become more obese, which indicates that individuals interact differently with the \u2018obesogenic\u2019 environment. There is strong evidence that within a population the variance in weight is largely genetically determined. Given that common obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, it is highly likely that this interaction occurs partly through individual variation in appetite and eating behaviours.

As part of this proposal I propose a complementary gene finding strategy that focuses on the lowest end of the BMI distribution in order to find genes that confer resistance to obesity in an obesogenic society.

The 18-member project ran from early 2011 to early 2014.\n\nThe consortium investigated five key areas of innovation. One approach was to adapt a lean manufacturing concept (meaning to reduce production waste) to rail usage. The concept was applied to key track maintenance processes, including tamping, grinding, and switches and crossings (S&C) maintenance. Initial comparison of best practices of several European rail agencies highlighted potential technologies that could reduce maintenance times.\n\nA second area of focus was inspection technologies. The project concluded that continuous, daily track monitoring was possible using in-service trains running at normal speeds. Project partners developed a laser-based trolley for assessing S&Cs, and the associated algorithms. The project's switch inspection device will also be able to monitor tack geometry. The prototype was shown to be able to assess approximately 130 switches per night, compared with 5 per day using traditional methods. The new method does not disrupt rail traffic and has no safety concerns.\n\nThe project also applied a lean analysis to typical grinding shifts, and identified several efficiency improvements. Measures included encouraging use of track-friendly vehicle designs, setting maintenance targets that address repair longevity, and setting performance standards that do not damage rails. AUTOMAIN also suggested similar improvements to servicing of modular S&Cs, and to planning and scheduling.\n\nInnovative improvements highlighted by the project reduce the maintenance track possession time by up to 40\u00a0%. The saved time is then available for freight usage, resulting in an improvement to rail traffic efficiency and increased capacity.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/149610.jpg", "fp7_97333_999540963"], ["2DN", "Future Of Surface Transport Research Rail", "Network Rail Infrastructure Limited", "FOSTER RAIL addresses the broad support challenges of SST.2013.6-1.

In particular, negative prices were found to induce non-normal and, importantly, time-varying shapes of the probability distribution.\n\nProject results were based on the German market, which has set the lead in fighting climate change with renewable energy technologies. The negative prices signified lack of investment in flexible power generation and, most importantly, absence of market coupling. For instance, cheaper electricity generation or negative prices in Germany can help meet demand and reduce prices in neighbouring countries.\n\nAnother focus was on worldwide regulatory practices regarding the electricity and gas sectors. AADAMS revealed the potential to form a trans-governmental network for energy policy that is able to affect the adoption of best practices.\n\nTo enhance understanding of the abnormal price dynamics in wholesale electricity prices, AADAMS considered day-ahead markets, exercise of market power and policy interventions.\n\nThe increasing share of renewable energies for electricity generation such as wind and solar photovoltaic is an important driver due to the intermittency of the energy source. AADAMS extensively investigated the phenomena of negative prices on power exchange and the behaviour of electricity markets with high renewable energy shares.

RTIs affecting the lung parenchyma (pneumonia) can be classified into three main categories: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP); Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) which includes Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP); and opportunistic pathogens causing pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients (Opportunistic RTIs or ORTIs). RTIs are difficult to diagnose accurately and current standard microbiological culture based tests are laborious and time consuming with a turnaround time to results > 30 hours.

An analysis of such frictions will add vastly to our understanding of how institutions make decisions and will also allow us to explore the implications of these decisions for asset prices.

I am unique in explicitly linking such models to empirical testing.\nTheory: \u201cLearning, Capital Structure and Systemic Risk.\u201d Standard dynamic structural models of financing assume firms know the stochastic process governing cash flow. I will first consider a partial equilibrium model. Here firms are exposed to rare event risk, with the true probability being unknown. Firms learn and update beliefs regarding risk. Relative to standard models, firms are debt conservative and there is leverage persistence. In many cases, firms increase leverage only if they have avoided a negative shock long enough. In order to analyze asset pricing implications, I plan to embed such firms in a general equilibrium setting with a common catastrophic risk having unknown probability. Firms rationally respond to \u201cGreat Moderations\u201d by increasing leverage. Recessions are more severe after long tranquil periods due to high debt overhang. A third paper, Re-Examining the Link Between Leverage and Systematic Risk, considers cross sectional asset pricing implications of credit shocks. The standard levered beta formula is erroneous, and the pre-tax cost of capital increases with debt. Together, the models show privately optimal debt is lower than recognized, and that tax breaks for debt reduce welfare.\nEmpirical Testing: \u201cNatural Experiment Policy Evaluation\u2014A Structural Critique.\u201d A common approach to testing whether taxes influence corporate financing and investment decisions is to compare leverage and investment before/after tax changes. I use a structural model as a laboratory to show that lack of a statistically significant change is not sufficient to reject the null that \u201ctaxes matter.\u201d I will first consider an economy where the tax rate is a Markov process. Flotation costs on debt and real irreversibility limit the response of financing and investment to changes in shadow prices. More importantly, responses to tax changes are attenuated whenever they are partially anticipated and not permanent. Standard tests violate rational expectations by implicitly assuming tax changes come as surprises, with each new change being viewed as permanent, until the next surprise. My argument implies that standard tax experiments cannot falsify the null that taxes affect behaviour. Further, one cannot generalize elasticities if the policy transition matrix differs. I will propose an alternative Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing. My argument casts doubt on standard interpretations of historical evidence of tax change effects, suggesting true elasticities may be much higher.

This polarity abolishes the uniform distribution of antigen vesicles between daughter cells, generating two functionally different B cells.\nThis proposal is focused on understanding how this initial antigen polarity is established and maintained and what is its role in B cell activation.

A-T patients display immune deficiencies, cancer predisposition and radiosensitivity. The molecular role of ATM is to respond to DNA damage by phosphorylating its substrates, thereby promoting repair of damage or arresting the cell cycle. Following the induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs), the NBS1 protein is required for activation of ATM. But ATM can also be activated in the absence of DNA damage. Treatment of cultured cells with hypotonic stress leads to the activation of ATM, presumably due to changes in chromatin structure. We have recently described a second ATM cofactor, ATMIN (ATM INteractor). ATMIN is dispensable for DSBs-induced ATM signalling, but ATM activation following hypotonic stress is mediated by ATMIN. While the biological role of ATM activation by DSBs and NBS1 is well established, the significance, if any, of ATM activation by ATMIN and changes in chromatin was up to now completely enigmatic.\nATM is required for class switch recombination (CSR) and the suppression of translocations in B cells. In order to determine whether ATMIN is required for any of the physiological functions of ATM, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse model for ATMIN. ATM signaling was dramatically reduced following osmotic stress in ATMIN-mutant B cells. ATMIN deficiency led to impaired CSR, and consequently ATMIN-mutant mice developed B cell lymphomas. Thus ablation of ATMIN resulted in a severe defect in ATM function. Our data strongly argue for the existence of a second NBS1-independent mode of ATM activation that is physiologically relevant.

This necessitates an in-depth understanding of the biology and life cycle of the parasite.\n\nThe EU-funded MALSIG project was initiated to characterise the molecular components of signalling pathways implicated in the life cycle of malaria parasites. To this end, the consortium focused on three stages of the parasite life cycle \u2014 erythrocyte (red blood cell) invasion, sexual development and hepatocytes\u2019 (liver) infection. Detailed information can be found on the http://www.malsig.lille.inserm.fr/ (project) website.\n\nProject results elucidate the importance of various second messengers (calcium, cAMP and phospholipase C) and protein kinases (CDPK5 and PKG) in the erythrocyte invasion stage. The subcellular location and assembly of the parasite motor complex was also delineated, providing detailed information on its development. Besides identifying a host erythrocyte signalling pathway and several protein kinases critical for parasite survival, a scalable transfection tool was developed for testing drug efficacy.\n\nUsing reverse genetics and knockout lines, the consortium proceeded to elucidate the signalling components, effector molecules and stage-specific processes implicated in the parasite's sexual development. Calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) in P.falciparum was found to be indispensable during the sexual stages of its life cycle. The effector Alveolin IMC1h was essential for normal motility behaviour and accessing the bloodstream. MALSIG research revealed that infected erythrocytes are more deformable than immature ones, possibly playing an important role in P. falciparum gametocyte development in the host.\n\nVarious transgenic parasite strains were generated by researchers for molecular analysis of the parasite\u2013host cell interaction during the liver-infecting phase of the parasite.This enabled scientists to elucidate the function of parasite proteins and their localisation in different stages of liver invasion and infection. A novel role for the messenger phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) was identified in the digestion of haemoglobin and acquisition of essential amino acids by P. falciparum.\n\nTaken together, MALSIG project findings provided a series of signalling, trafficking, motility and transporter molecules that are essential for specific stages of the life cycle of the malaria parasite.

Therefore, uncovering the spatio-temporal heterogeneity, i.e., when, where, and how melanoma cells respond to drug and acquire resistance in a complex tumour microenvironment is the key step toward the comprehensive understanding of resistance mechanisms. To tackle these problems, we will investigate the tolerance and resistance to B-Raf inhibitors with single cell resolution in vivo.

In vitro, the melanoma cells show homogenous responses to BRaf inhibitors, whereas intravital analysis indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in ERK activity within tumours.

DNA double-strand breaks  are cytotoxic and are repaired either by Non Homologous End-Joining or Homologous Recombination (HR). HR provides an important function in DNA repair, where it serves the dual purpose of mending broken chromosomes and recovering sequence information that might be lost at sites of DNA breaks. The recombination process is initiated by exchange of strands between two homologous DNA duplexes (in mitotic cells, recombination generally occurs between two sister chromatids) and the resulting joint molecules can mature into four-way structures known as Holliday junctions. Similar DNA intermediates can be generated during DNA replication via regression of stalled replication forks, which may create a requirement for HJ resolution/dissolution during replication. The primary mechanism of HJ processing involves the BTRR complex which \u2018dissolves\u2019 HJs to form non-crossovers, a reaction that is critical to avoid loss of heterozygosity and tumourigenesis.

It kills more than 2000 people in the UK every year but an effective cure for metastatic disease does not exist yet.\nThe mutation of valine to glutamic acid at position 600 (V600E) of the BRAF kinase is found in over 60% of human melanomas, establishing it as a prominent oncogene in melanoma. Since this mutation is also commonly identified in benign and dysplastic nevi, the hypothesis is that additional mutations are required to induce melanomagenesis. Thus, a first challenge in the field is to identify those genetic events cooperating with oncogenic BRAFV600E in melanoma development, and exploit novel targets for combinatorial therapies.\nFurthermore, the discovery of a central role for the BRAFV600E mutation in melanoma has led to the development of BRAFV600E-specific drug inhibitors. Initial clinical trials report extremely promising tumour regressions in the majority of patients. However, all patients eventually relapse after several months of treatment as a result of acquired resistance. I postulate that the therapeutic inhibition of BRAFV600E alone allows tumour cells to acquire additional yet unknown mutations that finally induce drug resistance and cancer\u2019s regrowth. Therefore a second challenge is to understand the genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms responsible for the drug resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors, which currently represent the most promising treatment option for melanoma. The aim of this project is to use novel mouse models of melanoma that develop in the setting of a Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis to identify (i) genes cooperating with oncogenic BRAFV600E to promote melanoma and (ii) genes accountable for the development of drug resistance against BRAFV600E inhibitors.\nOverall, the expected results in understanding the mechanisms of both melanomagenesis and resistance to BRAFV600E inhibitors will provide novel opportunities to develop effective melanoma therapeutics.", 173711.0, 173711.0, "Melanoma Genes", "Novel mutations in melanoma", "Melanoma constitutes one of the most frequent cancers with a high morbidity rate.

However, the discovery of transforming mutations is complicated by the abundance of passenger mutations caused by ultraviolet light exposure.\n\nSeeking to address this issue, scientists on the EU-funded 'Gene discovery in melanoma progression and therapeutic resistance' (MELANOMA GENES) project used an animal model of the disease. This transgenic mouse harboured the human BRAF protein mutation specifically in mouse melanocytes and presented skin hyperpigmentation and melanoma formation.\n\nThe long latency of cancer onset in this mouse presented an ideal scenario for screening for driver mutations. Researchers bred this mouse with the mouse that carries the Sleeping Beauty transposon, a DNA element capable of jumping between positions in the genome. They observed a significant acceleration of tumourigenesis and analysed the transposon insertion sites to identify the genes responsible for this observation.\n\nA list of genes with established roles in the formation of melanoma were identified. The Enhancer of Polycomb\u00a01 (EPC1) gene was one of the most commonly altered genes, and given its involvement in other cancers scientists decided to further explore its role as a tumour suppressor in melanoma. Suppression of EPC1 expression significantly affected melanoma cell proliferation and transformation.\n\nFurthermore, the consortium was interested in unveiling the genes responsible for drug resistance. In this context, they treated melanoma mice with a BRAF inhibitor and waited for the emergence of drug-resistant tumours. Genomic sequencing identified eight genetic loci that were mutated following drug treatment. Functional evaluation of these genes indicated the involvement of the PI3K pathway in the emergence of drug resistance.\n\nApart from providing fundamental insight into the genetic aetiology of melanoma, the findings of the MELANOMA GENES study have clinical implications.

CoralFISH will:  i) develop essential methodologies and indicators for baseline and subsequent monitoring of closed areas, ii) integrate fish into coral ecosystem models to better understand coral fish-carrying capacity, iii) evaluate the distribution of deepwater bottom fishing effort to identify areas of potential interaction and impact upon coral habitat, iv) use genetic fingerprinting to assess the potential erosion of genetic fitness of corals due to long-term exposure to fishing impacts, v) construct bio-economic models to assess management effects on corals and fisheries to provide policy options, and vi) produce as a key output, habitat suitability maps both regionally and for OSPAR Region V to identify areas likely to contain vulnerable habitat.

This responded directly to a call by the UN General Assembly Resolution 61/105 to prevent impacts from bottom fishing on VMEs in the world's oceans.\n\nSustainable exploitation and management of marine resources and conservation of fragile habitats requires data on where VMEs occur and an understanding of how these ecosystems function and how fish interact with them.\n\nIn Europe's offshore waters, the main VMEs are cold-water corals and sponge habitats. Although these environments are important to commercial fish, with 63 species recorded there, they are easily damaged by fishing activities. Failure to manage fisheries without taking into account a larger ecosystem perspective can therefore have economic consequences for fisheries. This is because habitat loss over time will result in a decrease in the amount of fish that can be supported.\n\nThe field intensive CORALFISH project collected data during 27 research expeditions enabling the production of the first comprehensive catalogue of seafloor maps of European coral habitat. The development of standard methodologies and tools, including \u2018COVER\u2019 \u2013 software to improve the standard annotation of video - and semi-automated GIS classification tools, ensured uniformity of map production.\n\nNotwithstanding this impressive effort to collect new data, the footprint of sampled seafloor remains minuscule at the scale of ocean basins. The CORALFISH project therefore developed innovative mapping and predictive modelling approaches to compensate for the paucity of knowledge of biology over vast areas of the world's oceans.\n\nNovel habitat suitability models enabled the production of predicted habitat distribution maps of corals at global, regional and local levels.  These maps can be used as decision support tools for policymakers and planners involved in offshore spatial planning in areas where little field data is available.\n\nOutputs from the CORALFISH project have made an important contribution to the debate surrounding the future viability of deep-sea fisheries in Europe and will in the future contribute to planned initiatives as part of the European Commission's maritime strategy.", null, "http://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/ioz/index.htm", "/docs/results/images/2015/148061.jpg", "fp7_89331_998797167"], ["2BE", "Functional and evolutionary studies of the glutamatergic synapse; a proteomic and genetic approach", "Genome Research Limited", "Glutamatergic neurons are the main excitatory nerve cells in the central nervous system of mammals, in this project we aim to better understand the molecular composition of their synapses.

Understanding the evolution of the synapse by studying species differences. 3. Characterising the human hippocampal glutamatergic synapse.   These objectives will be addressed using a combination of proteomic and bioinformatic systems biology. In all cases we will isolate the protein complexes of interest and investigate its molecular composition by mass spectrometry. For the first objective we want to compare wild type mice with a series of KO for important proteins in learning and memory; we expect to better understand the role of the KO molecules in those cognitive processes. We also want to study the evolution of the glutamatergic synapse; we propose to characterize the same set of protein complexes that we studied in mice in other species, especially in humans. We believe that evolutionary studies will be a way to work out the important proteins for higher cognitive functions and we hope to describe the human synapse composition for the first time.

Roughly synchronous egress of blood stage parasites in vivo causes the periodic fevers associated with malaria and is essential for parasite replication. Blocking parasite egress can stop disease progression, so understanding its mechanism is key to identifying new drug targets. Egress of malaria parasites from host erythrocytes involves the rupture of two membranes- the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the erythrocyte membrane. It is unclear how the parasitophorous vacuole membrane ruptures during egress, and what mechanism is responsible for poration of the erythrocyte membrane. While it has been shown that egress is protease-dependent, the effector molecules that bring about the disruption of both membranes remain unknown. Potential effector molecules include parasite perforin-like proteins (PLPs) and phospholipases.  This project aims to test the hypothesis that Plasmodium PLPs and phospholipases are involved in malarial egress. First, we will apply newly developed conditional knockout strategies to establish the role in egress of a candidate perforin-like protein.

The best-characterized KRAS effector pathway, the ERK cascade consists of RAF, MEK and ERK proteins that can be inhibited with small molecules targeting their kinase activities. As the development of RAF and MEK kinases inhibitors progressed, feedback loop reactivating the ERK cascade have emerged, inducing resistance to treatment. Thus, new innovative strategies are needed to achieve a more long-term inhibition of this signalling pathway, while reducing detrimental side effects due to MAPK inhibition in normal cells. It has been described more than 20 years ago that RAF directly interacts with RAS through its Ras Binding Domain (RBD), and many research groups have been trying to disrupt this interaction developing allosteric inhibitors as a cancer therapy. At the moment, those molecules need to be improved in order to achieve a strong inhibition of this pathway.

RAD51 filament formation is mediated by the BRCA2 tumour suppressor, mutations in which lead to a high incidence of developing breast cancer. BRCA2 interacts with other HR factors, such as PALB2 and members of the RAD51 paralog family. Many of these proteins also function as tumour suppressors.

Cost effectiveness analysis will be conducted.\n\nResults will allow to understand factors affecting specific VE, the duration of protection of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, the interaction between vaccines, the role of repeated vaccinations, the occurrence of serotype replacement (pneumococcus); identify vaccine types and brands with low VE; guide the decision of  the WHO committees on  vaccine strain selection (influenza); provide robust benefit indicators (VE and VI) and cost benefit and effectiveness results; guide vaccination strategies (schedules, doses, boosters). This EU member state collaboration will respond to questions that require studies based on large sample sizes and sharing of expertise that cannot be achieved by one country alone. It will allow the best methods to be used and results to benefit to all EU countries whatever their current public health achievements.
