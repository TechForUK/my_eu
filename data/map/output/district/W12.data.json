However, this cell transplantation approach has given inconsistent results, with some patients doing extremely well and coming off anti-PD medication for years, whilst others have shown no or only modest clinical improvements, and in some cases also developed severe, off-state graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs). The reasons behind this heterogeneity of outcomes, and the emergence of GIDs in particular, need to be better understood, not least in the perspective of the rapid advances that are now being made in the development of stem-cell based therapies. There is therefore an urgent need to revisit the trials that have already been done with fetal VM tissue in PD patients, with the expectation that a critical reassessment can form the basis for an optimised and more standardised procedure that will translate into more consistently efficacious transplants with minimal side-effects. Over the last two years a group of international experts, including the key investigators of the previous European and North American trials, has been re-examining the outcome of these trials as well as reviewing the results obtained from recent and ongoing animal experimental studies, and identified a number of weaknesses that may explain the inconsistent outcome in previous trials. As a result of these discussions, the group has agreed to join forces in a new round of experimental work and cell therapy trials in PD, based on a new jointly developed protocol where all these factors are taken into account. In the first instance fetal VM tissue containing mesencephalic DA neuroblasts will be used, with the expectation that this will pave the way for bigger trials using dopaminergic neurons derived from stem cells.", 645448.0, 13189031.0, "TRANSEURO", "Honing protocols for Parkinson's stem cell therapy", "Current research is fine-tuning stem cell-based treatments to achieve consistent benefits for patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD).", "Motor symptoms of PD are caused by death of dopamine-generating cells in the area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. Currently there is no cure for PD but one of the most successful reparative treatments is the use of foetal dopaminergic (DA) cell-based treatments.\n\nAllo-transplantation of DA neuroblasts obtained from foetal stem cells from ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue has provided inconsistent results. Some patients do very well and others show only modest improvement of clinical symptoms. In some cases, however, the transplantee develops graft-induced dyskinesis (GID), abnormal involuntary movements.\n\nThe aim of the 'Neural transplantation in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease' (Transeuro) project is to develop a protocol for neural transplantation that would produce more consistent benefits for the patient and less damaging side-effects.\n\nTranseuro project results so far include a method of foetal tissue dissection and preparation that maximises DA cell survival within the transplant. Importantly, the ratio of DA to serotoninergic neuron is kept in favour of DA which minimises the risk of GID.\n\nTo aid information exchange and optimisation of future research, Transeuro set up a foetal tissue dissection database. Dissection parameters between groups can thus be compared which will help in the validation process.\n\nThe researchers have optimised the hibernation media  for tissue derived from VM cells prior to clinical use. All centres are now using tirilazad mesylate as a neuroprotective agent.\n\nStudies on GID have revealed that this side-effect only occurs in animals with pre-existing dyskinesis that is L-Dopa induced. The team also showed that prolonged storage of tissue only affects graft survival and not the development of GIDs.\n\nTranseuro has already started recruitment for the clinical programme where subjects are less than 65 years old and without L-Dopa\u2013induced dyskinesis or other significant cognitive deficits or medical illnesses. After 12 months of monitoring in an observational study, they are eligible for a neural graft.\n\nProject scientists have achieved success in the aims and objectives of the first part of the programme.

Molecular imaging can play a pivotal role in changing the landscape of drug design/development and improving the health care system.

By answering the questions above, PET imaging has the capacity to render much more effectively the transition from pre-clinical to clinical phase, and to strongly facilitate the development of better drugs at an earlier stage and in a much more sustainable manner.

The project starts from this idea and from the will to realize training experiences in Europe addressed to a target identified by the needs of the community we operate in. The experience will let the interested subject know a context different from their own, nearer to Europe, aware of the possibilities they have in their own territory and able to use the skills derived from their training. Also the staff of our cooperative will be trained both directly and indirectly (collaborating with our partners and developing the project). According to ISTAT data, by the end of 2016 are the young those who face more difficulties in finding a job. In fact in Italy the 39,4% of yhem are unemployed. Even if there are many national programs to increase the number of young workers (such as Garanzia Giovani or the programme of school-work alternance) more and more youngsters from 15 to 24 are unemployed. In Central and Southern Italy the situation is even worse, more than 60% of them are unemployed. This can be due to the personal situation of disadvantage experienced by many youngsters in our area which lead them to stop their training and educational path.\r\nWe have spent more than ten years working in the management services for people with dasibility, families and children and we propose a project which can enable those young people living in a situation of disadvantage to live a training experience abroad, after having been taught what they need as far as the foreign culture and language are concerned with the aim of giving them a chance of inclusion in the working world. Our objective is to contribuite, through a transnational mobility, to the reduction of the unemployment rate helping and supporting the disadvantaged young in their training process improving their knowledge and skills and streghtening the link between training and work placement. They will acquire a new way of thinking based on openmindedness and on a European perspective. The addressees of this project are young people from southern Italy who have finished their school path or vocational training. Those who are in a situation of social or economic disadvantage will have the priority. Our cooperative will devote special attention to people affected by disability who will be sided by qualified staff to fully live their formative experience. EU train is addressed to 133 young persons from southern Itay who will have the chance of living an empowering experience both in their private and professional life. Each of them will be trained in a sector which is in line with their ambitions and personal path. The destinations will be the UK, Spain and Malta.

New scientific evidence about the importance of early years comes from the fresh brain research (Shonkoff, 2001; Greenspan & Shanker, 2004, Mustard, 2010). The World Bank has recommended investment to early education in 2005 based on available evidence. The earlier projects of our team have produced some methodological recommendations. On this bases the following objectives are set for the project:\r\n1. To develop culturally relevant narrative play and learning environments in each country (classroom/school) as a result of new narrative pedagogy.\r\n2. To develop evaluation practices of narrative play and learning practices in classrooms (recording and evaluating play interactions, relation between co- and self-regulation, use of ICT \u2013 technology, and etc.).\r\n3. To develop NEPL guidelines for dissemination and further training of ECEC professionals in all participating countries.\r\nParticipants \r\n1.
