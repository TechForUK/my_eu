The researches of common aspects together with the valorisation of cultural differences are significant aspects of this project.  JR Circus moves on two parallel directions. On one side, it promotes the circus language as a means of development and active citizenship by enhancing the transnational mobility  of creative professionals and young artists through an extended stay where is fostered the artistic co-creation of a circus opera, based on one of the greatest masterpiece of all time, Romeo and Juliet, to be toured between different countries. JR stands for Juliet and Romeo and suggests meanwhile the word Junior, as the main actors involved are young artists between 16 and 22 years old coming from different EU countries. On the other side, it promotes the EU integration and intercultural dialogue through the issues it point out and the universal language of acrobatics that is used. At the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s birth, Romeo and Juliet is still a universal story. Romeo and Juliet are two acrobats that struggle between love and hate.

The goal is to introduce youth workers with new skills and knowledge which can be used as a tool in their further work with youngsters who are dealing with unemployment. Although target group are youth workers it will indirectly include young people influenced by the problems of unemployment, low standard of living, low income and other social and economic issues. \r\n\r\nThe applied activities will consist of non-formal learning methods, such as: creative workshops, field work, exchange of experiences, presentations, name games, ice-breakers, team building exercises, individual and group activities, discussions, debates, workshop on the Erasmus+ Program and workshops on project development.\r\n\r\nWe want to give our participants opportunity to get new skills and knowledge and to increase their ability to create projects which are tackling and solving the common community problems. With our project we will also support and stimulate mobility and mutual cooperation among European youth workers and stimulate youngster\u2019s awareness of active role in European society as well as in their local communities.

Some of the homes, which were  found were later burned down by the locals, refugees experienced hatred on social media and masses of people were persuaded to have a negative outlook on the issue.
