The services provided lead to a win-win-win situation for the economy, environment and community within the water-energy-food-employment nexus.\n\nHYDROUSA water loops will include water from non-conventional sources including wastewater, rainwater, seawater, groundwater and vapour water, all resulting in recovered and marketable products. HYDROUSA will demonstrate at large scale the feasibility and sustainability of innovative, low-cost water treatment technologies to recover freshwater, nutrients and energy from wastewater, salt and freshwater from seawater, and freshwater from atmospheric water vapour. Water conservation solutions including aquifer storage and sustainable agricultural practices including fertigation will be applied. The solutions will be demonstrated on 3 major touristic islands in Greece. Detailed technical and financial deployment plans will be established for replication in additional 25 locations worldwide. Through the on-site water loops of HYDROUSA, complex supply chains for resource recovery are not required, as producers are directly involved as consumers of derived products. HYDROUSA will combine traditional skilled workmanship with modern ICT integration in beautiful and smart automation systems. HYDROUSA will revolutionise water value chains in Mediterranean areas and beyond, from water abstraction to sewage treatment and reuse. The proposed HYDROUSA solutions show massive potential to change the way humans interact with water, food and energy.", 217110.0, 10460850.0, "HYDROUSA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214768_920720218"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5HJ", "Projekt zur F\u00f6rderung der Mobilit\u00e4t bei Auszubildenden der Robert Bosch GmbH\r\n2017", "Robert Bosch Ltd", 25676.0, "The aims of the Robert Bosch GmbH are based on the written and for all staffs generally valid so called \"We are Bosch\" that describes the values of our enterprise. Beneath many others, the value of \"cultural variety\" as well as the core competencies \"being globally present\" and \"personal development\" have main importance as a base of our daily actions.\r\nMoreover the Robert Bosch GmbH established a guideline that is binding  for every Bosch training department. This guideline\r\ndescribes that it is an essential target to  \"promote the mobility of our future skilled employees\" .To achieve this aim we offer our apprentices the opportunity of \"being send to one of our Bosch partner locations in Germany or abroad\" as well as we \"promote their knowledge of foreign languages\". Furthermore, blindness should be counteracted. The young employees should realize that the Robert Bosch GmbH consists of more than one plant. The exchange shows the variety of products and know-how is generated by get to know different manufacturing processes and techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother important  fact is the increase of attractiveness of starting a training at the Robert Bosch GmbH by having the opportunity to be delegated to a facility abroad and to learn a Iot about a foreign culture. Because of the demographic change there are less and\r\nless young people, who start a training in a company after having finished school. As a consequence for the companies there are less\r\nskilled employees. This Leads to a hard competition between the companies about getting the best of the school-leavers. Those young people often also make their decision for a company based on additional possibilities like a delegation.\r\n\r\nFour our apprentices there are also other important goals to achieve.\r\nFor them the delegation is a big challenge, especially because of the modified circumstances they have to face. Moreover for them it often is the first Ionger absence of their family and their home. Often named reasons for our apprentices are things like the\r\nunfamiliar food, maybe lower hygiene standards and the absence of family, partner and friends as well as the absence of hobbies and their sport clubs for example.\r\n\r\nOur apprentices stay about 2 to 8 weeks abroad depending on which country they are delegated to. We chose a relatively short time period for the delegation, because a Ionger time period would on the one hand mean that our apprentices would miss too many school lessons and on the other hand a Ionger time period would mean too many additional costs.\r\n\r\nWe choose our partner facilities for the Erasmus + project within the Bosch group. These facilities are in contact with our plant already for a long time. This simplifies the vocational adjustment, because the supervisors of our apprentices abroad already know the Bosch culture and the Bosch values. The apprentices have a locally contact person, whom they can address if they have questions or any problems to solve. Being on their own however, the search for identity and the self sufficiency of the apprentices is\r\nbeing promoted. Their language skills can also be improved by consistently communicating to their colleagues abroad. They are also attain intercultural competence, as they get a glimpse into a different culture with different values, attitudes, etc. and/or get knowledge about previously unknown ways of working. Furthermore the apprentices can improve their professional skills by getting\r\ndone the several tasks at the partner facilities and can appliance those professional skills after have returned to our plant.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing globalization it is essential to communicate the importance of flexibility and mobility at the workplace already at the apprenticeship.", "http://www.bosch.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003798_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "UB9"}
