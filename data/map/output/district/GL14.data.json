During this time, they work in departments that correspond to their apprenticeship and get to know the work at a plant abroad. On-site they join courses about culture, history and country specific backgrounds, make a factory tour and work together with their foreign colleagues.\r\nExperiences of the last years have shown that the apprentices gain more self-confidence and maturity. Furthermore they can put their English knowledge into practice, earn confidence and expand their vocabulary at once. The same time they get to know another part of the international structure of the company and it becomes easier for them to work together with foreign sites.\r\nIn the following two years, we would like to offer 30 apprentices an internship abroad. The professions are both technical and commercial.\r\nAfter the introduction in the beginning of the internship, they get introduced to their departments, where they join the coworkers in their daily work and run projects.\r\nEvery apprentice in the 2./3. training year is informed via letter about the possibility of an internship at a foreign site. Everyone who is interested may apply, precondition: Participation at the in-house, free of charge English-lessons.\r\nOrganizational issues (such as travel to and from, accommodation, communication with the sites, insurance and the contract) are supplied by the HR department of the company.", "http://www.leoni.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-002119_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GL14"}
