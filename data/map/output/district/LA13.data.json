The presence of foreign students is about 10% with over 10 different nationalities: this target represents a daily challenge for teachers who work to ensure their right to education, integration in the classroom and in the community group, imagining the school as a center of extra-curricular aggregation. To the high component of foreign students we have to add all children with learning difficulties, who in our school are about 80. In addition, the Institute presents the need to innovate the teaching / learning processes in order to reach an effective personalization, articulated not only on lectures, but on cooperative learning, problem-based learning, labs, cooperative learning and bilingualism in particular in the Language and Science departments. Finally, given the need to play a role as a cultural reference and socializing point, as well as educational, it is essential to restructure the school management in order to maintain a constant relationship with the students, with families and with the territory so that we can monitor the real needs of the community.\r\n\r\nWith IMAGINE we have therefore identified three areas for improvement:\r\n1. INCLUSION / EARLY SCHOOL LEAVING / EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS\r\n2. METHODOLOGY INNOVATION IN TEACHING STEM AND LANGUAGES\r\n3. MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nThe general objectives of the project are:\r\n- Improve the ability to structure the training offer to the needs of the least advantaged, with specific reference to the acquisition of skills in the inclusion field;\r\n- Modernize teaching methodologies through the development of EU-wide approach\r\n- promote improvements in the quality, innovation and internationalization\r\n- Improve the ability of participants to determine changes in terms of modernization and internationalization of the school.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n- Acquire operational tools and observe methodologies, to replicate in the class context, that will help in including the SEN pupils and in fighting early school leaving (eg. with the peer mediation), reinforcing the motivation to study and  ensuring the educational success through operational tools such as Mobile Technology and Music, reaching full inclusion of all students.\r\n- Incorporate into daily teaching new teaching methods of language and STEM such as learning-centered education, problem-based learning, cooperative learning, peer education, learning by doing and, for linguistic disciplines, the Bilengual Education.\r\n- Share and learn, observing and discussing with stakeholders, the best practices of the British educational system and other EU systems with particular reference to the aspects of quality management, development strategies and evaluation systems.\r\n\r\nThe project is structured into three general stages: preparation, implementation and evaluation / dissemination / follow up. The preparation phase will include the linguistic and intercultural preparation, on security procedures, as well as on logistics and content-related topics to be addressed during the mobility. The implementation phase involves 20 mobility flows to be organized during 16 months, of which 6 training courses and 14 Job Shadowing involving teachers, Headteacher and the General Accountant in partnership with schools and host training institutions.\r\n\r\nIMAGINE aims at achieving a significant impact in terms of learning outcomes, both in terms of skills acquired and new international, open-to-Europe attitudes and mindset, both at the individual and organisation levels.\r\n\r\nThe final and continous evaluation is a fundamental moment of our project, in order to understand whether and to what extent the objectives and expected results were achieved. The evaluation activities are planned, therefore, in different moments of the project:\r\n- At the end of each mobility\r\n- At the end of the project\r\nThese activities include the use of descriptive / qualitative indicators and quantitative indicators which allow to assess and describe whether the project has achieved the expected results in objectively measurable terms.", "http://www.furnessacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036098_2"], ["9BB", "E.IN.ST.E.I.N. - Efficient and INnovative management STrategies, English language Improvement and work-based learning: 3 milestoNes for school development", "FURNESS ACADEMIES TRUST", 35153.0, "The project \"E.IN.ST.E.I.N. - Efficient and innovative management STrategies, English language Improvement and work-based learning: three milestones for school development\" is proposed dall'IISS Calamatta of Civitavecchia, in partnership with Furness Academy (UK) and Winnova (Finland).\r\n\r\nThe proposal is based on the knowledge that it is now necessary to innovate management methods and school organization management, in particular by focusing on shared leadership as a virtuous model and, therefore, to train the school staff to apply this. In addition, the internationalization that is the basis of our strategic development plan can not do without an improvement of language skills and the adoption of CLIL method for the non linguistic subjects. Finally, EINSTEIN promoters  believe that in order for the Alternance School/Work and the work-based learning to really help to meet the challenges of employability in a labor market increasingly segmented and specialized, it is necessary to deal with other European educational institutions in order to learn good practices of work-based learning organization, in particular in relation to the Technical Nautical branch, which is one of the areas on which the territorial and national economy is based.\r\n\r\nFollowing the three considerations just described and the needs analysis, EINSTEIN aims at meeting 3 general objectives:\r\n1. Internationalizing the educational offer\r\n2. Make the school management more efficient, dynamic and innovative\r\n3. Improving work-based learning practices in order to reduce the mismatch of skills and really make it functional for employability, with particular reference to the Nautical branch\r\n\r\nThese macro objectives can then be focused on more specific goals that we aim to achieve through the proposed mobility plan. These specific objectives are:\r\n- Empowerment of English language skills for the school governance people (Headteacher and Accountancy General Director) and for non-linguistic subject teachers who want to start the CLIL method implementation. For these latter, starting a gradual adoption of CLIL in non-language teaching is an objective to reach, too;\r\n- Allowing the school managers and teachers with functional responsibility roles to experience new European models of governance, organization and management of educational institutions inspired by the shared leadership and a functional human resources management, with specific reference to the relationship between educational and management areas;\r\n- Convey knowledge, methods of analysis and action to leadership and management support tools (planning, design, evaluation), enhancing the planning and problem solving, to promote and to flexibly manage change and pursuing efficiently and effectively the objectives which the school structure is stressed, appealing appearance motivation of the human resources\r\n- Restructure the organizational system of the work based learning in the Nautical branch, enabling the participating teachers to get competences that will help them to build an alternance school/work that can give the students the key elements to successfully entering the labour market, directing them towards the most requested skills from companies.\r\n\r\nTo meet to the identified needs and achieve the objectives described above, EINSTEIN is structured into 3 general stages:\r\n1. preparation, considered as preparation of the project but also as a preparation of each participant to the mobility experience\r\n2. implementation, including two types of mobility:\r\n- N. 10 training courses aimed at the empowerment of the English language and the CLIL methodology for non linguistic teachers, Headteacher and Accountancy General Director;\r\n- N. 7 job shadowing, which will lasts one week, 5 of which are aimed at the acquisition of management skills and management of human resources at the Furness Academy in the UK, while 2 of them will be focused on the observation of good practices of work based learning and alternance school/work in the Nautical branch. This job shadowing is aimed at allowing to compare and acquire of operative tools to make the alternance school/work as most effective as possible, related to employability.\r\n3. assessment / certification of skills / dissemination and follow up\r\n\r\nUpon completion of training, participants will have acquired new knowledge and skills to stimulate progresses in the modernization and innovation of the organization as a whole, making the most of individual strengths. Given the involvement of the top management of the Institute and of the teachers who will be then assigned management responsibility government functions within the school functional organization, we believe that EINSTEIN will help create a more modern, dynamic, committed and professional learning environment, thanks to the integration of best practices and new methods in daily activities and the opening of synergies with the training institutions and partner schools, which hopefully will lead to future projects.", "http://www.furnessacademy.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT02-KA101-036139_1"], ["9BB", "F.L.A.S.H. + - Foreign Languages and methodological innovation as an Asset for ScHool development", "FURNESS ACADEMIES TRUST", 35649.0, "The FLASH + Foreign Languages and methodological innovation as an Asset for ScHool development project has been designed to meet the following needs:\r\n1. A poor linguistic competence (English and French) of teachers who have expressed their intention to work within the operational group for the development of the European dimension and EU projects;\r\n2. Difficulty to adapt to the teaching systems of the partner schools emerged during the development of the various Erasmus projects in which our school has been involved. These difficulties concerned the different methods of teaching, relationship with the pupils, time and class management, of reconciliation of life and work times. We consider it essential, in order to improve our international dimension, to establish relationships with cutting-edge schools such as the two partner schools, in countries where the two main vehicular languages are spoken - and on which we focused the first linguistic empowerment action - from which we can learn a lot both in terms of managing international projects and in relation to the didactic approaches adopted.\r\n\r\nThis needs analysis has resulted in the preparation of FLASH +, which therefore aims to achieve the following general objectives:\r\n\r\n- to promote quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalization, in particular through enhanced and deepened transnational cooperation with our European partners, which allows us to understand methodologies and approaches, overcoming the difficulties encountered thanks to the comparison on the field;\r\n- improve the capacity of the teachers participating in the mobility project and part of the \"Erasmus +\" working group to determine changes in terms of modernization and international openness of our school;\r\n\r\nand to achieve the following specific objectives:\r\n- improve the linguistic competence and intercultural awareness of a specific target group of teachers interested in deepening European cooperation;\r\n- improve the understanding of the functioning of the school system in the partner schools, so as to reduce the remaining rigidities in the teaching approach and overcome the difficulties of cooperation found in the previous international projects of the Institute\r\n- learn new teaching methods and classroom management, innovative teaching practices that lead to greater integration of European good practice in daily teaching, with particular focus on new teaching methods devoted to personalization / individualization, cooperative learning, learning based on real problems, peer education and other educational innovations to be integrated into curricular programs\r\n- improve the skills of the teachers directly involved in the Erasmus + Working Group in relation to the quality of the preparation, implementation, monitoring and follow-up of EU projects\r\n- reach a substantial sharing by the teaching body of the Institute that allows the adoption of a bottom-top approach.\r\n\r\nThe project involves 13 units of teaching staff in 19 mobility, including 11 job shadowing and 8 training courses.

The project aims impact on science learning in schools re-defining it\u2019s to appeal to the young generations.Synthesizing leading research, it is clear that most girls do not feel comfortable with science education and the values and personal identities linked to science and science jobs. The problem is not a lack of intellectual capacity; the problem is at identity level.The teenage years are precisely the most important time in life for creating identity and personality, including gender identity, and this is why resistance to science among most school girls might in fact lasts a lifetime: when resistance towards certain school interests is directly linked to the creation of one\u2019s identity and personality, the resistance is very difficult to overcome in later in life.This is why ScienceGirls addresses teenage girls from 13 to 15 years old and their relations to science learning.The project will engage the girls in 3 major challenges:HOW WE FEEL SCIENCE- create a more authentic understanding of science and gender in early schooling through engaging teenage girls as co-creators of this understanding, through telling the personal and collective and gender-sensitive stories about science education and about the image of science in societySCIENCE IN REAL-LIFE- engage the girls and their support teachers in real-life/time science and research experience in collaboration with the local community, including interacting with female role-models in science and researchVISIONS OF EARLY SCIENCE ENGAGEMENT- invite the girls to co-create scenarios of new ways of science learning in school that will appear attractive and relevant to teenage girls and their emerging gender identitiesTheir teachers will learn about gender-sensitive science learning alongside the teams, and support the participation of the girls\u2019, but will not hold a privileged position in the project, as a united research community clearly states that \u201cscience teachers are a part of the problem\u201d, very often practicing forms of science teaching that disfavors girls and confirms many girls\u2019 \u201cprejudices\u201d against science and science jobs.The project will focus on and work through 5 overall innovative thematics, based on comprehensive preparatory reviews of recent science learning research:CO-CREATIONIDENTITYREAL-LIFE EXPERIENCE \u2013 OPEN SCHOOLINGMIXED REALITY COLLABORATIONAUTHENTIC VISIONS FOR ATTRACTIVE GENDER-SENSITIVE SCIENCE ENGAGEMENTThe 5 overall innovative thematics are detailed across the application and in the Attachment Pack.The project consortium is organized accordingly: 6 secondary schools as practice partners + 1 secondary school engaged through the Spanish knowledge partner, 2 academic institutions as knowledge partners and a quality assurance partner with 15 years of EU experience.Leading gender-sensitive science researcher Professor Louise Archer from the King\u2019s College in London has signed an agreement to collaborate with the project.A strong and most dynamic climax in the project will be the 5 days SCIENCEGIRLS SCIENCE VISION ENCOUNTER mobility, along which the participating girls will create visions for what science learning in school could be \u2013 with a strong focus on female identity.Key outcomes:THE SCIENCEGIRLS GUIDANCE TO GENDER-SENSITIVE SCIENCE LEARNING INNOVATION IN SECONDARY SCHOOLTHE SCIENCEGIRLS 30 MINUTES VIDEOSCENARIOS OF INNOVATIVE SCIENCE LEARNING IN SECONDARY SCHOOL \u2013 produced by the girls- teamsPolicy paper: INNOVATION IN SCIENCE LEARNING IN SCHOOLS IS IMMINENT \u2013 BUT WHO WILL DRIVE?Knowledge paper: CO-CREATION AND THE SCIENCE LEARNING INNOVATION AGENDA", "http://www.furnessacademy.co.uk", "FURNESS ACADEMIES TRUST", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024248_coordinator"], ["9BB", "Early Innovation Capacity\r\n\r\nFostering innovation interest and building innovation capacity among secondary school students through opening up new learning spaces for young learners", "FURNESS ACADEMIES TRUST", 221901.0, "ICAP IS A RESUBMISSION, IT RECEIVED A SCORE OF 80 AND A VERY POSITIVE EVALUATION, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE: \u201cTHE APPLICANTS ARE TO BE COMMENDED - NOT ONLY FOR THEIR INNOVATIVE IDEAS BUT ALSO FOR THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE APPLICATION.

ELIOT is based on the need, shared by all the partners, to innovate teaching/learning methods in order to improve basic skills of literacy and reading and minimize early drop out through the systematic integration of the techniques of Drama in Education (DiE) and the Forum Theatre in the educational curriculum. In the most updated joint report of EC and Council (26.08.2015) on the state of implementation of ET2020, it appears that in EU28 the 20% of 15 year old students still record very low scores in reading and literacy skills (much higher percentage in the students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds) and still more than 5 million early school leavers that are related to systemic unemployment (41% of those missing is unemployed, EC data) have been registered. On the assumption that low levels of basic skills hinder economic progress and limit individuals in professional personal and social achievement, partners have considered that, in order to increase employability and active citizenship, improved literacy skills should be conjugated with acquisition of key competences (creativity, initiative, language skills, critical thinking, dialogue and ability to work in teams, also multicultural) by all pupils, including those coming from a disadvantaged background).These learning objectives can be efficiently achieved thanks to the theatrical techniques of active and experiential learning. The sharing of this strategy is based on a common and deep needs analysis, carried out by all partners in the planning phase of the application, which shows that in all partner schools there is a need to establish an effective and efficient approach to motivate pupils to learn and attend by challenging the same educational choices of teachers.E.L.I.O.T. meets the following E+ priorities:- Supporting schools to face effectively the challenge of early school leaving- Coping with unsatisfactory results in the basic skills of literacy through innovative and effective teaching methods- Implementing an inclusive education, sharing good practices to reduce the learning disparities in pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.The general objectives are:- Developing literacy basic skills and key competences (i.e. multilingualism, learning to learn, social and civic competences, cultural awareness and expression) in pupils, using innovative and multidisciplinary pedagogical approaches- Fighting drop out and reducing disparities in learning outcomes that affect learners from disadvantaged backgrounds and with fewer opportunities- Strengthening the professional profile of teachers, helping them to adopt new methods and toolsThe specific objectives are:- Supporting the effectiveness of learning and motivation to attend lessons through the identification, involvement and experience of Drama in Education- Developing interdisciplinary teaching units that use the DiE as an innovative and experiential methodology- Developing teachers' skills, investing in joint training and exchange of good methodological innovation practicesE.L.I.O.T. directly involves 20 students (target ages 14/15 years old) and 3 teachers per partner. The latter will be protagonists of a joint staff training, leaded and organized by the British partner, on using the Drama in Education method in teaching; later on, they will develop 7 learning units with the integration of Drama in Education method in 7 different curricular disciplines, about topics included in the ordinary curriculum. These will be our main outputs produced, made available as OER with open license on the several dissemination channels included in the dissemination plan; they will be applied in local venues during open classes, and applied to the international class during the first two blended mobilities (3 students and 2 teachers per partner), held in Holland and Greece.
