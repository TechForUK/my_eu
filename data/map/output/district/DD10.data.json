This vocational training period has to be completed in order to pass the European standard BTECH diploma in Cookery and Catering, and provides the students with a mobility opportunity abroad, an opening into European Multicultural Citizenship and development of their vocational and linguistic skills. These students, who are registered in the second year of the three year European B Tech, in the Cookery, Service and Restaurant modules have already undertaken a first year Vocational BTECH. They comprise 2 classes of 24 students.  The first group will go to work placements in Europe in September 2014, the second group will have their training period in March - April 2015, The next class, of 48 students, will be divided in half so 24 will be sent in September - October 2015 and the others 24 in March - April 2016. In total 96 students, both boys and girls will benefit from these mobilities. The pupils are often quite young and some have challenging social backgrounds. The financial support from Erasmus+ contributes to a good quality, well-structured training opportunity.Since 2004, we have been building a network of receiving hotels in Ireland, Scotland and Estonia and have worked hard to establish these contacts. These European countries were chosen for ease of access from France, The receiving partners are all high quality hotels and restaurants.The aim of our students is to pass their Vocational B TECH and to obtain the Europass certificate. After being prepared for the mobility, the students, travelling in pairs, are supervised and monitored by our local partners. The receiving hotels or resturaants keep in touch with the tutor in charge of the project. Teachers from the Lyc\u00e9e visit to assess the trainee. The budget is established taking into account Erasmus funding, the contribution of partner companies, the Lyc\u00e9e, family and a financial grant from the Region Ile de France. The activities and results of the project are widely disseminated in newspapers, and websites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 2: Consists of a 5 month European mobility which is suitable for students who have just passed a diploma in the Cookery and Catering sector and having now a CAP, a Vocational B TECH or a Technology BTECH. They are enrolled in a complementary local initiative training - FCIL: Adaptability to Cooking and Catering Trade in Europe and Abroad (Adaptation aux M\u00e9tiers de l'H\u00f4tellerie en Europe et \u00e0 l'International).Our participants are mainly from the Paris area and they come from modest social backgrounds. They require financial and an organisational help. Our aims are to prepare our students to adapt to diverse cultural and vocational situations to enrich their lives. This project aims to further their vocational and social integration into the world of work and to familiarize them with applying a Lifelong Learning training. At our Lyc\u00e9e, our involvement in European programmes is part of the \"European and International Opening\" axis of our school project. This international dimension is likely to enhance our desirability in terms of recruitment and employability, contributing to the excellent reputation of our training and enhance the positive image of our school. Our project is supported by the strong C.H.A.S.E Network (Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools Schools of Europe) which is now of 24 years standing and has 14 partner catering schools or institutions located in 13 European countries: Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland , Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey. It is thanks to this network that the mobility projects can be realised; the wide range of European destinations has a strong attraction for students wanting to participate. In order to coordinate our activities, improve communication and to make long-lasting partnerships, a annual meeting is organized where we decide on a joint focus for the project e,g, this year we chose: Awareness of Health and Nutrition in the Cookery and Catering sector in Europe, The mobilities last for five months. During the first 4 weeks there is a period of cultural and linguistic training to prepare the students for their internships in hotels or restaurants. During the four months internship students are accommodated in the hotel or in nearby hostels or apartments. Students have a nominated supervisor in the hotel or restaurant placements and are also monitored by a tutor from the receiving partner and from the Lyc\u00e9e, the sending organisation. To be able to finance this invaluable learning project we depend on the contribution from Europe - the share of the ERASMUS + grant being only 28.4% of the total budget.

This team demonstrates and encourages the use of solar cookers and other appropriate technologies; oversees the harvest, processing and preservation of local plants to produce jams, pickles, creams, soaps, toothpaste, herbal teas, etc. Organic Growing focuses on organic food production, including composting and irrigation, in Sunseed\u2019s garden terraces, promoting practical self-sufficiency. This offers an educational hands-on experience of food growing using organic garden techniques. Drylands Management aims to halt the process of desertification, to replenish the soil by managing and harvesting scarce water resources and implementing planting programmes of indigenous plants, shrubs and tree species. We seek to understand the process of soil degradation through observation of natural ecosystems, and to use this knowledge as the foundation for advising on and applying appropriate practices.Appropriate Technology promotes innovation in the use of available technologies to reduce our impact on the environment. Volunteers in this department help to maintain the solar power and water pumping systems, and promote projects in areas such as biogas, solar energy and also water, wind and pedal-powered energy generating machines. Eco-construction and Maintenance is responsible for the upkeep of the project site and our buildings. A mix of traditional and local ecological building methods and materials are used, such as ca\u00f1a, a type of bamboo growing locally in parts of south Spain.  Communication and Education co-ordinates the website, information and educational aspects of Sunseed\u2019s aims across all departments. Volunteers help to produce and to distribute information, research and literature produced by Sunseed, help with translations, open days, courses and developing partnerships and networks and contribute to the website in particular the volunteer stories.Our philosophy is learning by doing and personal responsibility for yourself, other people and the environment. This is a source of knowledge for many people, especially young people, who after spending sometime in Sunseed, realise that they themselves are agents of change in our society. The various tasks and daily work that we do, from working in the garden to cooking for a group, to public speaking, to developing a project with the help of a coordinator, are factors that motivate and empower the volunteers. Furthermore, thanks to the fact that all the activities take place communally with people from different backgrounds and origins, the volunteers have the opportunity to discover and experience the beauty and benefits of team work, internationalism, cultural tolerance as well as youth social participation.We share the spirit and the values of EVS: we are committed to informal learning through action and cooperation, social resposibility, as well as the importance of promoting solidarity and tolerance, the development of international solidarity and respect for current and future generations. Thanks to community life, we promote the internalisation of these values through every day practice.", "http://www.article12.org", null, "erasmus_2016-2-ES02-KA105-008017_1"], ["9EZ", "Language Training", "Borrowfield Primary School", 5665.0, "1plus2 is a Government initiative which states by 2020 all children should be engaging with 2 additional languages.  This is essential to ensure the pupils in Scotland are provided with an education that will allow them to be equipped for jobs in the future. Language learning has vast benefits to our brains and can even prevent the onset of diseases such as dementia. The Scottish Government is forward thinking in understanding the need to introduce a norm for language learning in schools based on the European Union 1+2 model.  It is the job of teachers, like us, to ensure the Government policy is met and we provide the conditions in which every child is  learning two languages in addition to their own mother tongue.  In our local authority the first modern language the pupils will engage in is French.  To meet this target, the staff in schools need to develop their own French language skills.  Each school in our authority was given the opportunity to attend and Immersion course in France. Three teachers from Borrowfield have volunteered to attend an immersion course in France (giving up a week of their school holidays) to train and develop our ability to read, write, speak and understand the French language.  These three teachers are enthusiastic and have a basic understanding of the French language.  We can not only educate children in the spoken language, it is imperative that we also develop an understanding of French culture, something that can not be taught through the use of online resources or textbooks. Attending the LFEE immersion course will allow us to:\r\n\r\n- improve methodological expertise in teaching French\r\n- provide us with materials suitable for teaching French\r\n- develop cultural awareness, understanding of contemporary France and develop knowledge of the Education system in France\r\n- improve our own competency in French\r\n- understand how to use ICT resources\r\n\r\nWe will take part in daily lessons whilst on the immersion course and we will engage in cultural trips where we can practice using the French language with native speakers.  However, our overall aim is to embed the French language and culture in our school(s) with staff being confident in their own abilities.  In turn, we will then be able to meet the new 1plus2 Government initiative.\r\n\r\nOnce we have engaged with new resources and have a better understanding of the French culture, we will disseminate the learning to staff in Borrowfield and Natalie will share learning in all schools in Angus and with the Staff Tutors in PanTayside. This collaborative approach will ensure our new skills and knowledge will be cascaded to hundreds of teachers in authorities other than our own. One class teacher in Borrowfield has linked with a school in France and we all hope to support this teacher by sharing our learning of what school is like in France.  Natalie is in the process of linking other schools and again will share school culture with colleagues who are involved in using eTwinning. Pupils will also have the opportunity to communicate using ICT.  It is important our learning is shared not only in school but also in the wider community so parents, carers and the general public are aware of 1+2 and the need for learning languages. Therefore, we will share our learning with the wider community so everyone understands the importance of maintaining our European links.  By attending the immersion courses, we would also all hope to develop a network of colleagues who would be able to support each other on our learning journey. When in France, we will make links with other schools and businesses with whom we could use ICT to communicate with once we have returned to Scotland. We even hope to hold an Immersion CPD.  This would involve inviting all teachers in Angus (including Rebecca Crabb and Carole Lyons) to a training session where Natalie and others who have attended an Immersion Course, share what they learned i.e. cascading our knowledge and resources with all teachers in Angus.  The impact this LFEE Europe Immersion course could have on our professional learning and personal learning is vast.  However, this same impact will then be felt by teachers who attend our twilights this year and in the future. \r\n\r\nOverall, we hope to pass on our enthusiasm for learning other languages to the pupils in our class and school.  We would relish the opportunity to update our professional capabilities through attending the LFEE Europe Immersion Course.  However, we require the funding to do so.

It has an ever increasing roll with a growing number of children arriving with English as a Second Language or with no English at all. Our catchment area is very mixed including significant numbers of children from areas with social deprivation. We have classes from Primary 1 to 7 and are a two stream school with some stages being 3 stream. We also have morning and afternoon nursery for pre and ante-pre school aged children. Additionally we are a resourced school for children with special educational needs.\r\n\r\nThe two participants are both staff at Lochside Primary teaching at Second Level. One is teaching L2 French and the other L3 Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe staff have previously attended  the Full Immersion Course provided by LFEE in France  as part of a larger project to develop language teaching and global citizenship in the school. They would now like to attend the course in order to improve their language skills , subject knowledge and confidence to teach pupils and to help train their colleagues in L3 Spanish.  They would also like to get a deeper understanding of  culture and through the e-twinning project be able to promote the European dimension and internationalism to the school and community.\r\n\r\nHaving the participants attend the course will fulfil several needs of the school and cluster and impact on our pupils and their families as well as colleagues  in the school, cluster and local authority.    Firstly it will provide us with a core group of staff who have received quality training in a relevant context and feel confident and enthusiastic about teaching Spanish. The participants will plan and lead workshops for the whole staff  to share any strategies and resources gained on the course.  The plan is to continue to collect a bank of resources that will be available to the school staff and to cluster colleagues through the Language Co-ordinator forum.   Finally,  there is a need to develop digital literacy and ICT in all subjects of the curriculum.  \r\n\r\nAs the Scottish government's 1+2 Languages initiative is a major priority across the country, it will be addressed  in our school's planning as we approach the 2020 deadline. This is to ensure we meet the demands of the Scottish Government regarding the teaching and learning of modern languages.  The participants hope to be able to contribute to the implementation of this policy in our school, cluster and authority.

Now, nearly two years later, all classes from Nursery right up to P7 are engaging with learning language on a regular basis, with this increasing in depth and frequency as each term passes. The learning of L2 is in our school Improvement Plan and as a school we are committed to continue to strengthen the use of L2 within our day to day practice.  However at some staff Personal Professional reviews it was noted there was a  lack of confidence in the teaching of L2. As it is priority at both school and teacher level we held a meeting to discuss ways we could move forward. As a result, Senior Management Team with the help of the school Language Ambassador, carried out an audit asking staff to consider their skills set with regard to the teaching of languages. The results demonstrated that there was a very broad range of experience and varying levels of confidence amongst staff. Having had two members of staff complete an Immersion course previously and witnessing first hand the huge positive impact it had on their learning and teaching of L2 and L3 other staff felt it would be of benefit to their professional development in the teaching of languages. \r\n\r\nStaff selected for participation come from all stages of the school from nursery to P7, to Pupil Support staff, including Senior Management Team. There is a wide range of French ability within these staff members from those with formal qualifications to those learning for themselves  an elementary level There are also differences in the their cultural awareness of France, ranging from those who have visited France on holiday,  or school excursions, to those with no experience at all;  two members have never visited France before. There may be variation of language level and experience, however the members are united in their enthusiasm and commitment to improve their understanding of the French Language and Culture and imparting our knowledge onto the children of Bervie Primary School.\r\n\r\nThe staff  primarily hope to develop their own competence and confidence  in speaking, reading and understanding of the French language. This upskilling will enable them to embed languages more confidently in their daily classroom practice on a wider scale. During the course, participants hope to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the methodology used in the teaching of French to our young learners, gain new skills and techniques for teaching modern languages in a primary school and learn how to most effectively embed it, not only in the classroom but throughout the school.  This will further develop the 1+2 experience for all young learners within our school. They believe a week long immersion course in France (rather than one based in the UK) will help develop their cultural awareness of France and provide them with the authentic and invaluable teaching and learning experience , in a genuine French setting. They will cascade these experiences  throughout the school. \r\n\r\nOn return from France, the staff intend to share any resources, teaching methods and cultural awareness gained, throughout the school, parents and local community, the cluster and beyond to any other interested parties through twilights, 1+2 inservice days, working with the Language Development Officer to promote language learning, and through use of technology such as twitter and GLOW. \r\nWe believe as a school due to the high number of participants this year, after the course, there will be a greater opportunity  to be able to undertake proposed, including, twinning with a French school, forging links to cultural agencies in the local community and the wider North East of Scotland and re holding International events previously ran by our ML Specialist. \r\n\r\nBy attending the course, we foresee building a concrete link to firstly France and then hopefully wider Europe, to support the implementation of the 1+2 policy within school.

It's with the hope that this will further assist the school to follow the ever changing, new, National Curriculum and follow the National Policy of 1+2 in order to give all young people the access to 2 or more Modern Foreign Languages.  Pupils should also have a better insight into using ICT in order to communicate with pupils in the UK and abroad, practicing their communicative and linguistic skills in a more technologically advanced setting. \r\n\r\nAfter the course I should feel better equipped with fresh materials and ideas suitable for the teaching of Spanish at early secondary level, including new games and songs and reinforcement of my methodological expertise in languages, focusing on all aspects of cross curricular learning.

The main goal is to increase the employment opportunities for our students in the cookery and catering industry. This project concerns students preparing the equivalent of the BTECH in cooking and service and young graduates from less than a year.\r\nActivity 1:Students preparing their BTECH with a European option (40 students per level displayed in 7 classes) can improve their professional skills as well as their linguistic cultural and personnal skills thanks to an 8 week training period in one of our european hotel partners.

Two mobility sessions are planned a year (september 2018, mars 2019, september 2019, march 2020).To ensure fairness among the students (chefs and waiters) and to meet our partners expectations, the selection of trainees is well balanced. The short term goals are to pass their BTECH with the European distinction thanks to the points given by the optional Mobility and european sp\u00e9cific exams, to obtain a Europass, and the cambridge certificate.\r\nOur activities are in 4 parts: \r\na) a linguistic  part with English lessons and DNL.\r\nb) a cultural part with european citizenship awareness and introduction to the cultural specificities of our european partners.\r\nc) a professionnal part to improve our students' skills in the catering industry.\r\nd) a personnal part to developpe autonomy, adaptability of the students and their skills in new technologies.\r\nThe students are welcome by our partners or providers collaborating with the coordinators. A weekly monitoring helps  to guide the students. 2 teachers assess the students in the host country, they ensure the continuation of the partnerships, they anticipate the next work placements and look for new hotel restaurants.\r\nThe European financing as well as the grants from the region, the school, the partners and the families guaranty the same opportunities for all students.
