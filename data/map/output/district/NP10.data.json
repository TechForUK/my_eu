The starting premise of the project is that Europe\u2019s knowledge resources and its role in the global economy will be increasingly shaped by the ability of EU firms to source knowledge internationally. Firms can employ three modes in internationalizing their innovative activities: (a) the global trading of technology based services and licensing as firms seek to exploit the global markets for their technologies; (b) international collaborative agreements and strategic alliances as firms seek out international partners for their knowledge generating activities; and (c) the international dispersal of their own R&D and technology creating activities as they seek out new regions and resources in different parts of the world. The GlobInn project aims to bring together leading EU scholars involved in studying each of these modes largely in isolation to focus on an integrated analysis. In the first instance this analysis will map the trends in the growth of each of these modes with an emphasis on whether internationalization of innovation in European firms is an intra EU or extra EU phenomenon. The second focal point will be the organisational and managerial issues which influence the strategies of EU firms in seeking international sources of knowledge, and have an impact on their on innovation and economic performance.

However despite the huge efforts in the last two decades saturation effects are observed in their performance. Efforts so far have been concentrated towards engineering and fine-tuning of the dyes, the electrolytes and the interface of the dye to the electron acceptor, employing titania as the electron acceptor.\nDSSCs rely, then, on dyes for efficient light harvesting which in turn entails high fabrication costs associated to the Ru-based dyes as well as the use of 10 um thick devices. In addition, optimized titania requires high-temperature processing raising concerns for its potential for low-cost, flexible-platform fabrication.\nIn this project we propose a disruptive approach; to replace titania with a novel electron accepting nanoporous semiconductor with a bandgap suitable for optimized solar harnessing and a very high absorption coefficient to allow total light absorption within 2 um across its absorption spectrum. In addition the deposition of the nanostructured platform will employ processing below 200oC, compatible with plastic, flexible substrates and cost-effective roll-to-roll manufacturing.\nWe will focus on non-toxic high-abundance nanomaterials in order to enable successful deployment of DSSCs with targeted efficiencies in excess of 15% and 10% for SS-DSSCs, thanks to efficient solar harnessing offered by the novel nanocrystal electron acceptor.\nTo tackle this multidisciplinary challenge we have assembled a group of experts in the respective fields: development of nanocrystal solar cells, DSSC technology and physics, atomic layer and surface characterisation and a technology leader (industrial partner) in the manufacturing and development of third generation, thin film, photovoltaic cells and modules (DSSCs).", 180322.0, 2816780.0, "NANOMATCELL", "Panchromatic solar energy conversion", "Dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) are among the latest solar cell concepts, mimicking nature's absorption of light in photosynthesis with a photoactive dye.

Using abundant and non-toxic nanomaterials, the semiconductor will have optimal band gap and a very high absorption coefficient to harness the maximum possible sunlight. It will simultaneously enhance efficiency while increasing compatibility with flexible plastic substrates and the use of cost-effective roll-to-roll processing.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, the team developed novel strategies for synthesis, growth and doping of semiconductor nanocrystals and nanowires. These included a new pathway to environmentally friendly colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals with tuned band gaps and very high absorption coefficients.\n\nThe dye plays a central role in the function of DSSCs so the work would not be complete without development of new dyes that take advantage of a larger portion of the spectrum. Researchers have created dyes for short wavelengths and for enhanced absorption in the near-infrared range.\n\nOnce the light or incident photon is absorbed, it creates an exciton or electron-hole pair.

The team has made important progress with development of new and improved solid-state hole transport layers and enhanced understanding of carrier physics of inorganic-hybrid materials.\n\nResearchers have already produced a range of solar cells based on panchromatic inorganic and hybrid absorbers with promising performance supporting the potential to reach project goals with further optimisation.
