However there is a lack of progress in the education arena. Hence, recent studies show that high percentages of college graduates can't find work, the dropout rate is high and new generations are moving back into their parents homes after school or college. Nevertheless, the digital trend indicates that today's grade-school children will end up at jobs that haven't been invented yet.\n\nNowadays, several studies assure that digital fabrication and making technologies, if coupled with proper learning methodologies such as Constructivism can provide learning experiences that promote young people\u2019s creativity, critical thinking, teamwork, and problem solving skills, which are essential and necessary in the workplace of the 21st century. However, as early as 2008 a OECD report remarked that \u201ctechnology is everywhere, except in schools\u201d. In addition to this, most uses of technologies in education and training today do not support  21st-century learning skills. In many cases, new technologies are simply reinforcing old ways of training and learning in current school settings and very often they are introduced according to a narrow perception as being suitable only for talented youth or only for Science-, Maths- or Engineering-oriented majors. Current developments call for a move from this elitism to the recognition that fluency with making technologies represents knowledge and skills valuable for\nevery citizen.\n\nThe eCraft2Learn project will research, design, pilot and validate an ecosystem based on digital fabrication and making technologies for creating computer-supported artefacts. The project aims at reinforcing personalised learning and teaching in science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) education and to assist the development of 21st century skills that promote inclusion and employability for youth in the EU. The eCraft2Learn ecosystem will support both formal and informal learning by providing the appropriate digital fabrication, making technologies, and programming tools. It will also incorporate mechanisms for personalised and adaptive learning.", 49179.0, 1698984.0, "eCraft2Learn", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_206165_919675916"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0PL", "Avantura Istra\u017eivanja Europe", "Chorley Healey Scout Group", 9002.0, "Project \u02ddAdventure Exploring Europe\u02dd is designed as a joint project of the \u02ddZelena patrola\u02dd Scout Troop from Croatia (ZP) and \u02ddChorley Healey\u02dd Scout Troop (CH) from England,within the Erasmus+ Programme,KA1, Learning Mobility of Individuals, Youth mobility.\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\nThe project represents a connection of ZP and CH through an idea and implementation of the common organization of ZP's trip to England and staying of both groups at a \u02ddRed Rose 2014\u02dd  Camp,which takes place in Westmorland,England.\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n-to increase the opportunities of  ZP's members to travel to England\r\n-to additionally inform members of ZP and CH on the possibilities and opportunities of cooperation and financing through EU programmes,especially through Erasmus+.\r\n-to increase mobility of ZP's young members  and encourage participation of youth members of CH in mobility projects\r\n-thus contributing to inclusion of young people in the projects provided by EU and to opening and stimulating a feeling of the availability of numerous possibilities to create different connections within the EU\r\nTOPICS\r\nYouth(Participation,Youth Work,Youth Policy)\r\nEnhance social inclusion,equal opportunities and participation in sports\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nMembers of ZP and CH' troops: \r\n4 girls and 12 boys ranging from 13-24 years,group leaders \r\n3 young people with fewer opportunities\r\nLEARNING OUTCOMES \r\nOverall project activities are designed to encourage creativity and active participation of all members and thus acquiring different competencies that could be useful for lifetime.

MIFA aims to equip students with the skills and experience to progress into education or employment within sport via a formal training programme which provides a full-time, unique and innovative learning experience for 16-19 year olds who have not quite made the grade at a professional club, or simply have a passion for football and want to pursue their dreams. OBJECTIVESThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of MIFA students. Working with host partner Browns in Portugal, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: 1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the MIFA programme and students.2) Exposing students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.3) Embedding lifelong learning principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThere are currently 40 students at MIFA of which approximately 55% are male, 45% are female and 38% are from Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups. Participants will be selected from the circa 90 students that will form part of the MIFA programme in the 2016/2017 academic year. PROJECT ACTIVITIESThe majority of the project activities will take place at the Browns facility, including:- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. - Games versus high quality Portugese youth teams.- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.Browns has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable MIFA to enhance the activities of participants. For example:- Access to top flight Portugese football teams, Portimonense SC and SC Olhanense.- A visit to the Algarve Football Association.- Observation of a live Portugese professional league fixture. METHODOLGYMIFA will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. IMPACTSThe impacts on participants are expected to include:- Achievement of recognised qualifications (e.g. BTEC L1 Work Skills). - Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.The impacts on MIFA are expected to include:- Enhancement of the MIFA programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. - Implementation of best practice across the MIFA programme.- Improved exit and progression opportunities for students, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.manchesterinternationalfootballacademy.com", "MIFA LTD", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023460_coordinator"], ["0PL", "Voda, element koji nas spaja!", "Chorley Healey Scout Group", 14125.0, "Project \u201eWater, element that connects us!\u201c represents international cooperation, exchange of experience, learning and friendship between 15 young people from Croatia, Zelena Patrola and 15 young people from England, Chorley Healy and  also will get a life useful skills and  knowledge to them. Zelena Patrola come from small, poor and rural place Jazavica, Raji\u0107. All residents of those area are exposed to economic and social difficulties and have prejudices about the possibilities and potential of international cooperation. It is also important for Chorley Helay group from Chorley place where citizens' mobilities are very rare and most of them do not have any international experience. Water is recognized as a nature resource that exists in great amount at both places. Young people, at the same time, are not aware enough about importance of drinking water and responsible use of the water and nature in general. Both groups of young people have recognized the need for a healthier,better and more active spending time in nature.The project objectives are: the acquisition of a number, for life important, competences of young people from both groups, through exchange of experiences, cooperation, friendship and learning; raising awareness of young project participants on the importance and impact of active spending time outdoors; exploring new cultures and customs, encouraging tolerance, breaking prejudice, respect for diversity and the adoption of healthy lifestyles of project participants in the context of drinking water and the adoption of responsible treatment of water when used in household and in nature.The project involves a total of 30 young people from Croatia and England. 15 of them from rural and peripheral areas and due to regional isolation they have fewer opportunities than other kids, few of them have social and economic difficulties, and the two of them have disability. Project will be conducted from 01. august 2016 till 28 february 2017, and the main activity ie. mobility in Croatia will be held from 11. August 2016 till 21 august 2016-e-s. During mobility, these activities will be implemented:Activities that encourage physical activity and sport out in nature while raising awareness about the importance of nature preservation, especially water (rafting,solar powered boating,riding school, water springhead cleaning, workshops in Lonjsko polje, competition in the pool, leisure activities ( water slide,thatched pool,fishing);Scouting activities and living in the camp where participants take part in the complete organization of the camp, from lifting tents,making beds,meals,washing the dishes etc.;Cultural and entertainment programs during the evenings that will present customs of the place from which the participants are, folklore, dance, song, performances;Educational presentation and workshop of participants, or other project stakeholders (Croatian Mountain Rescue Service,Croatian Waters dd) ;Art workshops and photo dayIn project activities, many volunteer representatives of local communities, associations and organizations will participate.In the implementation of activities numerous methods of unformal learning will be used, activities are carried out in a number of situations and in different environments and all participants of the project will improve their environmental knowledge, personal and recreational skills; entrepreneurial, organizational, interpersonal, intercultural and civic competences, skills for creative expression of ideas, curiosity and pioneering spirit, communication in native and English language competence of learning how to learn and digital skills .Upon completion of the project activities, numerous effects of the project on the young participants will be visible, through the acquisition of key competences, greater motivation to participate in international projects and a sense of the greater availability of the entire EU area as an area with great potential in the context of lifelong learning, greater self-confidence and empowerment of all participants, especially young people with difficulties, tolerance, respect for diversity and human rights, awareness of socially important topics, adopting healthy lifestyle habits through outdoor activities and water consumption and responsible behavior towards the environment. As a confirmation of acquired competences young people will get a Youthpass and certificate of participation.At the local level impacts of the project can be seen in the reduction of prejudices of the local community on international cooperation and such programs and the potential of small rural communities in this context, the greater the motivation for volunteering in such projects, but also awareness about volunteering in general. At all levels of the effects of the project can be seen in the recognition of non-formal and informal learning methods, encouraging solidarity, tolerance and European democratic values.", "http://www.chorleyhealeyscouts.btck.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-HR01-KA105-022302_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PR6"}
