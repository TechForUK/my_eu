The objectives are preparation for teaching children with severe and profound disabilities, promotion of innovative ideas and improvement of quality in teaching. Implementation of a new curriculum means changes in the skills and competences needed for teaching.  In order to be able to meet the needs of children with severe and profound disabilities we need to arrange retrainings and advanced trainings for our teachers. According to the school aims and priorities we have chosen the following mobilities:\r\n1. Job shadowing at Bluebell Park school (the UK), 19 days: three teachers in autumn 2014 and three teachers in spring 2015. Ahtme School has experience of cooperation with this partner in the frames of Comenius partnership project \"Outdoor education for SEN pupils\". This school is a great example for us and we can learn a lot from it. This is the reason why we are planning to send so many teachers there (6).\r\n2. The programme \"Outdoor leardership\" in Portugal, 1 person: the topic of outdoor education has been a priority in our school these years. We have organised several initiatives and projects and now we carry out lessons outdoors as a part of learning process. \r\nParticipation in the training programme in Portugal is necessary for bringing outdoor education in our school to a new level (leadership in environment awareness) and updating the knowledge. Only one teacher takes part in the training and he/she delivers the outcomes to others. \r\n3. The programme \"Every pupil is important  - special education in Finland and Europe\" in Finland, 1 person. The topics: teaching children with severe and profound disabilities in Finland, individual curricula, cooperation of specialists, outdoor education, vocational education. The topics of working with children with autism spectrum is also introduces. During the training the course participants visit the schools, learn and take part in round tables with Finnish teachers. \r\n4. \"Practical learning in a special needs school\", the Netherlands, 1 teacher and 1 teacher assistant. During one week they get to know the school training process, curricula, learn about the topics which are priority for us, analyse best practices, communicate with foreign partners on the topic of teaching children with severe and profound disabilities. \r\nThe project results are to be implemented in the school and shared with the teachers who could not participate in the project.

The over-arching themes of the programme are also drawn out in greater depth through our seminar programme. This allows a forum for the volunteers to contribute their unique experiences from the host projects into the programme as a whole, whilst also exploring broader themes around active citizenship and European identity.

We will collect and peer review good practices that use parks, nature and woods as green learning environments, and more specific for the target group of children between 8 and 14 years with mental and/or mixed impairments and/or learning disorders. Research suggests this target group takes even more advantage of the green environment for non-formal learning and basic and transversal skill development. The aims of the project are (1) to increase the awareness on the stimulants in nature to facilitate non-formal learning, (2) to collect and review existing practices for non-formal learning in Green Learning Environments with the target group, and (3) developing, testing and disseminating a toolbox.Our multinational, interdisciplinary project team comprises four green partners experienced in education in green areas, and six specialised schools for children with special needs, from Slovenia, the UK and Belgium. Through exchanging and peer reviewing existing practices within the participating organisations and other organisations within and beyond the project countries, we will build a database of and report on good practices for Green Learning Environments (Output O1). Based on this review, we will develop 12 educational materials, methods and tools to be included in the Green Learning Environments Toolbox (Output O2). Three country teams will develop the Toolbox, each team including a green partner and the specialised schools. The materials will be tested in one of the other schools involved in the project, and reviewed by the project team. The joint work on the Good Practices Database & Report and the Green Learning Environments Toolbox will lead to joint capacity building with the project partners. Finally, we will compile a Policy Brief (Output O3), stating the advantages of Green Learning Environments for children in general and our target group more specific. The Policy Brief will also include a brief summary of the project and will introduce the materials and outputs developed.The project will involve 125 children with special needs from 6 schools, and 175 staff members from these schools. We will communicate widely and give a lot of attention towards disseminating the results and tools provided by the project through social media, newsletters, articles in local and specialised press, conferences, mailing lists, ... (expected audience: at least 2000). The project will be closed by a Concluding Seminar, which will be held concurrently in the three countries involved (expected attendance: 55 national participants and 15 international participants each) (Multiplier Events E1, E2 & E3). To stimulate interaction between the 3 concurring seminars, we will set up video-conferencing; online streaming (and recording) the conferences makes it possible to expand the audience to people attending online during, or after the conferences. The Policy Brief will be sent out to relevant local, regional, national and European administrations, authorities, expert networks, umbrella organisations, politicians and policy-makers (over 125 addressees expected). In total we will reach over 2600 people.Apart from the results during the project, we aim at leaving a legacy trough the Green Learning Environments Toolbox, which will be widely promoted and will be freely available online, also after the end of the project, and trough the Policy Brief. We are assured that the project will lead to an increased awareness on the advantages of green areas for formal and non-formal learning. We are assured the Toolbox will stimulate schools and organisations to go outdoors for learning, leading to increased learning outcomes, and eventually to a better inclusion of the target group in society.", "http://www.bluebellparkknowsley.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE02-KA201-017373_7"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L32"}
