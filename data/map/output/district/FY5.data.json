Treatment of younger patients with severe hip disease using a conventional THR presents a challenge with the rate of success being very low, (most failing within 16 years). To over come this Finsbury help develop the MoM BHR resurfacing hip with a survival rate of 93% over a conventional THR. However, studies have reported high concentrations of Co &amp; Cr in the serum and/or urine of patients with MoM resurfacing implants. Studies have shown that increased levels of Co &amp; Cr cause caners such as leukaemia and are linked with myocardiopathy. During the course of this project we intend to overcome these problems by developing a ceramic one ceramic or ceramic on polymer resurfacing hip.

An orthopedic consultant may recommend a procedure called hip resurfacing, rather than a (THR) for more active patients whose bones are of good quality, allowing greater preservation of natural bone in and around the joint and providing greater durability. This involves replacing the damaged or diseased surface of the ball and socket joint in the hip with highly polished metallic capping, known as metal on metal (MoM) hip resurfacing.  However, reports of high blood and serum levels of cobalt and chromium in patients with MoM devices have raised important concerns about their long-term effects.\n\nEU-funded scientists set out to develop an improved hip prosthesis using high-performance ceramics with high compressive strength, wear resistance and chemical inertness. The project 'Enhanced durability resurfacing endoprosthesis' http://www.endure-fp7.com/ ((ENDURE)) set the ambitious goal of a prosthetic lifetime in excess of thirty years.\n\nIn order to arrive at the ceramic-on-polymer resurfacing hip prosthesis, researchers focused on alumina matrix composite bioceramics and carbon fibre-reinforced poly\u2013ether\u2013ether\u2013ketone. They developed new cost-effective polymer-processing methods and employed extensive theoretical and experimental testing to arrive at the final designs. The system and its implantation were successfully tested and demonstrated by specialised surgeons working on cadavers.\n\nPreliminary publication of results on the project website has led to a flurry of inquiries and expressed interest, providing the impetus for expediting the clinical trials process.

The project covered the entire supply chain from CNT functionalisation to aid their dispersion in polymeric matrices, to finished component design, manufacturing, testing and use.\n\nScientists developed technologies resulting in successful functionalisation of CNTs and improved dispersion. The functionalisation processes are scalable and resulted in a patent application. Composite laminates based on the thermoplastic polymers polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyphenylene sulphide were manufactured from the novel materials. These polymers are recyclable because unlike thermoset polymers, they can be reheated and reshaped into desired forms over and over. The team produced the laminates with both conventional manufacturing approaches as well as a novel impregnation technology for which a patent application was filed.\n\nThe team evaluated the mechanical properties and damage tolerance of these materials. Fracture toughness of the PEEK-CNT composites was improved compared to laminates without CNTs. Simulation results using models developed within the M-RECT project were in good correspondence with test results on validation components. The models will be valuable in guiding future development campaigns.\n\nMultifunctional honeycombs such as the curved, centre-symmetric SILICOMB structure are gaining interest for their enhanced structural integrity and light weight. Investigators also developed a variety of novel morphing honeycomb systems based on SILICOMB. These could offer important benefits in insulation and reduced fuel consumption, and development will continue in a follow-up project.\n\nIn addition to materials development, the team created a technology for damage assessment that can be moulded into a thermoplastic composite for structural health monitoring.

Scientists subjected them to thermal cycling tests over the range of 260 to 330 degrees Celsius, and also conducted random vibration tests. Microsection analysis following the test campaign allowed researchers to draw important conclusions regarding polymer degradation.

It presents opportunities for different levels of appreciation which in themselves can present opportunities for discussion and debate. It has  a significant rich history  and at times has defined and shaped history. It shapes the culture and context of many countries and groups. Many studies have demonstrated that music has a powerful impact on teaching and learning and can have a remarkable impact on the self esteem and self confidence of individuals and groups. As a student of music, learners have the opportunity to enrich their lives and even shape their futures.  We have much to learn from each other about how music can influence our cultures and the teaching and learning within our schools.\r\n\r\nObjectives - The project  will include two distinctive elements :- on one side the appreciation of music from different cultures and on the other side the performance and/or creation of music. Our objectives are:-\r\n-  to share experiences of the effective use of music in teaching and learning\r\n- to develop an understanding of the distinctive nature of music within each country and how it shapes the culture of each country\r\n- explore how music can enhance the learning and lives of all learners within our school community.\r\n\r\nParticipants - Five schools hope to participate in this project. Schools from England, Italy, Ireland, Poland and Turkey. The schools support the learning of children aged 5 to 18 who have a vast range of needs and competencies. Within each school there will be a project team made up of staff and pupils with a range of skills including international understanding, language skills, ICT skills and music skills and music appreciation. There will be in excess of 30 adults participating on a regular basis in the project with approximately 300 children working within the project on an intensive basis, and many more on a general level of participation.\r\n\r\nActivities - Throughout the project the partnership will focus on pedagogy and share best practice across all schools. This will lead to the production of study based literature and exemplar teaching and learning activities. The partners will be engaged in music based activities including music composition, collaborative performance and recording. This will result in the production of CDs, DVDs and web based resources.  The project will also engage in extensive communication through face to face school visits and regular web based communication. In addition during each mobility it is planned that the participants will engage in appropriate professional development activities including language development and  solution focused therapy.\r\n\r\nMethodology - The project will be delivered through a strategic approach. Baseline assessment of knowledge, skills and competencies will be secured and against this success criteria and expected outcomes will be generated.  This will  be shared with the entire partnership and the monitoring and evaluation of the progress will  be led by the Project Coordinator with regular review and moderation. Project development and moderation will also be reviewed through regular communication and through 5 planned school visit mobilities.\r\n\r\nResults, impact and  potential longer term outcomes. - At the end of the project it is expected that all partner schools will have enjoyed the partnership. This in turn will have an impact on the children and staff's enjoyment of school and should in turn have a very positive impact on learning outcomes. It is hoped that in the long term that this will lead to enthusiastic and resilient learners and less disengagement from the learning process by individual pupils.\r\n\r\nAll participants will have shared in the very best practice in the teaching of music and its contribution to the wider curriculum. This will have a positive impact on the desire for children to engage in learning and the enhancement of teaching and learning in all schools.
