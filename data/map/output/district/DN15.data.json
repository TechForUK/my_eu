This project is about planning a path, walking it and learning a lot while doing so.\r\n\r\n'Walk it!' is aimed at 48 youngsters between 15 and 18 years. The project is open for everyone, but the main focus is on disadvantaged youth.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives (and expectations) of this project are the practice and improvement of intercultural and language skills through intercultural learning, and the practice and improvement of social skills, leadership and cooperation through outdoor challenges and experiential learning. This will take place in an international and inclusive atmosphere, with a special focus on environmental awareness and the safety of the participants.\r\n\r\nWe use hiking and outdoor activities as integral parts of our experiential learning method to reach these objectives. Because for a lot of youngsters these activities will place them in situations in which they haven't been before, it will challenge them, present them opportunities to learn and grow and it will make them able to explore their own limits.\r\nParticipants will be able to co-plan their hike and than walk it. They will be able to take on responsibilities, will need to motivate and trust eachother while working together to get where they want. This physical process of walking will include a learningprocess in which they will be able to plan their individual learninggoals and keep track of what they learn, with support from the group and the group leaders.\r\n\r\nWalk it! might lead youngsters to have more trust in themselves and others, knowing they can reach the goals they want to, they can plan a path and follow it.
