Similar trends can be observed in the field of spoken-language interpreting where, alongside traditional onsite interpreting (i.e. where the interpreter and the speakers share the same space), remote interpreting is spreading through the use of telephone and videoconferencing. There is therefore a strong need for updating existing theoretical models of oral discourse and interpreter-mediated communication, and existing approaches to interpreter education. \r\n\r\nThis need becomes even more evident when considering the main pillars of the European Digital Agenda, which include enhancing digital literacy, digital skills and digital inclusion as well as generating benefits for society by drawing on ICTs to reduce energy consumption, support ageing citizens' lives, revolutionise health services and deliver better public services. Remote communication and remote interpreting respond to these pillars directly by reducing travel and fuel consumption; contributing to the inclusion of older people e.g. through remote healthcare; and making public services more efficient, e.g. through the use of remote interpreting services. The use of remote interpreting is also encouraged by Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings, which refers to the use of \u201ccommunication technology such as videoconferencing, telephone or the Internet\u201d (Art. 2) to optimise access to qualified interpreters. Remote communication and interpreting open up novel opportunities for gaining access to interpreters and for cross-border communication (including with interpreters). However, in order to develop a consistent approach across all stakeholders involved, the questions arising around remote communication and interpreting need to be addressed at transnational level.  \r\n\r\nAgainst this backdrop, the SHIFT project will create a European network - consisting of universities offering interpreting programmes and of interpreting service providers - whose goal is to develop a comprehensive pedagogical solution for training in remote interpreting at HE level and in Lifelong Learning.  This will be based on a) an in-depth study of orality in remote monolingual communication (English, Spanish, Italian) and remote, interpreter-mediated communication (for Italian<->Spanish, English<->Spanish, Italian<->English), and b) a market analysis to gain an in-depth understanding of the current and future demand for remote interpreting and the educational implications. Given that the demand for remote interpreting is growing especially in public service and business interpreting, where the main mode of interpreting is dialogue interpreting, the project will focus on the teaching of remote interpreting in dialogue situations . \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Develop a theoretical framework for the analysis of orality that focuses on discourse features which are especially relevant in remote communication and for language mediation and interpreting. Building on insights from linguistics and multimodality, a novel approach will be developed to investigate situated orality and describe how monolingual remote discourse unfolds. Particular emphasis will be placed on less studied but highly relevant oral phenomena such as register, speech markers, reported speech, pauses, interactional paralinguistic features (pausing and turn-taking patterns, backchannelling, hesitations, pitch and tone, changes in intonation, speed, pace, prosody, etc.), and related discoursive strategies typical of dialogic interactions; \r\n  \r\n2. Apply this framework to the description and analysis of remote interpreter-mediated interactions;\r\n\r\n3.  Carry out a needs/market analysis to elicit the most pressing knowledge gaps and educational needs in relation to remote interpreting; \r\n\r\n4. Develop a comprehensive pedagogical solution including a methodology and relevant pedagogical resources for remote interpreting, based on the specific features and challenges of remote discourse and remote interpreting and othe outcomes of the market analysis; \r\n\r\n5. Evaluate the pedagogical concept and resources with interpreter trainees and interpreting service provides in different fields of interpreting. \r\n\r\nThe SHIFT project will prove beneficial for trainee interpreters; academic and professional institutions involved in interpreter training; interpreting service providers and users in the public and private sectors. Interpreting students and practising interpreters will be enabled to increase their employability and digital literacy.

The platform will be centred in a Personal Health Record that will exploit recent advances on Health Avatars for the individual cancer patient surrounded by mHealth applications designed to encourage the patient, enhance clinician-patient communication, maximise compliance to therapy, inform about drug interactions, and contribute to the management of pain and other side-effects of cancer treatment. The Health Avatar PHR will regularly monitor the psycho-emotional status of the patient and will periodically record the everyday life experiences of the cancer patient with respect to the therapy side effects, while different groups of patients and their families will share information through diaries and clinicians are provided with clinical information. The PHR will help assess adherence to therapy, physiological and psychological status while the platform will recommend targeted informative applications and serious games according to the disease type and psycho-emotional status of the patients in order to promote a positive and healthier psycho-emotional state.

Yet it still remains a challenge to develop and deploy such solutions in a large scale due to the lack of an easy-to-use technology infrastructure and application exemplars. This problem arises from the nature of the SH field: multidisciplinary, diverse in its applications, and with multiple stakeholders. Whilst a one-size-fits-all technology infrastructure seems unlikely, alternatives are still missing. In addition, an effective approach to cross-discipline, cross-sector understanding for best practices has so far not been seen. \nACROSSING addresses this problem by implementing a multidisciplinary cross-sector pan-European training network to knock down barriers between disciplines and sectors and providing the ESRs with a broad training experience. ACROSSING develops 15 topically complementary research projects covering four core research themes, and four main application categories. By multidisciplinary collaborations and cross-sector interactions, the ESRs will develop flexible, interoperable underlying technologies which are then applied to and evaluated in multiple real application scenarios, leading to four specialised technology infrastructures and four best-practice application demonstrators. ACROSSING also deliver comprehensive blended training by combining campus-based and industrial practice training, and perspectives on personal development and social issues by well-established researchers and practitioners from academic, industry and user organisations. Whilst the scientific focus is to challenge the traditional way of SH research to develop advanced technologies and platforms, the training will train ESRs to establish links between research, real-world problems, innovation and personal career.

They are now being further marginalised by a new wave of speech technology that is increasingly woven into everyday life but which is not robust to atypical speech. TAPAS is proposing a programme of pathological speech research, that aims to transform the well-being of these people.\nThe TAPAS work programme targets three key research problems:\n(a) Detection: We will develop speech processing techniques for early detection of conditions that impact on speech production. The outcomes will be cheap and non-invasive diagnostic tools that provide early warning of the onset of progressive conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n(b) Therapy: We will use newly-emerging speech processing techniques to produce automated speech therapy tools. These tools will make therapy more accessible and more individually targeted. Better therapy can increase the chances of recovering intelligible speech after traumatic events such a stroke or oral surgery.  \n(c) Assisted Living: We will re-design current speech technology so that it works well for people with speech impairments and also helps in making informed clinical choices. People with speech impairments often have other co-occurring conditions making them reliant on carers. Speech-driven tools for assisted-living are a way to allow such people to live more independently.\nTAPAS adopts an inter-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approach.

SAMURAI has three significant novelties that make it distinctive from other recent and ongoing relevant activities both in the EU and elsewhere: *SAMURAI is to employ networked heterogeneous sensors rather than CCTV cameras alone so that multiple complementary sources of information can be fused to create a visualisation of a more complete \u2018big picture\u2019 of a crowded public space. *Existing systems focus on analysing recorded video using pre-defined hard rules, suffering from unacceptable false alarms. SAMURAI is to develop a real-time adaptive behaviour profiling and abnormality detection system for alarm event alert and prediction with much reduced false alarm.   *In addition to fix-positioned CCTV cameras, the SAMURAI system will also take command input from control room operators and mobile sensory input for patrolling security staff for a hybrid context-aware based abnormal behaviour recognition. This is in contrary to current video behaviour recognition system that relies purely on information extracted from the video data, often too ambiguous to be effective. SAMURAI has the following scientific objectives: 1. Develop innovative tools and systems for people, vehicle and luggage detection, tracking, type categorisation across a network of cameras under real world conditions. 2. Develop an abnormal behaviour detection system based on a heterogeneous sensor network consisting of both fix-positioned CCTV cameras and mobile wearable cameras with audio and positioning sensors.
