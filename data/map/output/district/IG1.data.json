Massive investments on the field and the latest advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensors has moved relevant market uptakes for autonomous driving from 2035 to 2020. \nCAVs are equipped with a huge number of sensors that allow them to understand the environment and act accordingly. However, this technology is superfluous without knowing the location of the vehicle in real time. Technology used to position a mobile device on earth is known as Global Navigation Satellite System \u2013 GNSS (e.g. GPS or GALILEO). Despite it seems impossible, currently, there are not any GNSS solution that meet the requirements of vehicle manufacturers for autonomous driving, due to: 1) excessive cost to be implemented at scale (low margin sector) 2) unavailability to provide location updates in real time under hostile GNSS conditions (e.g. urban canyons) and 3) lack of a reliability measure to detect when a location is not accurate enough. \nAt Albora, we have built and patented the Albora Correlation Engine, which uses AI and, in particular, biologically inspired Deep Learning Networks to achieve the performance required by the sector. Moreover, our technology can be embedded on the electronics currently available on autonomous vehicles, allowing us to keep the costs extremely low (no additional HW required!)\nTo exploit our product, we plan to build SW packages of our algorithms and sell licenses through an easy to use API (SW company approach). This model is highly scalable and will allow us to tackle the huge market opportunity. In fact, SW will keep the largest market share for CAV, growing from \u20ac0.5 billion at 2015 to \u20ac25 billion in 2030. To this end, we need to assess the technical risks of migrating our code to more efficient programing languages, seek industrial partners to perform large pilots and fine-tune our business model using design thinking techniques.", 43900.0, 62715.0, "ALBORA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_214025_910325407"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3LE", "If MORE is not enough, with good practice you will achieve THE MOST!", "Highlands Primary School", 13353.0, "Primary school Horvati school is 118 years old, with a long tradition in teaching and enthusiastic employees who, although working in inadequate are always willing to learn and change their approach to teaching. We believe it is very important to be the teacher with 21st century skills in order to teach 21st century students. Since the school has been well known for creating inclusive environment for students with special needs, we believe that the school staff needs lifelong training. By self-assessment we have identified areas where, as the school, we should achieve even greater improvements. The improvement of basic competences and skills, as well as the quality of teaching (regarding especially the basic skills of the weaker students of our school), is necessary for the successful educational process. We also think that we need to encourage higher quality and excellence in innovation and internationalization of the school in terms of education and training (particularly the use of ICT in the digital classroom, especially in the STEM field). One of our goals is certainly to improve the international dimension of education and training in our school. Therefore, we have identified areas in which the school should achieve improvement in order to achieve the target set by this project.THE SCHOOL NEEDS:  1.To ncrease the skills that would help to create an inclusive and fair surroundings 2. Promotion and development of international cooperation  3. Distance learning (E-LEARNING)It is the education of teachers that we consider extremely important and, even though our teachers have experience, we believe that it is crucial to observe the process of teaching and teachers in schools outside Croatia. Since we have been working in a very old school building, which is not architecturally appropriate for the students with special needs, the improvement of teachers' skills is crucial to build an inclusive and appropriate environment.For many years, we have been the leading elementary school in the use of videoconferencing in  classroom as learning methods. With the current results we want to upgrade our existing skills, progress and actively observe the implementation of  videoconferences organized by world-renowned experts in distance learning, going on at schools that have already been awarded for their achievements in the application of videoconferencing in the classroom.So far, most school teachers have practiced \" the enhanced e-learning\" (anywhere where the teacher has the access to at least one computer and a connection to the Internet, or at least some educational materials on the computer or other media).Therefore, we have identified the need for switching to the right side of the continuum, ie. the implementation of the hybrid classes (eg. all the text materials for chemistry are on the internet, students take part in creating online tasks, and only the experiments  take place in the school laboratory) and online ( theclasses that are completely online) learning.As the international cooperation could be realized through distance learning, we  consider that the second and the third point are closely related.The achievement of 2 and 3 are closely related to the realization of the first point of the Plan.Objectives:1. Improvement of key competences and skills, and of quality of the teaching (especially regarding students with lower basic skills, due to Institution's speciality in that field). Innovative and better way of working which would help us create inclusive surroundings even in inadequate conditions and which would enable more active social involvement of students in unfavorable conditions. 2. TImprovement of the international dimension of education and qualification in School. Strengthening conscience about the European project and the values of the European Union. Increased cooperation with partners from other countries and especially taking videoconferences as a method of teaching to the next level.3. Increase competences in using e-learning in class, especially the one in the middle and on the right side of the continuum.   In order to fulfill our goals 11 school employees will be involved in job shadowing in 8 partner institutions, 6 of which will return their visit.Our school will have a quality team of experts who are motivated to use newely gained skills in class to improve the education system and make classes better. E-learning, one of the imperatives of modern education which includes digital natives (students) and digital newcomers (teachers), will become an integral element of educational process of our school which will also involve teachers who have not been on professional specializations outside of country because they will feel motivated and strong enough to carry out activities of teaching on distance after the dissemination of the project on the school level.

Within the last three years the amount of hot spots have increased. Young people are growing up in regions affected by conflicts, enduring the consequences of extreme forms of physical and structural violence. They are often confronted with dramatic life forming experiences, emotions and challenges. Such experiences may strongly influence their views and behaviour towards their own and other communities. In the current situation with conflict escalations and crises in Europe there is an urgent need for providing the opportunity of communication between young people who are affected by the conflicts in order to prevent increased hatred and violence between and within the communities, to create the safe space where young people can meet and share their experience connected with the conflict, to better understand conflicts and start a process of conflict transformation\r\nThe youth exchange \u201cYouth for Peace\u201d is aimed at engaging young people and youth organizations from conflict stricken regions to the process of conflict transformation and dialogue within and between the communities through peace education and intercultural learning and to provide safe space for living and learning together. \r\nThe objectives of the youth exchange: \r\n- To share and to learn from each other as young people who are coming from conflict stricken communities; \r\n- To develop awareness and competences of participants in peace education, conflict transformation, intercultural learning and dialogue, including a critical understanding of personal and collective identities and their role in conflicts;\r\n- To share among participants their personal experiences of conflict and violence and their coping strategies in a positive and safe atmosphere of living and learning together;\r\n- To explore new ways of communication and dialogue through creative and innovative activities;\r\n- To learn about young people\u2019s realities in the participating countries;\r\n- To motivate and support participants in their role as multipliers and peer leaders in peace building in their local communities.\r\nThe youth exchange will involve young people 4 young people (18-26 years old) + 1 group leader from Armenia, Turkey, Georgia, Ukraine, Russia, Poland, UK and Lithuania. The profile of the participants: young people aged 18-26, from conflcit stricken communities, possibly those who have been displaced as a result of armed conflict (refugees, internally displaced people, migrants, asylum-seekers\u2026).\r\nThe youth exchange will take place on 5-15 June 2017 in Okhtyrka, Sumy region, Ukraine. Prior to the youth exchange Advanced Planning Visit for the group leaders from each partner will be conducted. \r\nThe working methods in the youth exchange will be based on the principles of non-formal and human rights education. The methodology will be based on the intercultural learning and learning from each other. The approaches, which will be used, will\r\nprovide a safe space for participants to have a positive experience of living together where sharing of personal experiences and points of view is possible. \r\nThroughout the youth exchange a human rights based approach is respected. Participants learn about the concepts of human rights and human dignity which forms the basis for a process of dialogue based on empathy and respect.  These values apply also to the way the youth exchange will be managed and the programme will be run; the camp should be an example of conflict transformation. \r\nAmong the methods which will be used are the following: getting-to-know each other activities, teambuilding and trust building activities, working in small groups, discussions in the community and mixed groups, dialogue sessions, simulation games, debates, research, self-reflections, meditations, community action, etc.\r\nWe expect that after the youth exchange the participants will gain self-confidence, self-esteem and assertiveness. Additionally to it, the participants will improve their self-awareness and critical thinking along with stronger communication skills. The participants will become more tolerant towards other people, especially towards those who have different opinions. They become more confident in confronting their own emotions and address sensitive issues. The participants will get inspired and motivated to act in their respective communities, which is the first step in conflict transformation leading to further commitment in the field of peace-building. \r\nThe organizations who are involved in the project will build new international partnership with organizations acting in the field of peace-building.

Many different cultures, languages and nations are living in peace. However, we are observing spread of extremism and xenophobia among youth nowadays. European societies embracing refugees and migrants, but there is also lack of knowledge of new cultures among host socieities. This phenomenon finds its reflexion in anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes, in racism and rise of populism .

Unfortunately, this trend seems to be getting even worse if we dont take action and take steps as active citizens.\r\nTaking into account all of the above, youthworkers and educators in Europe encounter  serious challenges. This Training Course aims to present and  provide tools and innovative methods of nonformal learning to combat with extremism and youth radicalisation.\r\nTherefore, the specific objectives of the proposed \"Youth Against  Extremism and Radicalization \" training course are as follows:\r\n- To furnish youth workers and leaders with tools and innovative methods to work with young people vulnerable to radicalization.\r\n- To analyze what are the main reasons and results  for the rise of Extremism and Radicalization in different European countries\r\n- To re-explore the key concepts, such as stereotypes, prejudices, discrimination, extremism, intolerance and their transformation in European reality\r\n- To provide space to youth workers to  exchange experience in promoting of intercultural and interreligious cooperation \r\n- To share the best practices and methods and to find new to address the problem of youth radicalization for develeping new projects for  local communities. \r\n- To explore the potential of international youth mobility as an opportunity for youth to promote European values.\r\n- To promote active citizenship, international dialogue, non-formal education  and  creative skills of participants.\r\n- To establish a network of organizations and individuals for  future cooperation to develop new projects promoting tolerance and multiculturalism\r\n- To create follow-up projects on promotion of tolerant attitude towards different cultures and religions among youth, especially among those with fewer opportunities.\r\nWe will use non-formal education methods and creative approach  in the course, and all activities will be focused exclusively on participants.
