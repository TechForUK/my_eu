It will take advantage of the excellent physical properties of diamond and gallium nitride heterostructures. The association of the two materials will give rise to the best materials and devices for ultimate performance in extreme environments. Both materials possess durability and robustness to high temperature, radiation and electric field. Diamond material exhibits the best mechanical robustness and thermal conductivity, while GaN presents also high electron mobility, giving high power handling and efficiency. III-N systems have other desirable properties for sensor applications in extreme environments.  It is the only highly polar semiconductor matrix that has ceramic-like stability and can form heterostructures.  It has the highest spontaneous polarisation with a Curie temperature above 1000\u00b0C for AlN: a lattice matched III-N heterostructure with a built-in polarisation discontinuity is expected to enable transistor action above 1000\u00b0C.   The packaging and metallisation of an electronic device or sensor are important elements in extreme conditions.  Metal contacts must be stable and the package must be thermally compatible with the device requirements and chemically stable.  MORGaN proposes a novel technological solution to electron device and sensor modules. Advanced 3D ceramic packaging and new metallisation techniques based on the emerging technology of MN\\1AXN alloys will also be explored. As such, the vision of MORGaN for materials for extreme conditions is holistic, involving 2 large industrial partners, 2 industrial labs, 6 SMEs and 13 public research partners. The project includes research, demonstration, management, training and dissemination activities.", 151375.0, 12107250.0, "MORGAN", "All-weather electronics", "New materials are being developed to create electronic devices and sensors that can withstand exposure to extreme conditions.", "Electronic devices and sensors often need to be used in high temperatures, high electric fields or in highly corrosive environments. Researchers from the 'Materials for robust gallium nitride' (Morgan) project are therefore investigating how diamond and gallium nitride (GaN) heterostructures can be used to produce the best materials for such conditions.\n\nDevices and sensors designed to operate in harsh environments need new semiconductor materials which are stable, especially at high temperatures, and which have substrate and package combinations that enable rapid heat extraction or the capability to withstand high temperatures. Chemical inertness is also an advantage, especially if there is a need to monitor highly corrosive chemical agents.\n\nScientists in France believe that diamond and gallium nitride heterostructures fulfil these criteria: both materials 'possess durability and robustness to high temperature, radiation and electric fields'. They explain that 'diamond material exhibits the best mechanical robustness and thermal conductivity, while GaN presents high electron mobility, giving high power handling and efficiency'.\n\nIn addition, the packaging and metallisation of electronic devices or sensors are essential considerations in extreme conditions and environments, as the researchers highlight.

The high production costs and problems related to obtaining reliable components explain that the utilization of piezo actuators up to now is far from having reached its full potential. Noliac and its partners for the IP are proposing a radical innovation in the piezoelectricity field, based on an enhanced understanding of materials degradation. This will greatly improve the properties of long actuators, and thereby allow end-users to use them for new industrial applications. The actuators shall be able to sustain extreme conditions, including high temperature, humid environment, and high pressure and will provide extreme long-term reliability.  The activities are divided in 4 work areas: \u2022 Research in materials degradation and the development of ceramics, which offer better resistance to crack initiation and propagation and are less sensitive to extreme conditions (WP2-WP4). \u2022 Two parallel approaches are followed to improve the interdigitated electrode technology for deposition ultra-narrow electrode paths in the laminated piezo materials (WP5-WP6). \u2022 The development of optimized final components will be insured by the combination of the new piezoelectric materials with the new electrode technology (WP7). \u2022 Industrial applications for the automotive-, production- and wind power industries.

As an application example, we will fulfil the consumer need for fast point-of-care discrimination between bacterial and viral infections.\nIn particular, IMPETUS will combine screen-, flexo- and inkjet-printing in a seamless roll-to-roll pilot line compatible to high-throughput fabrication. Here, the paper is employed as substrate for the printed circuits and a microchip, but also as active component of the printed battery as well as of the biosensor. This we will achieve by developing new technologies for paper manufacturing, coating and surface modification, and the respective processing will work hand in hand with the ink development (cellulose-based inks for fabricating the printed battery as well as bio-inks for surface functionalization and reagent deposition). A highly integrated and energy-efficient silicon microchip will be developed that enables electrochemical data acquisition, storage and contactless NFC transmission, and the microchip will be mounted onto the paper substrate by an inline placement process. \nIn summary, the IMPETUS pilot line will pave the way towards the real world application of paper-based quantitative electrochemical diagnostic test strips, thereby clearly advancing the current state-of-the-art, which up to now has mostly focussed on individual fabrication processes and device concepts.
