A great advantage of BANUS approach is to be able to guarantee food safety when using recycled materials (plastic and paper) even coming from non-authorized recycling processes in food packaging structures.\nThe project will consider the substitution of a percentage of virgin material by recycled material (paper or plastic) in the selected structures in order to develop more environmental friendly food packaging structures.

Special attention will be paid to the fact that the competences and the knowledge gained and transmitted during the course remain sustainable and transferable. This will be achieved by setting up enough space and time for reflection and evaluation, by providing expertise, comprehensive documentation, handouts and guidance from the team of trainers.

It is more widely a question of bringing the children to build themselves an European culture through the discovery of five participating cities : Athens, Belfast, Paris, Rome and Tallinn.The first step will be to go to the rediscovery of their own environment , their school and their district, in order to share it with the partners schools. Then the children will explore their city discovering its main monuments, its means of transport, the vision of their city by the artists. Finally, they will wonder how they can participate actively in the preservation and in the embellishment of their environment by simple ecological gestures .It is by the exchange of the productions of each school that the children will discover the patrimony of the partner cities.
