The aim of this project  is to gain new vocational skills by students.  During the training practice students get to know  the organizational structure of commercial enterprise and  modern accounting  programmes in a small firm.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we would like  our students to confront the Polish system of  vocational education with the English one and broaden the knowledge of   job market and enterprise and also to improve their  foreign   language competences. Taking  part in this project gives them a chance to get to know the economic  conditions of the partnership country and also increases their abilities to cope and exist in new, unknown surroundings. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial preparatory course organized by PZSE named  E.Kwiatkowski in Sandomierz, we plan to send  three groups of students, 16 students in each group with two   guardian teachers  for a three-week  vocational training practice in Great Britain. The training practice will consist of two modules ; training in accounting companies and also the course of the British accounting, where the objective is to operate financial and accounting programmes in a small company.  \r\n\r\nThe basic purpose of the training practice is to check their practical knowledge and skills gained during their education at school , in vocational lessons and to get to know the environment of vocational economist , the work environment in another country and willingness to cooperate in the future, support the abilities to adapt and make students sensitive and aware of mental and cultural differences.\r\n\r\nThe  additional purpose , still of great importance, coming from the fact that this  training  practice will take place in Great Britain, there will be comparison of introduction and doing expenses of small companies by  accounting offices,  which will be visited by our students.  The aim of this practice is to see  the differences between the Polish and English accountancy connected with  specific documents.  The Beneficiaries will be able to  draw conclusions about  companies  functioning in Poland and  in Great Britain.  Another aim is to get to know vocational vocabulary.  Additional  value will be getting to know  the British culture and customs  by students.\r\n\r\nTechnical  Economic  in  Upper  Secondary School  named  E. Kwiatkowski  in Sandomierz  and its foreign partner will do all the responsibilities  so that the  training practice could be successful and work  according to its schedule.  Participants of the training practice , thanks to these gained skills, will be valuable workers in the field of accountancy.  On the basis of our local employer analysis , we can say that the key  competences which are  required from future  workers  are:\r\n\r\n-having  high practical knowledge in operating financial and accounting programmes\r\n\r\n-having vocational practice  in a company using financial and accounting  programmes\r\n\r\n-being fluent in at least one foreign language ; general  language and vocational  language knowledge\r\n\r\nStudents who graduate school , we can regard them as not suitable on the job market. It is connected with little work experience of young workers coming into  the job market and lack of funds  for  vocational  education and creating and setting up their own business. Employers  demand vocational experience  in the field of accountancy , therefore, it is significant to reinforce practical education  during  school education and make  use of the European funds  dedicated  to lifelong education. That is why, a good solution is to take part in  the project of Erazmus  plus.  In addition, students  acquire prestige , which is  a positive and added  value  and the chances of a graduate increase as far as getting a job is concerned,  because expectations of a potential employer are met to a bigger extent.  There  are also many other chances such as:\r\n\r\n-European measure of oneself education\r\n\r\n-ability to communicate in a foreign  vocational language\r\n\r\n-Europass  Mobility certificate\r\n\r\nThe profits  mentioned above , to a certain extent make  better the situation of a young worker  on the job  market and increase his chances for employment.", "http://www.polarisen.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA102-000408_1"], ["4LF", "Sta\u017ce zagraniczne  szans\u0105 na zatrudnienie", "Polaris EU Enterprise Limited", 109884.0, "The main aim of the project \u201cInternational trainings \u2013 the opportunity for employment\u201d within the frameworks of Erasmus+ programme is the opportunity for 48 students to undergo a three week training abroad.

It has been specialising in serving groups of Polish students and teachers coming to Great Britain to have a vocational training, apprenticeship or to share experience.\r\nThe main aims of the project are improving professional and language skills of the participants and making sure that there are no barriers or differences concerning workplaces in the united Europe. It is also important to raise the students\u2019 motivation to improve and develop their professional and language skills. It is crucial to enhance their sense of belonging to the European community.

In the autumn of 2014, a group of 8 students studying landscape architecture will leave for the apprenticeship (with 1 teacher) and a group of 8 students studying in the field construction (with 1 teacher as well). In the spring of 2015, 8 students of landscape architecture with a teacher and a group of 8 students of hotel business with a teacher will count for the second mobility. The students of ZSTiO come mainly from the rural areas with a high unemployment rate. Most of them come from incomplete families with only one parent and with a low financial status. The great majority of ZSTiO students have never been abroad so far.\r\nThe activity planning concerning the project implementation was based on the rules and criteria included in the European Quality Charter for Mobility. The preparations to the Mobility will include logistic planning, promotion, recruitment, a course preparing the students for the foreign apprenticeship and signing the contracts. During the mobility the students will have the care and support of the sending institution and the partner institution.

In the opinion of our local employers ( employers conducted interviews with industry economic , mechanical and IT industry ) perfect employee should be characterized not only diligence , honesty and integrity , but also to high professional qualifications, experience acquired during the apprenticeship and become at least one foreign language , because a large portion of traders executes orders outside the country.
