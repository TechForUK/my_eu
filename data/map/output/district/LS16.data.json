We intend to bring together staff from various departments within our school in order to increase the European dimension of our teaching and also to reinforce each other's subjects through cross curricular projects.\r\n\r\nAnother important aspect of our project is based upon the fact that our school is now receiving a high number of pupils with English as an additional language and we would like to offer the best possible support to these pupils.\r\n\r\nWe intend, over the course of 24 month, to send 23 members of staff to do structured training courses in either France or Spain. These members of staff will be from various departments in school including, MFL, English, EAL, Art, DT, ICT and PE. The visits will also involve senior management and business support staff in order to ensure that the results of the project are embedded in the day to day life of the school.\r\n\r\nThe courses will involve a mixture of intensive language learning, cultural immersion, teaching methodology and the opportunity to make links with schools in Spain and France.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities will be one aspect of a wide ranging project involving all staff in the above departments. The outcomes will include; a great increase in the European dimension of our teaching which will be seen through revised schemes of work and an increase in cross curricular projects. This will motivate and engage our pupils and increase attainment across many subject areas, particularly literacy and EAL.\r\n\r\nOur school will become an example of how to integrate the European dimension into teaching and also into the everyday life of the school. We intend that our pupils will have increased aspirations and will consider future careers in European countries and beyond. Equally our staff's career aspirations and opportunities will be increased.\r\n\r\nOur pupils will be engaged learners. They will have access to excellent resources and high quality teaching. They will also have the opportunity to have regular class time contact with pupils in the French and Spanish schools through eTwinning.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the project we will have achieved the Advanced International Schools Award.\r\n\r\nThrough doing this project we will then be in a position to offer support to other schools. We will increase our work with our feeder primary schools and encourage them to take part in international mobility activities.

We also hope to improve links with our local secondary school to improved transition. \r\n\r\nWe will meet these needs through developing a two-year project involving sending staff on training courses in Spain and France to develop their skills to be able to achieve these aims. The courses involve language learning, cultural activities, methodology and pedagogy, professional discussion and time in a Spanish and French primary school.\r\n\r\nThis will result in more language learning options available to our children and languages being available to more children as we will introduce language teaching into KS1 one and EYFS, more staff being involved in the teaching of languages, better resources and teaching methodology. We will also have cross curricular links, which will lead to the reinforcement of literacy and will increase enjoyment of other subjects. Our pupils will become more internationally aware and will have more of an interest in other countries and cultures. Our staff will have better language knowledge, much more confidence and a better understanding of the best way to teach languages to young children. \r\n\r\nThe links we establish with our Spanish and French schools will greatly impact on language learning in our school. Our children will be more motivated and will find much more enjoyment in language learning. They will also be able to understand much better how Spanish and French children live and will realise that there are lots of similarities with their own lives. They will learn much more about Spanish and French culture in this way. We hope that this will lead to a long-term impact on their views about other countries and will allow them to build lasting friendships through penfriend scheme.\r\n\r\nAnother long term impact we envisage is an improvement in attainment of all our pupils, particularly those with low basic skills through improving teaching and introducing new methodologies and resources.

We need to equip sufficient teaching staff with the linguistic and cultural skills to be able to plan for, deliver and maintain a high standard of language teaching and assessment throughout the school. We want every child in our school to benefit from the experience that language learning can bring and to maximise on the enthusiasm and motivation that learning in the primary setting enables.\r\n\r\nCPD is of key importance to our staff development and we seek every opportunity available to enhance and develop our staff to become leading classroom practitioners. The opportunities presented within the project will support staff develop their linguistic and intercultural skills, which will in turn enhance their future career prospects.\r\n\r\nWe aim to maintain and deliver a very high standard of teaching and learning, across all subjects within the national curriculum, and will optimise the opportunities of this project to enhance teaching and learning in every subject.  As a school, we are very focussed on ensuring our learners develop an interest and understanding of the wider world. Through a number of key strategies we will celebrate diversity, and will use the impact, experience and learning from this project to further enhance our international programme of events. We believe that internationalization cannot be achieved without developing strong links communities in other countries, and will therefore seek to continue to develop communication links with French schools. These links will enable learners to exchange communication with native speakers.\r\n\r\nWe have thought carefully about the key ways to will monitor and evaluate the impact of our project, and have carefully devised some key strategies for our Project Team to follow.
