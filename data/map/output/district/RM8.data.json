Hence, the safetalkers debate is a unique platform that will cut across social and cultural barriers, as an informal European class of students that would go back to their schools and jointly head the debaters club.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profiles of Participants:\r\nOur participants will be students between the ages of 14 and 30 and their teachers from UK, Germany, France and Norway. And will be engaging in a Debate project taking place at the University of East London. The project will run for 6 days in a month for a duration of 9 months. During which time they will have the opportunity to bond with fellow participants and gain knowledge of the cultures and a carefully crafted London tour.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nMentoring sessions are organized for the students when they arrive the United Kingdom. Here, the theories and grammar will be gone over one final time by our hand picked English University students. Various teaching methods will be used during this time including:\r\nRole play\r\nBreathing techniques\r\nConfidence building activities.\r\nTeam building activities.\r\nAll of the above will happen bearing in mind that the students would have had a proper knowledge of the topics before arriving in the United kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe results and Impacts envisaged:\r\nJust some of the benefits our participants can expect to achieve during this project are;\r\n- An increased motivation on discussing social issues\r\n- Increased knowledge of internationalization strategies\r\n- Enhanced intellectual awareness\r\n- Improved English language skills \r\n- Expanded self empowerment/self esteem\r\n- The participants are encouraged and empowered by the mentors to go back and jointly head their debate clubs.\r\n\r\nPotential longer termed benefits:\r\nThe Debate itself will be recorded by an accomplished media company and televised on satellite channel \"Information Television\" in a series of programs named \"The Safe Talk\". All debates will also be available to view on our sister website www.signaturekids.co.uk.\r\n\r\n\"The Safe Talk\" will show participants in 2 groups debating over a specific topic. A moderator will be present to ensure its smooth running and each debate will also contain a main guest which will be an expert in the topic field to maximize the benefit participants and viewers receive from the discussion.\r\n\r\nTelevising the Debate means making it readily available to the millions of viewers that \"Information Television\" has. This ensures its impact on society and therefore achieves our goal of giving these students a voice. We strongly believe that once up and running this project will grow from strength to strength.", "http://www.oandmpartnership.org", "Tendercubs - O&M Partnership", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-012157_coordinator"], ["2EQ", "Business Education in Europe", "Tendercubs - O&M Partnership", 21305.0, "Due to globalisation vocational training programs require more and more international orientation. This applies especially to our trainees who are studying to work with foreign languages and are thus prepared for an occupation abroad or in relation to partners from different countries. To make sure that theoretical knowledge can be transferred to practical tasks and in order to create a close relation between the working world and vocational training programs, we integrate an eight-week period of work placement into our programs. It is particularly meaningful to carry out these work placements in other European countries, since markets are growing together and career opportunities improve on a joint European labour market.We scheduled the work placement period between the first and second year of our students\u2019 vocational training. On the one hand this means that they already gained a lot of knowledge relevant to their occupation and the language of their host country and on the other hand trainees get a valuable orientation concerning their career entry. In addition a work placement in a foreign country strengthens young people\u2019s social skills such as intercultural competence and self-confidence which are necessary for a successful and content professional and private life.In 2016 and 2017 alltogether 20 students will do an eight week internship in a company in England, France or Spain and thus explore the european labour market.", "http://www.oandmpartnership.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003104_1"], ["2EQ", "European Child - Healthy Body, Clever Mind", "Tendercubs Preschool and Day Nursery", 123872.0, "Childhood is the most flexible, vulnerable period in human life. This is the time when present and future behaviour is shaped including the ones considering healthy lifestyle. It is determined by: physical activeness, prevention and correction of body posture, safety and both hygienic and nutritional habits. The results of numerous observations of our pupils, diagnosis of their psycho-motoric development, talks with their parents as well as analysis of reports about children\u2019s health in partners\u2019 countries seems to confirm these detrimental states. Therefore, we have decided to unite our efforts, share experience from previous projects which we participated in, exchange know-how and create an international group consisting of teachers from Poland, Spain, Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Cyprus and the United Kingdom. All of us are professionals in areas that are within our interests. Each of us specialises in a realm that the others would like to develop their skills in, exchange \u201egood practices\u201d. \r\nOur main aims:\r\nStarting a close cooperation among schools/pre-schools to exchange experience/share good practice and to work out new educational methodologies and techniques that would serve shaping the key competences, being a guarantee of children's successful and free participation in a democratic society in the future.\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n7 countries from EU, preschools and primary schools, all of them experienced in ICT, ecological education, healthy lifestyle, democratic education and/or teaching foreign languages. Teachers - BA/MA graduates, sometimes with additional qualifications (therapy, special pedagogics, language skills, ICT literacy), mostly experience in EU projects, some as participants and some as coordinators; some of the partners are eco schools; living in small villages and big cities; Children - aged 3-6 (pre-school), also with special educational needs because of various conditions (social, health, economic, racial and cultural aspects); Parents - a very diversified group - economically, socially, racially and with various cultural background; some experienced in being participants of EU projects;\r\nActivities:\r\nOur project activities will offer a specific training methodology for teachers and parents to acquire, promote and deliver to children basic nutrition education and healthy lifestyle competencies.  We are planning to organise a lot of activities for children and their families to make them more familiar with healthy lifestyle (workshops, picnics, family contests). There are also activities connected with democratic education and ICT as these are the key competences of the future. To make the content more understandable for children all schools/groups are going to choose a toy that will accompany children and visit partners  abroad. Teachers will improve their professional profile thanks to study visits while they will exchange good practices in all areas of our interest.\r\nEveryone interested in our ideas will have an access to a cookery blog and multimedia digital platform where we are going to share all results from lesson plans to the best recipes from all partner countries.\r\nResults:\r\nApart of hard results mentioned above, there are numerous soft ones. We are going to improve teaching skills in terms of organisation of classes and creation of educational resources promoting healthy lifestyle (new forms, methods and techniques).\r\nOur staff will develop their ICT abilities used in educational process as well as their language skills. Students will operate the IWBs easily. Children will also become aware of diversity of countries, nations and languages in Europe. Everyone will learn the importance of their choices both in terms of school life and their health. We hope that our activities will help parents change their lifestyle to support healthy and balanced development of their children. The last but not the least, each of us will be more determined to continue the international cooperation for the sake of the whole community.\r\nImpact:\r\nAt all levels starting with local up to the international, we will promote Erasmus+ initiatives foremost showing how positive they are for communities. Dissemination of project results and products, encouraging other schools towards starting and developing projects by sharing our experience, will be held via online websites like the blog or multimedia digital platform  but also by arranging \"open classes\" for other teachers from other schools and picnics for families.\r\nWe are sure that the project activities will contribute to permanent changes in our private and professional lives.", "http://www.tendercubs.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA201-002890_3"], ["2EQ", "The European Child :Learning by doing the 3 C's- Connect, Construct And  Create.", "Tendercubs - O&M Partnership", 109054.0, "This project \"The European Child :Learning by doing the 3'C's-connect, construct and create'' is based on the Cooperation and Innovation for Good Practices takeover. The project is composed of 6 pre-educational  institutions from different countries (Bulgaria, Turkey, Italy, Latvia,England, Finland) with 934 children aged 3-7 (85 special needs) and teachers with a different experience, knowledge, beliefs, but common objectives:\r\n1. To develop students\u2019 learning ability to construct knowledge by doing.\r\n2. To prepare 21st century students for a global society by  developing;\r\nLearning Skills which are critical thinking and problem solving, communications and collaboration, creativity and  innovation skills of students.\r\nLiteracy Skills which are Information and communication technologies (ICT) literacy skills of students.\r\nLife Skills which are flexibility and adaptability, initiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural interaction, productivity and accountability of students.\r\nLanguage Skills in which we aim to develop students' listening and speaking skills and creating reading and writing awareness in a foreign language and their mother tongue.\r\n3.

To develop process based learning: Learners create meaning and context by exploring new ideas and experiences, generating hypotheses, problem solving.\r\nThis project aiming to provide an innovative, constructive, learner centred and age appropriate pedagogical framework and materials aiming to provide benefit teaching. We will be working with Constructivist Teaching / Learning Method and its close relative theory ''Active Learning'' which are fundamental to the full development of children\u2019s abilities. We think early childhood is critical period to acquire key competences, skills and life skills. Because these competences and skills will be acquired easier by the children in early childhood and it gradually declines after.When children acquire these achievements actively in preschool , a good foundation will laid for successful accomplishments in both school education and daily life.The child who is learning by doing in preschool would be more active in following grades.So, this project will contribute to both enhancing the quality of early childhood education and following education life of children. In order to children's  active involvement in the learning process, teachers will  encourage children to observe and connect the new knowledge with their prior knowledge and construct and create their own knowledge  consequently when students learn by doing, permanent learning will occur. We prepared four teaching/learning activities in order to realize the objectives of our project:\r\nTo develop these skills and to provide active involvement of the students four different learning activities are determined and methodological materials will be produced in this process.\u201c Child of nature''; In this activity teachers will enable students to gaining experience in natural enviroment and gain flexibility  adaptability, initiative and self-direction, productivity and accountability skills. 2)\u201cI am an artist\u201d ; In this activity children will acquire artistic skills,collaboration and creativity skills with creative art implementations. 3)\"One child, two languages\u201d ; children will acquire listening and speaking skills and  reading and writing awareness in a foreign language and their mother tongue by \r\nWe have planned many activities to fulfill this project\r\n-Project  work group set up in each organization.\r\n-Surveys will be used for the teachers and parents at the beginning and at the end of the project.\r\n-Project brochure will be prepared.\r\n-Project information board established in every organization. \r\n-Project website will be prepared.\r\n-Teachers will organize parent meetings.\r\n-E-twinning project will be prepared.\r\nAt the end of the project, students will acquire learning skills, literacy skills, life skills and language skills by paticipating learning process actively.
