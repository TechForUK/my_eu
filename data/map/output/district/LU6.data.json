To answer identified needs, the Easily diStributed Personal RapId Transit (ESPRIT) project aims to develop a purpose-built, light weight L6 category electric vehicle that can be stacked together to gain space. Thanks to pioneering coupling systems, up to 8 ESPRIT vehicles can be nested together in a road train, 7 being towed for an efficient redistribution of fleets and a smartly-balanced and cost efficient transport system. Within the project, 2 user scenarios are foreseen: a one-way carsharing system within city centres and a last-kilometre personal mobility system to existing public transport infrastructures in peri-urban areas. These will be tested through 3 different geographical use cases (Glasgow, Lyon and L\u2019 L\u2019Hospitalet de LLobregat near Barcelona).\nThis innovative transport system concept will be demonstrated to TRL5 though state-of-the-art developments of diverse technological bricks (including vehicle and road train architecture, coupling and guiding systems, kinetic and dynamic behaviour management systems, efficient energy supply and rapid charge battery strategies). To prove the ESPRIT concept, the project will also work on modelling and simulation tools to predict, once ESPRIT vehicles are deployed, the economic, social and environmental benefits as well as key operating strategies.\nThis concept will incite citizens to use public transport and carsharing solutions rather than their private vehicles leading to seamless intermodal transport, decongestion, significant reduction of noise and air pollution. To reach all stakeholders, the ESPRIT project will not only rely on its technical expertise but also on the knowledge and network of its end user community represented by several partners as well as the Advisor Board which includes carsharing organisations, public authorities and transport operators.", 318177.0, 6542631.0, "ESPRIT", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194859_932647823"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3HD", "Integrated European Model for\r\n\r\nRehabilitation of Victim and Offender Children", "Diagrama Foundation Psychosocial Intervention", 155092.0, "The project EURehab Children aims at establishing an integrated approach towards Rehabilitation of Victim and Offender Children. The Ministry of Family and Social Policies of Turkey has 52 Rehabilitation Centers called KBRM (Koruma Bak\u0131m ve Rehabilitasyon Merkezi) and BSRM (Bak\u0131m ve Sosyal Rehabilitasyon Merkezi). These 52 Centers have no common Rehabilitation model for the proffesionals and thus this leads to unhealthy and ineffective rehabilitation. Besides, lack of integrated Rehabilitation system seems a Europe-wide issue. Each partner across Europe (Diagrama- UK, CSCS- IT, FAMYLIAS- ES, Provest-TR), which has deep expertise in Juvenile Rehabilitation and VET, will analyze the current state of art and draw best practices across Europe. Then a handbook of best practices will be created with the contribution of all partners. Four different modules will be developed as Module 1: Rehabilitation of Offenders and Victims Exposed to Violent Crimes, Module 2: Rehabilitation of Offenders and Victims Exposed to Sexual Crimes, Module 3: Rehabilitation of Offenders and Victims Exposed to Drug Abuse, Module 4: Rehabilitation of Offenders and Victims Exposed to Abuse and Neglect.\r\n\r\nCombining these modules and taking best practices into account, an innovative curriculum will be developed while various training materials will be developed simultaneously. These developed modules will be implemented twice in KBRMs and BSRMS and the evaluations will take place after each implementation. After that there will be a policy recommendation document created and distributed to relevant policy making local institutions and public authorities. At the last phase, there will be an International Conference organized with 30 foreign and 240 domestic participants. All dissemination channels will be used through the EURehab Children project; project website, leaflets, social media, books, DVD etc. Including policy recommendation document, all projects output will be translated into partners' national languages.\r\n\r\nThe project ultimately aims to offer an integrated and innovative training and teaching method for Rehabilitation professionals, which will finally benefit the social inclusion of the offender and victim children.
