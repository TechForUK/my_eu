We intend to do this through changing the structure of our language teaching from the current model to a model where we work together as a whole school to embed language learning into classroom routines and other curriculum areas meaning that our children will have a much more complete experience of learning a language. This project will enable our 36 teachers in Key Stage I, 2 and EYFS to feel confident enough to plan and deliver languages to their pupils.\r\n\r\nWe have developed a project that will involve sending staff on training courses in Spain and France. The courses include various elements relevant to our needs, for example they include intensive language classes which will enable our staff to quickly assimilate new language skills. They also include cultural activities and information, sessions on language teaching methodology, input on areas relevant to our needs such as using ICT to support language learning, how to support our pupils with special educational needs and ways to integrate language learning across the curriculum. \r\n\r\nAll of this will result in our pupils feeling much more confident in their use of languages as they will be able to use Spanish and French much more regularly and also they will be able to see the relevance of learning about languages and culture as this will be put in a context.\r\n\r\nWe will develop strong and lasting links with schools in Spain and France leading to regular communication ad joint project work. This will give them an invaluable insight into life in a different culture. Teachers will develop supportive professional relationships that will last for years to come and mean that they have a source of help and support for the future. We will make our language learning experience more enjoyable through using tools such as eTwinning on a regular basis. By creating a more interesting and enjoyable language learning experience for our pupils, we intend to increase the uptake of languages at GCSE in our school.\r\nWe also intend to improve the language learning experience for our pupils with special educational needs and to find innovative and creative ideas to allow us to do this. We also intend to use the project to find new ways of using ICT within language learning and look for how we can make best use of the ICT resources we already have in school. A further objective of the project is to increase parental and community involvement in our school life. \r\n\r\nWe have planned a two year project which will involve teachers, senior managers and support staff from across key stages taking part in immersion training in Spain and France. We would like to send 10 members of staff to Spain and 4 to France as part of this project. They will take part in training courses which will involve intensive language learning, cultural information, teaching methodology, time spent in Spanish and French school and discussion of issues relating to the development of foreign languages in schools.\r\n\r\nThis is a large-scale project, involving a large number of staff members. Therefore, the impact will be far reaching. There will be a huge impact on the way languages are taught in our school. We will move from our current model of specialist teacher input with no follow-up to a new model of provision whereby many more members of staff are involved in teaching languages.\r\n\r\nLanguage learning will be more enjoyable due to this new approach, the use of better materials and the improved confidence of teachers. This will impact on our children\u2019s attainment.\r\n\r\nTeachers will develop new skills and will feel confident and able to teach languages to their class. \r\n\r\nMembers of staff taking part in the visits will be involved in working together to develop training packages and activities which will be used to share information and skills with the rest of our staff. This will support further development of teaching skills and more cross curricular work. Participants will also develop training packages to be used with other schools in our area. \r\n\r\nWe will develop training sessions for parents focusing on basic language and culture. This will mean that parents are able to develop their own skills and also that they are in a better position to be able to support their children in their learning. We will increase our provision of cultural events and activities which we will open to parents and the local community, encouraging them to be further involved in the life of the school. \r\n\r\nThere will be a positive impact on all pupils learning and we will specifically focus on the attainment of our pupils with special educational needs. They will benefit from improved resource link and better teacher knowledge leading to more appropriate teaching approaches that will help them to achieve their full potential.", "http://www.oakhillcollege.co.uk", "Oakhill College (Whalley) Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012756_coordinator"], ["9PN", "Kvalitat\u012bvas audz\u0113k\u0146u praskes", "Dinex Clamps Limited", 4022.0, "The aim of the project is to ensure and increase high-quality internships for students of vocational education institutions in the implementation of work-based training environment.

We want to consolidate progress across our whole school, and give a special focus to our primary language provision.\r\n\r\nA language is taught from Pre-school in EYFS and throughout KS1 and KS2 by specialist language teachers. The objective of the project is to train classroom teachers and teaching assistants to be able to support language teaching by improving their language competency and confidence. Our 18  participants include 4 teaching assistants based in EYFS and KS1&2, 1 SEN teacher based in KS1&2, 3 specialist language teachers, 5 EYFS, KS1 & KS2 class teachers, 5 KS3 teachers who also work with Prep classes and who are involved with transition from KS2.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve mobilities to France and Spain which will include an intensive language course and visits to our two link schools. \r\n\r\nBefore each mobility, staff will be given basic language training by the language teachers and will have their language competency assessed. They will be asked to complete a survey on their confidence and ability in languages. They will be briefed on the purposes of the project and asked to collect authentic resources and to consider how the methodologies they see could be used in their own lessons. \r\n\r\nAfterwards, they will complete a follow-up survey and be involved in the delivery of languages in Prep. \r\n\r\nActivities on the language course will include intensive language classes and information on language teaching activities which can be used with primary children.
