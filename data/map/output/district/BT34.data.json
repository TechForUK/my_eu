Having introduced Spanish to the school 3 years ago as part of the Primary Languages initiative by the Department of Education for Northern Ireland the staff and pupils have excelled in their basic language skills. There is  whole staff commitment to promoting the highest standard of language teaching and learning throughout the school from age 4 to age 11 .\r\nAll the children are actively engaged in songs and games that promote enjoyment in learning Spanish. The parents have increasing support for the learning Spanish and intercultural education and many  are  now attending  classes, this is an area we wish to develop in school  through providing our accommodation to promote such classes The Principal previously attended a Commenius funded course in Madrid and disseminated its content to colleagues very successfully. A group of teachers will be in Madrid at Easter to engage with further training in Spanish and and the Principal and Vice Principal will be on a self funded fact finding activity at the same time. \r\nOur main objectives for the 2 year programme will be to empower our teaching staff to deliver highly motivated active learning programmes. The focus areas are Language and Literacy (in particular talking and listening skills).  The teachers enhance their skills in speaking Spanish through games and effective use of technologies,  Drama and thinking skills in the classroom. The courses planned will facilitate better teaching methods, confident and enthusiastic professionals \r\nTwelve participants ranging from Principal to special needs teaching assistants will be involved over the next 2 years on linked courses in Europe. \r\nThe activities planned include in service training on new teaching methodologies for the classroom where participants will have the opportunity to meet and work alongside other professionals from across Europe. Participants while abroad be able to practice their spoken Spanish. Another activity will be how to a develop games based methodology in bilingual contexts within the classroom. A third activity  is aimed specifically at learning basic Spanish and this can be further developed back home to lead into  the participants taking a GCSE Spanish course.\r\nThe methodology to be used in carrying out the project will involve numerous staff meeting formal and informal so that everyone will have a clear focus on what they want to achieve both for themselves as well as fr the school.  The principal will manage the programme and provide regular feedback to the Board of Governors and other stakeholders as to to the success of the project at each stage. Pre course and post course evaluations will feature strongly and a written report will be provided on the school website outlining the achievements.\r\nThe longterm impact of the project will be to greatly improve the pupils language and literacy skills, more enjoyable and effective classroom strategies employed by each teacher. A greater understanding within the wider community of the importance of language awareness and competence if children are to achieve their full potential as members of a multicultural society. To promote tolerance and respect of different cultures and traditions,  in a European context that will remain with them for their whole lives.
