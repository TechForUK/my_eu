There will be a high priority given to teaching French, led by the class teachers. It will improve standards of reading and will carry other cross-curricular benefits. \r\n\r\n12 participants will attend week long immersion courses providing an opportunity for all Key Stage 2 teacher staff. The staff who are accountable for their pupils' progress will be the key target group of participants to attend the courses.\r\n\r\nCourse activities include bespoke language course taught by native French speakers. Cultural immersion in a French market town. Experience and connections made within a French primary school. Reviews, conferences and staff meetings to share skills gained with the rest of the school. \r\n\r\nThis will be carried out through links with PQ-France Ltd, who will lead the courses and manage many of the logistics. This is in close liaison with the project team, led by the subject leader and Head Teacher who will monitor and adjust the project to suit emerging needs.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the project, French will be seen, heard and enjoyed throughout the school in all classrooms and beyond. Staff will be confident and competent in their language skills which in turn will instil enthusiasm in the children. They will be employing skills gained and honed through the courses on a regular basis in their classrooms. Pupils will voice their views, their enthusiasm, and their suggestions for improving French through their school council representatives and ambassadors. \r\n\r\nPupils will go on to be successful and enthusiastic language learners, which will open doors for many children from a diversity of backgrounds. Staff will have many opportunities for professional development as they will carry these new skills with them and will continue to employ their skills to maintain their proficiency. \r\n\r\nFinally, the wider community will gain a greater enthusiasm and understanding of a new culture and will make connections with those who can promote the project and ideas for making their own contribution to Erasmus+ initiatives.", "http://www.wesleymethodistprimary.co.uk", "Wesley Methodist Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047201_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M26"}
