To be able to send a teacher to Spain for linguistic and cultural training was an opportunity that was too good for the school to miss. Blairgowrie High School aims to offer the best possible language training for young people and to that end, we want our staff to have the best possible training. \r\n\r\nThe course for which we have applied to the European Commission for funding is a three week language immersion course in Malaga, Spain. The course includes linguistic training to help participants gain confidence and proficiency in Spanish as well as cultural activities and excursions to deeper participants understanding of Spain and it's rich history. \r\n\r\nWe are sending a newly qualifies teacher on this course in order that he might be accredited by the General Teaching Council of Scotland to teach Spanish. He already teaches French at the school, but lacks the residency requirements set out by the GTCS. The funding received from Erasmus will allow this young man to teach two languages at the school which will allow the school to offer a wider variety of language courses to the young people it serves. \r\n\r\nThe course is an immersion course and therefor the participants will be expected to speak only in Spanish for the full 3 weeks. The course is run specifically for language teachers and so will focus on how to teach Spanish to young people and will involve sharing resources and ideas for the teaching of languages. We envisage that the participant will return with more confidence in Spanish and be ready to teach it and also with ideas, methodologies and resources to teach young people. \r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits will be that the school has the power to offer more language courses for the young people who attend and we will raise the schools European profile. We hope that through this project we can foster links with other European schools and that we can in turn broaden the horizons of the young people we teach here at Blairgowrie High School.", "http://www.blairgowriehs.org.uk", "Blairgowrie High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013273_coordinator"]]}}, "7ER": {"cordis": {"data": [[1346457600000, 1472601600000, "ENERGY EFFICIENCY FOR EU HISTORIC DISTRICTS SUSTAINABILITY", "A. Proctor Group Limited", "Europe can become the leader in CO2 emission reduction by applying innovative solutions to its built cultural heritage. According to the European Recovery Plan one of the actions that needs to be taken to tackle the current crisis, is investing in energy efficiency. Historic urban buildings consume 4% of all energy and are responsible for 3% of CO2 emissions. Therefore, improving energy efficiency in historic buildings and historic districts is essential.\n\nNevertheless, most of the current developments in energy efficiency address new construction without dealing with the unique problems of historic structures. A number of technologies and products have been developed, however many of the solutions are not acceptable for historic structures due to the necessity of preserving integrity and authenticity.\n\nTherefore, the main goal of EFFESUS is to develop and demonstrate, through case studies a methodology for assessing and selecting energy efficiency interventions, based on existing and new technologies that are compatible with heritage values.  A Decision Support System will be a primary deliverable. The environment in historic buildings and urban districts is controlled differently from modern cities and accordingly the project will also develop a multi-scale data model for the management of energy. In addition, new non-invasive, reversible yet cost-effective technologies for significantly improving thermal properties will also be developed. Finally, existing regulations and building policies may not fit cultural heritage specificities so the EFFESUS project will also address these non-technical barriers.\n\nThese outcomes will be achieved through 10 work packages, performed by an interdisciplinary consortium of 23 partners from 13 countries. Due to the attractiveness of this niche market, 36 % of the project budget is allocated to SME\u2019s, which will work together with large companies, research institutions and end users throughout the duration of the project.", 95645.0, 5383898.0, 13, 27, "EFFESUS", "http://www.effesus.eu/", "http://www.proctorgroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/153629.jpg", "fp7_105775_953436475"]]}}, "7JB": {"fts": {"data": [[2016, "CASTLE WATER LIMITED", 69.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_66863"], [2016, "CASTLE WATER LIMITED", 46.0, "Buildings and related expenditure \u2014 Commission Representations (16.01.03.03)", "fts_2016_70653"]]}}}}
