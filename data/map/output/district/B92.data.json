The tide of economics and regulation is moving in favour of natural gas, yet the infrastructure has proven too expensive and too inflexible to meet demand  both conveniently and economically. Gas grid infrastructure has defined the location of cheap gas, as mobile solutions are not scaleable and too expensive for mass adoption. \n\nGlobal trends identified in this proposal show that rapid gas adoption rates have been closely linked to the provision of infrastructure beyond a critical mass level, a process we believe we can rapidly accelerate. \n\nCNG Fuels have pioneered the concept of using high pressure gas grid connections to build Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) refuelling stations which produce the lowest cost gas, with the lowest emissions profile, and produce it far more abundantly than other stations throughout Europe. Our new CNG Station in Leyland, is feeding a customer's off grid 'daughter' station via CNG trailer.\n\nWhat is becoming clear to us is that we can sell a lot more gas to a lot more fleets by focussing our high pressure 'mother' stations on the provision of very cheap gas to CNG trailers for them to then fuel vehicles at 'daughter' stations, located where the customers want them, i.e. close to the depot or on the major transport routes. \n\nWe intend to build stations that focus on fuelling large numbers of CNG trailers simultaneously. Locating our mother stations where the cheapest gas can be produced, i.e. the cheapest land, close to highest pressure gas grid. Our production levels will provide us bulk gas and electricity discounts as a high volume user. We can pass the savings on to our customers so that they can transport the gas and still supply it cheaply.  \n\nThe vastly improved economics of owning 'daughters', will rapidly boost the network effect, and the adoption rates of gas throughout Europe.", 39838.0, 56912.0, 1, 1, "MDC", null, null, null, "h2020_200332_924125112"]]}}, "7EG": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "INSPIRE, DEVELOP, CHANGE: using effective collaboration within the European dimension to enhance teaching and learning at greater depth.", "Our Lady of Compassion School", 8236.0, 1, 1, "Our school is a larger than an average, fully inclusive Catholic school. We consider our school to be a family where each is unique and special and all have an important part to play in contributing towards the success of the school.  The school ethos has a powerful effect on the children\u2019s behaviour and attitudes, providing them with a sound basis for making good choices. The cohort of the school extends beyond its catchment area, catering for families who wish to provide their children with a Catholic education. The vast majority of the pupils speak English as their first language. The proportion of pupils who are eligible for free school meals and for whom the school receives additional income (the pupil premium) is below average. The proportion supported with a Statement of Special Educational Needs / Education Health and Care Plan is well above the national average.At our school we have a dedicated, enthusiastic team of teaching and non-teaching staff who continually strive to offer the very best education for all our children. Our curriculum is rich and exciting and is designed to engage and inspire, encouraging children to develop skills, acquire knowledge and develop a love of learning. All children are given many opportunities to learn, both within the classroom, in the school grounds, in the wider locality and beyond. Nonetheless, we always strive to extend our skills and expertise and to develop our teaching and learning so as to provide the children with the best learning experiences possible. For this reason, we are keen to send 5 members of our staff (the Head Teacher and 4 teachers from different key stages) to participate in training courses. This will gain them invaluable experience and expertise which they will then be able to disseminate to the rest of the staff and impact change.The choice of title for our project, 'INSPIRE, DEVELOP, CHANGE: using effective collaboration within the European dimension to enhance teaching and learning at greater depth', was chosen to indicate the process that the participants will go through as part of this experience. Through their experience within the European dimension, they will be able to inspire the rest of the staff to enhance and develop their teaching and learning and impact change.The school's main objectives were chosen to tie in with the objectives on our SDP:- Improving the teaching and learning by enhancing the staff's expertise; further developing the creative and innovative approaches for delivering the curriculum; - Improving the outcomes for all pupils by developing new learning methods and strategies for ensuring appropriate levels of challenge and support;  - Developing leadership skills in staff;- Embedding new processes to ensure that the children make the necessary progress to achieve their potential; - Further developing communication with parents to benefit the learning experience of the children.To address our objectives we have identify structured training courses in Italy, Finland, Germany, Sweden and Belgium which will be attended by 5 staff chosen for their interest, motivation and ability to share good practice and drive chance following their experience. The following learning outcomes are envisaged as a result of this project:- Greater awareness of the educational systems in other countries- Enhanced staff expertise and subject knowledge - Enhanced teaching and learning teaching across all key stages - improved outcomes for all pupils through the development of new learning methods and strategies for ensuring appropriate levels of challenge and support- Better understanding of creative and innovative methods delivering the curriculum - increased confidence in teaching methods used for successful learning- Enhanced leadership skills- Increase in motivation in staff- New processes embedded and having a positive impact on ensuring that the children make the necessary progress to achieve their potential- Communication with parents further developed to benefit the learning experience of the children.All of these outcomes will have a longer term impact as the change becomes embedded in normal practice and the practice of others as we plan to integrate the new skills, knowledge and competencies in out schools curriculum. We also plan to share this will colleagues in our wider network impact in the long term on a much wider audience.", "http://www.olc.solihull.uk", "Our Lady of Compassion School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-024041_coordinator"]]}}}}
