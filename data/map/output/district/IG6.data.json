The intention of the project is to allow our students gaining inside experiences into working processes in an European country in the field of logistics. During their four weeks internship in England at SDV Ltd., they will have the chance to expand their professional skills in logistics, practice their language compentence and and experience working in an international environment. Living and working abroad will enable our students to deepen their understanding on other countries and cultures and working in a Britsh company.\r\nWorking abroad is a mandatory part for obtaining the certificate of our bilingual program in logistics. It is our goal to prepare students for working in international contexts either abroad or in their home countries but in international teams or with international business partners.\r\nAll applicants for this scholarship are participating to a full extend in our bilingual program and are working for obtaining the certificate at the end of our program which will be in the summer of 2015. In addition to an internship abroad, participants will complete 10 courses in logistics in English or bilingually English and German. Courses in intercultural competence, international project management and risk management will also be mandatory parts of their qualification. Thus, theoretical training in courses as well as practical experiences abroad can be viewed as complementary elements in our program. These trainings and the overall bilingual program support students in their decision to go abroad and gain international experiences that will qualify them for international cooperation in their professional future.
