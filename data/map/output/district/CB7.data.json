It is the concept of space that makes spatial thinking a distinct form of thinking. It is a basic and essential skill that can and should be learned, alongside other skills like language, mathematics and science.\r\n2) The knowledge and capability to use GIScience and Geographical Information (GI) is not only essential as a basic skill, it also offers significant job opportunities. However at the moment there is a clear mismatch between workforce demand and supply.  The GI sector is in many countries a shortage occupation sector. \r\n3) One of the priorities of the European Union the last decade has been the promotion of \u201cdigital literacy.\u201d  The GIScience tools used are a perfect answer to this.\r\n\r\nAlthough some materials are already available for schools, teachers do not tend to use them in their class practice. The main blocking factor is that the notion of GIScience, GI or spatial thinking is uncommon in the curriculum of almost all European countries.\r\nIf we want to overcome the chasm which at the moment prevents introducing GIScience in schools, we must introduce and institutionalize it inside the curricula of the schools. This must be done taken into account the level of difficulty connected to the age group.
