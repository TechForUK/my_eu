Initially, counterbalance forklifts were fitted with internal combustion (IC) engines using diesel or LPG. However these emit polluting and hazardous gases and are unsuitable for indoor use. Electric forklifts produce zero emissions during use and are noiseless, permitting indoor application but also have shortcomings as they are not ideal for outside use and so operators require different forklifts for indoor and outdoor use, with forklifts costing from \u20ac25,000 to \u20ac90,000.\n\nNexen Transport have developed a novel hybrid counterbalance forklift truck using both an IC engine and electric power to deliver excellent performance in both indoor and outdoor use for large logistic entities with both indoor and outdoor operations such as freight, logistics, retail and wholesale companies. FlexiHyLift will deliver a new range of intelligent, environmentally friendly, highly efficient, versatile and cost effective counterbalance forklift trucks with benefits including:\n\u2022 Light, modular power pack with a lithium ion battery with super capacitor capability and is re-chargeable through the hydraulic system of the forklift.\n\u2022 Can be switched from IC power to battery power during indoor and outdoor use respectively.\n\u2022 High-energy efficiency and cost effectiveness owing to the novel modular, hybrid power pack. The power pack recovers energy during the IC engine operation through a small, highly efficient IC range extender engine.\n\nDuring Phase 1 we will conduct a market usage analysis with companies that have both indoor and outdoor operations to determine the specific industry requirements so as to produce an optimal solution.\n\nIn Phase 2 we intend to fully integrate the IC engine and electric power system together resulting in a fully operational hybrid forklift.", 35842.0, 51203.0, "FlexiHyLift", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196242_938123764"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4AH", "The Broadening Horizons Project", "Ormiston Academies Trust", 56974.0, "Ormiston Denes Academy is a secondary school with academy status located in the northern outskirts of Lowestoft in Suffolk. We have around 940 students aged 11 to 16.\r\n\r\nWe teach French, Spanish, and, from September 2018. German.\r\n\r\nWe have a whole school ethos of relentless raising of standards of achievement and developing high quality staff training to ensure all our students receive the highest quality provision.\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure that we are equipped to improve our pupils\u2019 attainment across the curriculum and particularly in foreign languages,  increasing the use of target language within MFL and also in non-MFL areas.\r\n\r\nWe need to raise the profile of languages across the school and develop staff skills so that they are able to offer support to other schools within the Ormiston Trust, our partner primary schools and other local schools. We need to develop training projects with our link primaries to share good practice and resources and develop smooth transition.\r\n\r\nWe need to take a whole school approach to promoting Intercultural Understanding, developing positive attitudes and rejecting stereotypes.\r\n\r\nWe plan develop a whole school project involving collaborative working across several different departments, offering mobility training activities for 27 members of staff from a range of departments and backgrounds. Details are in Section H. The courses include language learning, culture, teaching methodology and pedagogy, professional discussion and the opportunity to spend time in a European school. This will be a whole school approach which will lead to fundamental changes in our practice, benefiting all of our pupils across the school and with a particular focus on supporting pupils with EAL.\r\n\r\nEnabling staff members to improve their language awareness, cultural knowledge and experience of other teaching approaches will significantly impact on the internationalisation of our school. We will incorporate good practice observed in European schools into our own teaching and share our best practice. Pupils will increase their understanding and curiosity about different cultures, and language and culture will become much more embedded into other subject areas. Target language will be used throughout the day in different departments with  better use of resources and a more international learning environment. We will develop new Schemes of Work that will reflect our more cross curricular, international approach.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure that all of our pupils have a really positive experience of language learning which will encourage positive learning attitudes, and find ways to give them more insight into other cultures and ways of life, developing positive attitudes and rejecting stereotypical views.\r\n\r\nWe will aim to involve cross-section of staff in terms of experience year groups and subject areas.\r\n\r\nWe will include; \r\n\r\nCover supervisors \u2013 required to cover lessons in teachers\u2019 absence, which includes covering language lessons\r\n\r\nTeachers of English \u2013 hoping to enthuse students about other cultures and texts; develop their confidence and competence to become more effective teachers \r\n\r\nMaths and science teachers \u2013 will be able to share their subject specific expertise with the schools we visit \r\n\r\nPE staff \u2013 hoping to establish international links\r\n\r\nHeads of house \u2013 working with a large number of students on a daily basis, which include EAL and disadvantaged students. Greater foreign language competence will enable them to communicate with the students and their parents more effectively.\r\n\r\nWe are aware from discussion with other schools who have undertaken successful Erasmus+ projects that it is essential that there is clear project leader and a clear project plan.\r\n\r\nThis is a whole school project and dissemination will play a vitally important role. We have a clear dissemination strategy and the project leader will take a leading role in organising and managing this. The participants will come from a wide range of different departments. They will fully inform their colleagues about all aspect of the project through regular staff meetings and we will also have whole school staff meetings to update colleagues, pass on learning outcomes and encourage them to become actively involved in the process of improvement and internationalisation.\r\n\r\nVarious means of evaluation are already in place:  formal school performance systems, pupil voice and parents\u2019 surveys, staff and parents\u2019 questionnaires and opinion polls; teachers\u2019 assessments of students\u2019 progress, informal learning walks and formal observations. As much as possible, we will link evaluation of the project to these mechanisms. We will look to develop new measures where these do not already exist.\r\n\r\nA multidepartmental project of this scale will have an enormous impact across our whole school, helping us to achieve the excellence we strive for in every area.", "http://www.ormistondenes.co.uk/", "Ormiston Academies Trust", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046815_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR32"}
