It accounts for 11% of total European GDP and is a major contributor to EU employment and the competitiveness of many other industrial sectors  This project, involving two SMEs and one University, concerns a rapid development of a European capability in electric drivetrains for low-carbon vehicles, with focus on urban electric vehicles and commercial vehicles, in order to meet the urgent needs of a rapidly growing market, in particular in London and other European cities.  The proposed electric drivetrain is based on the novel concept of a Vehicle Independent Electric Transmission Architecture (VIETA) system, which has been provisionally filed for patent application by Cranfield University. The timely delivery, within the next two years, of a technology demonstration of the VIETA system will significantly enhance the EU\u2019s capability to develop low carbon vehicles with urgency. It will also helps to achieve the long term goal of decarbonisation of road transport, as emissions avoided now are more valuable than those saved later.   This is a people-centred program to mobilize the human capitals of the participating organization so that enhanced and new capability in road transport, and in particular electric drivetrain, is to be developed. For the 10 seconded researchers involved, the VIETA project provides significantly leveraged resources for effective acquisition of new skills, and refreshed career prospects. For the newly recruited researcher, the aim is to develop an accelerated and excellent career within a unique academic-industry partnership over two years. Budgeted at 380k euro, the project thus provides signficant benefits for the EU, with good prospect of high returns for investment, in terms of new and enhanced capability in a key automotive market. and the creation of new jobs and wealth for the EU citizens.", 5312.0, 285621.0, "VIETA", null, null, null, null, "http://www.naro.co.uk", null, "fp7_100617_997184542"], ["4SN", "A rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, analytical device for bacterial or viral infection diagnosis through ultra-high sensitivity breath analysis.", "Imspex Diagnostics Limited", "The world faces a growing epidemic of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); however, only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to the market in the last 30 years. The discovery and development of new antibiotics is essential to maintain medical advances but poses significant scientific, clinical, and financial challenges, particularly for antibiotics active against Gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli). Such bacteria have effective barriers against drugs, making treatment difficult, resistance likely and development costs and risks high. In addition, any new antibiotics brought to the market would likely be used cautiously to delay the development of resistance, adding an additional financial challenge in recouping the development costs. The O\u2019Neill Report on AMR identifies diagnostics as critical to the battle against antibiotic resistance.\n\nThis innovation action, BreathSpec, proposes a viable solution to the global problem of AMR through the final developmental stages of an existing diagnostic device, which will allow a rapid, binary decision to be made on the need for antibiotic treatment, and which with suitable optimisation will allow further differentiation and stratification to take place. The Innovation Action includes technical developments to optimise its function, data acquisition for the development of the decision making analytical function and clinical validation.\n\nIt addresses these issues by producing reliable identification and quantification of key signature volatiles present in exhaled breath. It provides a non-invasive method for monitoring the volatile organic compounds present in an individual\u2019s exhaled breath (and subsequently the blood) and has long been recognised as having significant utility as a clinical test that can be used for early disease detection and monitoring, and potentially to diagnose specific bacterial infections for better, more targeted use of existing antibiotics.", 1001204.0, 2914227.0, "BreathSpec", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210626_917908479"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4UQ", "International Youth Conference: Europe is alive with colours", "Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council", 16649.0, "Against the background of rising voices calling for the fortress Europe, a return to former national borders and a rising distrust of everything unknown, 47 youngsters and their teamers come from 11 twin towns of Ravensburg to work on the topics of culture, openness, diversity and tolerance.
