That makes it more difficult to do justice to each of the students in his / her particular academic and social situation. As a consequence there is an increasing number of students who fail grammar school. Additionally, classroom management has become a hard task, as we try to struggle with different approaches to under- and overachievers. When visiting our partner school in Bishop Auckland, England, on a project, we were impressed by learning that teachers there have successfully used differentiation techniques in classrooms for many years. So the idea was born to profit from the rich experience in England by job-shadowing our colleagues - learning from experienced European partners instead of starting all over again and making unnecessary mistakes.As we have two bilingual classes in each year in which certain subjects are taught in English (e.g. history, geography, biology) we have chosen those subjects as a first group for our job-shadowing. The second group will concentrate on languages, expecting to profit richly from ideas how to stimulate different abilities. The third group will look at mathematics, a subject in which the gap between different abilities and the possibility of failure are particularly obvious.We are planning to go to England twice with groups of 4 colleagues each to be able to compare and to develop and learn from the first experience. We have practised \"open doors\" in our schol for many years now, inviting colleagues into our classes to learn from each other; and we have developed a system of feedback culture by the students which helps us to improve continually. Furthermore, a large group of colleagues is trained to use cooperative learning in classrooms. That means that we have both the structure and the motivation to implement in our curriculum what we will learn.Our aim is to be able to develop more measures for all students, including those with special needs and with migration experience. We aim at sharing our experience with other schools in our region and further, learning from European partners and including other countries too in the future.We are also planning to take courses that support our focus and in order to be able to include more colleagues in our project.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA101-022683_1"], ["6JT", "Narrowing the gap between higher and lower achievers", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", 7667.0, "Our project is driven by one thing, to improve our ability as educators to help our disadvantaged students who are not progressing as well as our more socioeconomically better off counterparts. We are aiming to narrow the gap between these learners and have identified our partner school in Galicia as an ideal school to work with. We are aiming to un-pick what it is that they do to ensure that all students progress as well as each other and that being labeled by 'Ofsted' as a disadvantaged student does not mean they can not reach their potential. We are aiming to look at five subject areas (MFL, Science, Maths, Art  and Music) where we have identified certain individual students who are not reaching their potential. We have in conjunction with our Spanish school selected 6 members of staff from 5 subject areas all who will be each looking at a strand of teaching and learning we feel directly contributes to our disadvantaged students under performance. We have selected a broad spectrum of subjects to see if there is any differentiation between the progress of these students in less academic subjects versus a practical approach to teaching. Our project will be to work as a team to visit our partner school and look at how they have managed to narrow the gap so effectively over the past 3 years and look for the reasons why St. John's has such an issue with the progress of our disadvantaged students and why it has been part of our learning improvement plan for the past three years and we still haven't made any progress towards finding out a way to narrow the gap between the achievement of the aforementioned learners? We will use our students as a case study to take to Spain and shadow similar students in our Spanish partner school who are out performing ours, what do they do that helps them to progress well?, what teaching and learning techniques are used to ensure they improve?, how do staff differentiate to allow these students to fly?, are there cultural aspects that allow students to progress better than our students? and does the Spanish curriculum in practice have anything to offer that we could implement in our school. Is their anything that more practical subjects offer our disadvantaged students that helps them to improve? This coupled with each member of the working party focusing on one key strand we hope will allow us to effect change on the school as a whole.We as a working party of six members of staff have been chosen to tackle this extremely challenging task that as a school we have prioritised. We envisage that the methodology and approaches that we will learn in Spain will allow us to help our students to improve, the long term benefits will be rolled out to the whole school via CPD sessions ran by the working party taking part in the project. The overall aim is to reduce the aforementioned gap of 23% between our disadvantaged learners and those who come to us from a more privileged background.  Our creating of baseline assessments will allow us to monitor the progress of students throughout the progress which links directly to annual appraisal and performance reviews of staff, we will also take on regular feedback from students to see what impact our new approaches have on their learning.Our aim to travel together we feel optimises the opportunity for group reflection, allow lessons learned via job-shadowing to be implemented at the same time and across the full range of subjects and teaching and learning strands we have identified. We also feel it will have a bigger impact on staff allowing them to engage in the project as a team member. The aim will be to follow up this project with further ones to tackle issues that we as a school identify moving forward.We would aim to share and disseminate our results at a school level but we feel that such is the issue of disadvantaged students underachieving that we would also aim to relay our findings at a regional and even national level. This would take the form of CPD sessions ran by the staff and we would create a guide to be shared via etwinning at EU level.

We recently introduced a separate class for students who do not yet speak much German but are expected to reach Grammar school level. Most of them are refugees, some are children of foreign university teachers who spend a short time in Tuebingen. \r\nEach year, several students have to leave the school due to failure to meet academic standards. Teaching classes can be very challenging as we often do not set students tasks at different levels of difficulty according to their ability.\r\nThis is why we launched our first Erasmus+-KA1 last year, involving job-shadowing at St. John's School in Bishop Auckland in North-East England. The aim was to learn more about inner differentiation. We were overwhelmed by the professional approach to  streaming in the classroom that was not only well-developed but also practised in every class we saw. Although we had already profited from the inspiration and the practical material we received, we agreed that we wanted to observe these features in more detail. At the same time, there was another thing that struck us: How do the teachers manage to get the students to start work immediately and to behave so well? This is something we want to find out and learn to do ourselves. This is why we have applied for another KA1 to build on the first one: We want to job-shadow again in England in two groups of five teachers, with a larger interval in between in order to properly evaluate and build on the first experience. Out goal is to learn from a European partner school and profit from their knowledge and experience.\r\nTo provide our efforts with a scientific basis, we have already started cooperation with the Tuebingen School of Education, a newly-founded university department.\r\nIn addition to the first KA1, we have now included  a second partner, Colegio Hijas de Cristo Rey, in Oleiros in North-West Spain. We met teachers from that school in England because they job-shadowed at the same time. The discussions we had with them on various points of education and school systems made us keen to go to Spain to seek inspiration from the methods and structures that apply there. We could thus gain a different view on our system and identify improvements to implement in our curriculum.\r\nFurthermore, this offers an opportunity to involve the department of Spanish in our school,  in addition to the department of English. We are planning to visit Colegio Hijas de Cristo Rey, with six colleagues, in a third phase of the process, re-evaluating what we have learned by then.\r\nAs teachers in Germany always teach two or three different subjects, many other departments will be involved, such as history , biology, German and RE. \r\nWe also make sure that teachers who do not teach either English or Spanish are able to participate.\r\nIn addition, we are  planning to take courses that support our focus. One of the purposes is to accomodate colleagues who prefer structured courses over job-shadowing or who are afraid of language difficulties.\r\nOur school is familiar with different methods of teaching, including cooperative forms, job-shadowing with a tandem partner and feedback. Therefore, we expect our staff to use their new knowledge and experience in their own work in the classroom and to share with colleagues as widely as possible.\r\nUltimately, we expect inner differentiation / streaming to be used across the entire school with a positive impact on the learning atmosphere.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA101-035365_1"], ["6JT", "European Continuing Development Programme", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", 30432.0, "To bring about transformational change via teaching and learning we will identify subject areas and members of staff; selected specifically where not only is teaching considered outstanding, but where there is also there is a willingness to explore innovative and different teaching and learning styles.\r\nThrough our project of job shadowing and participation in structured courses we work with staff from each department in Spain, Germany and Hungary and to look at what works for them and how we can implement similar rationale with our students\r\n\r\nWe will :\r\n *Examine approaches to differentiated teaching and learning which supports underachievers;\r\n*Study ways to engage students to become more independent learners and how to tackle the setting and completion of quality homework tasks\r\n* Build home school relationships and understand how improved links can support achievement.\r\n\r\nThe close co-operation with other European schools will further develop our well-established work with our partners in Galicia, Spain, Tuebingen Germany and Szolnok ,Hungary who have a different and innovative approach to each of our principal school development issues\r\n\r\nThe findings of our project team will then be shared with the whole school staff and lead practitioners will trial and test innovative practice before assessing the fit with St John's need and ultimately adopting new approaches to classroom teaching and learning models. \r\nParticipation in this programmme will help the school to further develop its profile as a centre for internatioanl education co-operation and as a beacon school for innovative and reflective practice.", "http://www.stjohnsrc.org.uk", "St. John's Secondary School and Sixth Form College, A Catholic Academy, Bishop Auckland", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035412_coordinator"], ["6JZ", "German Architecture, Carpentry, and Culture", "Bishop Auckland College", 56568.0, "The Erasmus German Architecture, Carpentry, and Culture Project is designed to transfer knowledge and skills of German building construction techniques to the staff and students of Bishop Auckland College, in order that we can expand our delivery of the range of these skills, which are used to create energy efficient buildings and which are currently emerging in use in the UK.
