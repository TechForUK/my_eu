In addition tools will need to be developed to inform decision makers about the economic and environmental consequences of different intervention options being considered.\nMAINLINE proposes to address all these issues through a series of linked work packages that will target at least \u20ac300m per year savings across Europe with a reduced environmental footprint in terms of embodied carbon and other environmental benefits. It will:\n- Apply new technologies to extend the life of elderly infrastructure\n- Improve degradation and structural models to develop more realistic life cycle cost and safety models\n- Investigate new construction methods for the replacement of obsolete infrastructure\n- Investigate monitoring techniques to complement or replace existing examination techniques\n- Develop management tools to assess whole life environmental and economic impact.\nThe consortium includes leading railways, contractors, consultants and researchers from across Europe, including from both Eastern Europe and the emerging economies. Partners also bring experience on approaches used in other industry sectors which have relevance to the rail sector.\nProject benefits will come from keeping existing infrastructure safely in service through the application of technologies and interventions based on life cycle considerations.

We focus on youth organisations working with marginalised youth, NEETs or young people threatened by unemployment and social exclusion. During our events we connect them to capacity building organisations that provide training and networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nOur needs analysis with partner organisations showed that in order to put the abovementioned recommendations into practice, we should develop a training programme tackling the following fields of action: \r\n\u2022 Boost the self-confidence of youth workers and young people to dare more to put their ideas into practice (attitude),\r\n\u2022 Improve the operative knowledge on the structures, policies and mechanisms - especially as regards European youth participation (knowledge) - and making results tangible through social impact measurement (skills),\r\n\u2022 Coach participants to follow through upon their ideas over time (action).\r\n\r\nIn short we ask one question only: \"Who do YOU dare to be and which IMPACT do you want to stand for?\"\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS, ACTIVITIES,  METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS\r\nThe Arc Training assembles 32 youth workers, volunteers and young (aspiring) social entrepreneurs from 12 countries and 19 different organisations.

It also comprises a voluntary peer-to-peer post-coaching process lasting over a period of 6 months. \r\n\r\nOur methodology is rooted in the principles of non-formal education: Participants will be trained on the structures and mechanisms of European youth work. They will also be guided through a comprehensive coaching process where they will be given the opportunity to challenge their projects and develop an inspiring target which they are enthusiastic about reaching in the future. Towards the end of the training course a session on social impact measurement will empower them to add a quantitative dimension to the goal they wish to pursue. During the post-coaching process after the training, participants will not only be coached on realising their target, but to also on how to track their impact as a means for further internal improvement. \r\n\r\nWith The Arc Training we strive for the following impact as regards our participants: (a) increase in leadership skills, (b) increase in knowledge on EU structured and social impact measurement, (c) shift in attitude towards an outcome-oriented project management style, (d) an empowering experience of reaching an inspiring new goal for their project together with their coach. \r\nIn the long run the key competences developed during this process are also expected to increase their own employability and to significantly improve the work in their organisations at home.", "http://www.wpifoundation.org", null, "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA105-001536_16"], ["2AZ", "\"Peace is....\" - training course on aspects of peace and non-violence", "World Peace Initiative Ltd", 24279.0, "\"Peace is....\"- training course on aspects of peace and non-violence is an international project gathering youth workers from 17 conflict affected communities across Europe.  36 young activists will meet to explore the concept of culture of peace and learn techniques of non-violence.

All young people who are or become involved in the Erasmus+ programme develop their skills as perfect future youth leaders. Project Peace Leaders+ is based on the belief that group leaders of youth are able to increase the quality of Erasmus+ youth exchanges by finding appropriate models to motivate youth to actively participate in the youth exchange and thus gain new skills and knowledge. The main idea is to find this form of motivation where the group leader is not a teacher or superior but instead plays an active role of a facilitator who knows how to successfully involve and motivate youngsters. Following this model, the people assisting youngsters during international projects are helping, step by step, to also achieve the aims of the European Union and its values. \r\n\r\nThe training course has been designed based on the actual needs of the partners after several previous discussions and previous cooperation. Too often youth workers use the same methods in their work and this influences the quality and progress of any youth exchange. Therefore we see the need to improve and also assist the improvement of other youth leaders. The projects aims to assist and help current or future group leaders to develop their competences and become more active in the field of international youth work. We suggest to promote and facilitate an active approach which will help youth leaders to come up with good ideas and find new appropriate models to motivate youth, provide appropriate learning support, to stimulate young people\u2019s spirit of initiative, creativity and entrepreneurship. It will show the youth leaders how to improve their strategies for motivating youngsters and through their self-evaluation find new ways and methods for future projects.  Participants of the training course will have an opportunity to create appropriate models aimed at involving youngsters to initiate work and be proactive in their communities by themselves. We aim to achieve it by bringing back the youth leader to his first steps and facilitate their self-assessment as a group leader. By using interactive and non-formal methods (brainstorming, group works, simulation, role play, open group discussion, open space for reflection etc), the participants will become highly involved in the project and will develop their leadership skills and practical knowledge. The exact methods used will be adapted by the trainers based on the selected participants\u00b4 profiles to guarantee successful learning process of each participants. All participants will be also actively involved in all aspect of the project by preparing their country realities for situation of youth exchanges and facilitation in their organisations. \r\n\r\nThe project Peace Leaders+ will have a clear and effective impact on the partner organizations who will be involved in the project. The participating network of organizations has the aim to develop skills and knowledge of participants from different countries, open their mind and give them a chance to discuss issues that really affect them and their youth work.  Since the group leaders are prepared to work within an international environment it is also important to give them an international environment to apply their skills. Therefore project seeks to not only improve the qualities of future youth exchanges but also has the aim to provide a platform for facilitating cooperation between organizations and their networks.

At the same time, it is the young generation who will have to address and adapt to the unfolding consequences in the future. To empower these youngsters and facilitate a mental shift in their lives we count on a tool that has always been there for us, though in recent times we have relied less and less on it: we are talking about nature. Our connection with nature plays a major role in the quest of getting closer to our inner being, to our core. In order to create a positive change in our lifestyle without losing quality of life, we intend to bring participants back to their essence of who they really are, diving into their personal and inner life;  nature will be a part of this journey.\r\n\r\nThe target group of this training course are 24 youth workers, project leaders or educators, including anyone who is actively involved in youth work. With this training course we create a space for personal development in connection with nature through reflection on our concerns and passions as well as becoming more conscious of our personal learning process. We believe that gaining a deeper understanding of who we are and what we can do for others is an empowering process which can lead to positive changes for the future of society. Moreover it is necessary that youth workers know how they can support young people in facing their own challenges and thereby continue to grow as a person. After the training, participants are expected to adopt a multiplier role: they will lead young people in their home organisations and communities through a personal learning journey to craft and find powerful and meaningful responses to the challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are:\r\n- To raise awareness of our identity through reflecting on our challenges, concerns, talents and passions.\r\n- To stimulate the creativity, vulnerability, confidence and resilience of the participants.\r\n- To explore alternative ways of living, in particular the exchange with nature, which gives us a new quality of life.\r\n- To develop a different Mindset, based on the values: mind, heart, body and environment, which serves us in our future.\r\n- To encourage and serve the participants in planning their learning process also after the training course and also implement with their own target groups: young persons in their organization and community.\r\n- To learn more about the Erasmus+ program and its actions, and Youth Pass as a tool of recognition of the key competences.\r\n\r\nThis training course will be based on non-formal and informal education with a self-directed learning approach. That means that the participants are responsible for their own learning and the facilitators provide activities and guide the participants through their own learning process. The training course will be characterised by highly participatory, interactive and experiential methods. The activities will include case studies, working in pairs and small groups, meditations, contemplations, team building activities, role plays (Theatre of Oppressed), outdoor education, discussions, and self-assessment. Some sessions will be completed by theoretical inputs and all of them will be followed by group reflection or self-reflection.\r\n\r\nThe main direct dissemination will be a good action from every participants after he/she returned back home and put the things he/she learned in practise. The participant can enrich their environment, in particular their organisation, because these \u2018good actions\u2019 will be inspired by the needs which were mentioned by the partners before the application of the project. The good actions are one of the evaluation tools and will be a part of the final report. \r\n\r\nAlready during the project the evaluation process will play an essential role in the learning process. Participants will meet everyday to discuss the progress of learning as well as group integration and group dynamics.
