This global problem could be solved only by increasing number of beekeepers. The trouble is that today\u00b4s young people are not attracted enough to be beekeepers so it is very difficult to get them to do this activity. For this reason the group of young beekeepers from the Czech non-profit association V\u010cEL\u00cd STR\u00c1\u017d created the project called ROJEN\u00cd-SWARMING in which they try to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThe whole world, the European Union as well as the Czech Republic deals with the growing problem of irreplaceable loss of plant pollinators such as bees.

Approximately ten-member groups of young people from ten countries (the Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Poland, Germany, Romania, Wales, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Finland and the Netherlands) will be actively involved in the project. Each of these participating countries was chosen because of their unique and valuable experience.\r\n\r\nWithin the bounds of the project there will be created a comprehensive set of essential outcomes. On the one hand the outcomes will deal with innovative approaches to non-formal education of young people in beekeeping (e.g. e-learning course YOUNG BEEKEEPERS) and on the other hand with long-term and permanently sustainable methods and ways of international cooperation of young people \u2013 young beekeepers (e.g. methodical instructions about how to work as a young beekeeper or manual on international cooperation). To create these documents and to achieve goals of this project we will hold two seminars in Prague as well as project meetings of the managers of beekeeping organizations which will be held in Germany and Czech Republic activities focused on checking up on the project in beekeepers\u00b4own backyard, international conferences and other events. The project will participate in several activities that are not supported financially by the EU, but will serve to achieve its mission or checking up on the project essential outcomes. There are also for example two national meetings of the beekeeper youth clubs in the Czech Republic and three national seminars of the Czech beekeeping youth leaders and two years of national beekeeping knowledge competition- GOLDEN BEE.\r\n\r\nThe admission to these project activities was able on many years base of cooperation with project implementers and the central committee for work with the youth of the Czech Beekeeper Union.", "http://www.scbeekeepers.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-CZ01-KA205-014071_4"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["9AZ", "TRAC 11-24 East Wales", "Denbighshire County Borough Council", "Helping improve the career and life prospects of young people who are at risk of disengaging and falling out of education and training.", "ESF", 4015776.0, 8031552.0, "esf_wales_80753"], ["9AZ", "TRAC 11-24 West", "Denbighshire County Borough Council", "Helping improve the career and life prospects of young people who are at risk of disengaging and falling out of education and training.", "ESF", 17006512.0, 24647114.0, "esf_wales_80752"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LL15"}
