Remote sensing (RS) data at a range of scales from proximal observations to global extent sampling can detect essential changes in plant traits (PTs), biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, providing a method for scaling-up. However there are still methodological and technical constraints that hamper a systematic incorporation of RS in ecosystem models, including scalability and multi-source data integration issues. TRuStEE will train a new generation of scientists with complementary and interdisciplinary skills in ecosystem modelling, plant physiology, RS technologies and big data analysis, addressing the specific objectives: 1) to identify essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) and the link with PTs and ecosystem functional properties (EFPs), inferable from RS, 2) to investigate a completely new avenue for assessing vegetation photosynthetic efficiency from RS measurements of canopy fluorescence, 3) to assimilate diverse RS data streams with varying spatial and temporal resolution in dynamic ecosystem models and 4) to exploit new satellite missions (e.g. ESA-FLEX, ESA-Sentinels, NASA-GEDI) and EO products for the upscaling of PTs, EBVs and EFPs. The early stage researchers (ESRs) involved will strongly benefit from the network of internationally recognized scientists and private companies with relevant expertise in these topics.

At present different techniques are needed to inspect the ballast, track substructure and tunnels. TRACKSCAN would undertake these activities and more through non-invasive inspection. Within Europe ballast inspection requires digging a trench or driving plastic lined steel tubes into ballast with a pneumatic hammer. This is obviously impractical, time consuming, labour intensive and can miss ballast fouling. TRACKSCAN inspects all ballast so that maintenance can be targeted and effective. The feasibility study proposed intends to verify the technological and practical aspects of the system and ensure the business concept is sound. The system is described in terms of what can be achieved the science behind it is retained as confidential, as permitted by the call. The penetrating radar system has a rotating antenna which allows 360 degrees inspection and in any plane, this means that unlike other ballast inspection systems in the US, the TRACKSCAN system can extend beyond the vehicle width. The TRACKSCAN system is innovative, unique and we believe has a large market potential. The areas of inspection include: ballast; sub-ballast including drainage systems; water pipes and utilities, tunnel linings and tunnel track systems and bridge surface structures.\nThere is already interest from infrastructure owners and maintenance organisations such as Turkish Railways (TCDD) who have indicated their support as potential user/customers and will identify their needs and define the future work within Phase 2.

These materials are a route to further exploiting advanced materials, using enabling technologies for additional functionalities, without compromising structural integrity.
