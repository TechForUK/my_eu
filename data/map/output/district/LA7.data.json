These schools have cooperated for many years in different networks. Lerum Adult Education, and more specifically their apprentice program for blacksmiths, was invited to the consortium to give new perspective on validation of knowledge obtained at an internship, something which also initiated a cooperation concerning ECVET with our foreign partner organizations. A common trait for all partner organizations is the specific vocational competence they can contribute with \u2013 a trait that enhances the quality of the education we offer our students/apprentices. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the consortium is to give the participants of our Erasmus+ project the extra dimension that internship/job shadowing abroad can bring. We expect our students to strengthen their vocational skills, vocational identity, language knowledge and understanding of cultural differences and similarities between countries and organizations. As a whole, this will contribute to making our students more attractive as future employees. We expect our staff to further develop their ability to identify different competence levels regarding vocational skills, to enhance quality regarding internship and to learn more about digitalization. All this to improve the results of our students and to contribute to the development of our schools, the industrial society and society as a whole. Mainly, our European Development Plan is about making the students see Europe as ONE employment market. The schools of the consortium will influence the development in society by attracting more young people to technical vocational programs since our focus towards the industry of the future will contribute to enhanced competiveness. \r\n\r\nWithin the project, 219 mobilities will take place. Out of these, 184 mobilities are for upper secondary students at the Industrial technology program, Electricity program and the Technology program, 15 mobilities are for handicraft apprentices and 20 mobilities are for school staff and/or supersvisors at the companies. Generally, students and staff from all schools are required to apply for participation in the project and they will be accepted as long as they are vocationally skilled and are good representatives for their schools, the companies, Erasmus+ and Sweden. An extra requirement for students and apprentices is that they have fulfilled previous internships in Sweden with a satisfactory result. All schools use Learning Agreements to ensure high standards, and Learning Outcomes are documented in the Europass Mobility Document. The OLS language test and the web-based language courses are used to make sure the students/apprentices have linguistic abilities to be able to benefit from their internships. Grant Agreements are established so that the students are in control of their budget. The apprentices at Lerum Adult Education, are given a greater responsibility for their international internship regarding their budget as well as initiating contacts and communicating with their supervisors to be. \r\n\r\nExpected impact and learning outcomes for teachers, supervisors and organizations, are an increased understanding of the production and processes at plants/work places in other countries, a greater understanding of how to use ECVET for validation of knowledge and competences within vocational courses, an improved and quality assured process for internship and an extended network in Europe. Expected impact and learning outcomes for students and apprentices is mainly greater employability due to enhanced vocational skills, stronger vocational identity, improved language skills, a larger understanding of the connection between technical development and the development of a more sustainable society \u2013 ecologically, economically and socially.  Everything to raise the students/apprentices interest concerning future work in Europe.\r\n\r\nEvery school spreads results from the project at their websites, educational fairs and open houses for potential students and their parents. An idea is to give some students the opportunity to create a film that can be used for these purposes. The apprentices from Lerum Adult Education partake in various handicraft competitions and fairs in order to spread knowledge and experiences. The different parts of the project will be presented at staff meetings and contribute to organizational development. In the Technical College network the consortium will reach other technology companies and these companies are also invited to the conference \u201cGr\u00e4nsl\u00f6st l\u00e4rande\u201d at the World Cultural Museum. This conference is arranged in Gothenburg every year by the consortium. The aim of the conference is to spread the knowledge of how internationalization and Erasmus+ can improve vocational education and the competence for students/apprentices in order to make them more attractive for the European Employment Market.", "http://www.billerudkorsnas.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA102-034353_17"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA7"}
