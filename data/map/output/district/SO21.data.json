In certain cases, a blade is dismantled and transported onshore, making the turbine downtime very high.\n\nThe AUTOWINSPEC project will provide a system to automatically estimate the condition and remaining lifespan of the blades, by eliminating dangerous rope access and reducing downtime whilst increasing productivity.\n\nThe inspection involves the following steps:\n- An autonomous robotic system crawls along the blade.\n- Using novel Acousto-Ultrasonic NDE technique the condition of the blades is estimated.\n- The NDT equipment is applied through probes based on a gimbal structure to perform the inspection as a continuous spot measurement process to cover the blades.\n- The coordinates and respective measurements are stored and through novel signal analysis techniques a map of the mechanical properties of the blades is produced pinpointing defects and estimating the remaining life of the entire blade.\n\nThe AUTOWINSPEC system aims for a target reduction of 84% in maintenance costs, since the inspection process will be completed in half time compared to current practice eliminating the need for trained operators. By including the reduction of revenue loss through increased downtime, overall savings can be greater.

The inspection system provides a rapid, high-resolution non-contact means of reliably inspecting composite wind turbine plates for surface and subsurface defects. A robotic manipulation system \u2014 designed to withstand strong winds \u2014 can carry and deploy the integrated digital shearography system on the wind tower. The robotic platform and the shearography system are controlled by an inspection operator on the ground, thus eliminating the danger of working at a height.\n\nScientists developed a software package for remote control of the whole system, data acquisition and transfer, image processing, results interpretation and information storage. Furthermore, they developed comprehensive algorithms and procedures for phase extraction from shearography fringe patterns and for compensating the WTB rigid body motion during inspection.\n\nDASHWIN represents the first time a shearography system will be used for inspecting WTBs. It should improve the detection of cracks, disbanding, delamination and other defects in the composite material with which turbine blades are constructed. This will help reduce the likelihood of mechanical failure, thereby preventing costly repairs, lost revenue and even possible human casualties.\n\nThe DASHWIN system was tested at the field of an operating wind turbine in Greece, demonstrating the capability of the system. Except for WTB inspection, the system can find wide application in other sectors that can benefit from gaining an accurate picture of large-surface areas.
