Permaculture is growing globally and in Denmark and has prompted an increase in demand on education and services. \r\n\r\nThe human resourcebase in Denmark is limited and new knowledge and educational methods are sought in Europa. A previous jobshadowing and capacity building activity has already been fruitful in combination with a Leonardo da Vinci partnership on \"Sustainable Ways of Teaching\". The Danish adoption of the \"Learning and Network Demonstration\" (LAND) project is a direct benefit of the cooperation with especially Permaculture Association UK. The concept of LAND projects will be implemented in several European countries and thus provide a growing learning community of permaculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Adult Staff mobilities project is to build capacity in Denmark, with a view to fulfilling the growing demand for permaculture services and education. Permaculture is a holistic design science built on ethics and principles focusing on taking care of nature, people and a fair share of resources. With this point of departure and understanding of the educator's role, learning and training in all sustainable and regenerative practices from nuts as a niche production to transition of local communities is performed. Especially marginal areas and local communities can benefit from permaculture and as a source of renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 educators, 2 board members and 1 project coordinator will participate in the Adult Staff mobilities project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 educators are associated with a LAND centre on Fej\u00f8/Lolland and have their background in local transition and entrepreneurship. The Baltic cooperation is very present in their local community and they look to the east towards the local eco-village found along the shores of the Baltic Sea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther 2 educators wish to visit Germany on a combined permaculture and eco-village design education course. The integration of these two approaches is a strong combination which can be used in for example the cooperation with municipalities that wish to develop more eco-villages and sustainable local communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 educators concentrate on forest gardening and production of nuts which is a sustainable and carbon storing alternative to conventional agriculture. 1 educator wish a longer stay as an intern working with forest gardening and Permculture Design Certificate courses, Open College Network accredited. Both activities will take place in the UK which is has the most developed permaculture educational system in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 student of permaculture wishes to take his Permaculture Design Certificate in Sweden with one of the most active and innovative permaculture educators in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 English teacher will join to teach a course on \"Social Permaculture\" focussing on Action Learning and awareness of competences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe building of capacity will strengthen education in permaculture and teachers' empowerment. It will primarily be integrated through the LAND network. LAND centres are training and education places centering on pratical application and real life sustenance, typically located in marginal areas - the islands Fej\u00f8, Bornholm, \u00c6r\u00f8, Sams\u00f8 and Northern Jutland. However, there are also locations in and near Copenhagen. The LAND centres organises training, courses and tours etc and they play a pivotal role in the local networks. They are publically available and spread knowledge about sustainable solutions and local entrepreneurship. They counteract centralisation and unemployment and they strengthen responsability towards local resources, both human, economic and environmental. This approach to marginal areas can give new life and regeneration which in the long term can stimulate societal development at large.\r\n\r\nThe collated experience of this capacity building project can be integrated in the European cooperation and inspire countries that also experience a  growth in permaculture.

We want to become bigger to ensure a better provision of educaiton, both courses and the diploma in applied permaculture design. We would like to have the capacity to ensure quality of teachers and courses. We also need to be more visible nationally and internationally to increase the demand for our teachers and courses.2) Decentral locations - learning at demonstration sitesMost of the educational activities take place at the LAND centres. We wish to strengthen the LAND centres on three levels; In relation to their costumers and local communities; in relation to the national network with other LAND centres for exchange of materials and esperiences and more; In realtion to the network internationally for strengthening of job opportunities, quality of the educational activities and inspiration to the livelihoods of the LAND centres. 3) Different people - different competence developmentPermaculture educators have different backgrounds and therefore different needs for training and adult learning to be able to fill out their roles. 4) On site learning and development of coursesLAND centres offer on site learning and demonstration of real living examples.

This year the focus is on upgrading the ability to teach on the basic course - Permaculture Design Course (PDC) - which is an \"entrance ticket\" to permaculture, but also a bottleneck when there are shortages of qualified teachers in relation to demand.\r\n\r\nWith the training of teachers in different educational situations like job shadowing, training of teachers and teaching on real courses, it is possible for a lift of the present teachers while giving new teachers skills and opportunities. This means for teachers:\r\n- Improving the capacity to organize specialized and relevant courses and other training\r\n- Better quality and outreach of the teachers who have participated in international educational context and facilitation\r\n- More diversified education and larger scope of teaching\r\n- Better financial sustainability\r\n- Enhanced European and global network.\r\n\r\nQuality assurance of teaching and better European project management is another area of focus for this project. Building these skills in the association will have a direct impact on the efficiency of administrators to manage both the increasing demand for education in permaculture and also the association's collaboration with organizations at European level.\r\n\r\nThe research cooperation at European level is a promising, innovative approach which involves educators and practitioners in Citizen Science through the collection of data about for example climate adaptation. The expansion of the action learning methodology, already used in the design-oriented education and diploma system is also a foreseen effect of the Citizen Science approach.\r\n\r\nAll in all, people interested in permaculture in Denmark gains easier access to education in permaculture with higher quality, greater diversity and more options.

Permaculture, a powerful tool for ecological resource building and for societal integration and citizenship practice, needs to be practiced not just by the landed, but also by the landless \u2013 students, school children, youth, apartment-dwellers, itinerant travelers, migrants, those suffering forced displacement and social exclusion.\r\n\r\nWe have made some strides towards these goals.  But we need to do more. We need more substantial improvement in the breadth and depth of our permaculture knowledge, be better equipped to be able to think about permaculture in new ways and apply it in untried contexts and thus better reach new and marginalized groups.  We need exposure to permaculture practices in other societal contexts, through experience-exchange at permaculture-rich international gatherings, through immersion in advanced courses not available in Sweden, and through contact with practictioners in countries with a more developed permaculture practice.  We need to improve our organizational and administrative capacity, including our capacity to run and promote our diploma system for training new permaculture teachers. \r\n\r\nOur objectives summarized thus are:\r\n1. To more successfully adapt traditional permaculture to a contemporary Swedish context, one that can adequately respond to modern-day local challenges, such as the need for greater social inclusion and more active citizenship, as well as to international challenges such as migration, forced displacement, and global climate change.  \r\n2. To build a greater capacity for our permaculture teachers for their pedagogical work and for their practical work as creative-problems solvers for permaculture practice in untried contexts.\r\n3. To build our organizations capacity to improve the quality and accessibility of our courses, including continued improvements of the Nordic diploma system for permaculture.\r\n4. To build more and closer international cooperation and networks both for our organization and for our teachers and teachers in training \r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nOur administrator, who will help run the project, will select Diploma holding permaculture teachers, teachers in training, board members, and others involved in our administrative work with the nordic diploma system and our international contacts to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nWe apply for support for: \r\n1. Training of Teachers (ToT) course in England for permaculture teachers.\r\n2. Participation at the European Permaculture Convergence in Ireland.\r\n3. Ecovillage Design Education - Design for Sustainability course at Findhorn in Scotland\r\n4. Participation at the Permaculture Diploma Gathering in England\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nWe will use Europass Mobility to evaluate and document learning goals and results for each of our mobilities and each of our participants. The administrator will also actively engage with participants and partner organizations both before and after each mobility, to make sure they are well prepared, and that all goes well during the courses or events. The information gotten through the Europass mobiliity document, in addition to the information we get in direct communication with each participant will give us a more complete picture of their experience and learning from the mobility, that will then be shared through blog posts on the association home page, through articles in the nordic permaculture magazine, with the partner organisations for their work evaluating their course or event. Results will also be summarized and shared through EPALEs open library, and at fairs and events.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nThe additional capacity of our permaculture teachers will lead to a diversified range of courses and creative solutions that tailor permaculture to a contemporary Swedish context, including greater accessibility for previously marginalized groups.\r\nThe training and exposure to England's developed diploma system will lead to an improvement in our Nordic diploma system for permaculture, in particular for our Swedish diploma system tutors and tutees. \r\nOur more developed international contact network will increase the bilateral flow of activities and teacher exchange to and from Sweden, also benefiting European permaculture practice at large.\r\nThe possibility that other countries will turn to Sweden for models of contemporary permaculture practice will increase", "http://www.permaculture.org.uk ", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA104-038993_2"], ["3BP", "Kapacitetsopbygning af permakultur i Danmark 2018", "PERMACULTURE ASSOCIATION (BRITAIN)LBG", 23057.0, "Background:\r\nPermaculture Denmark memberships are ever-increasing, and so are the challenges we face in relation to systems and resources, in particular for better quality-control of courses, teaching and teachers.\r\n\r\nThe Permaculture design certificate course, (the PDC) is a required qualification if you are to begin with the diploma in applied permaculture design (which composes of a minimum of 2 years experience and self-motivated study.)\r\nCurrently, there are only three active diploma holders that offer the PDC course, with a capacity for 40 students per year. These diploma holders also supervise teaching on other PDC courses, where the course-holders themselves have not yet completed their diplomas and been certified. Permaculture Denmark aims to improve this situation, by certifying more qualified teachers at diploma level.\r\n\r\nThe diploma system has traditionally been governed by the three Nordic permaculture associations. The system is still not up-to-date and needs clear learning outcomes, especially since permaculture has been greatly developed in the last few decades. The English system is thoroughly thought-out and much further developed than the Nordic system. We are seeing a rise in the number of diploma students in Scandinavia, who take their diploma with the British Permaculture Association as the qualifying body. Permaculture Denmark would like to integrate the best-practices from the two diploma systems into the Nordic cooperation, but this task is not without its challenges. As a result we are experiencing a bottle-neck effect, where not enough certified courses are offered to meet the demand.\r\n\r\nPermaculture is a holistic design system, that addresses all areas of human needs, but there is a particular importance placed on caring for the earth, caring for people and a fair sharing of resources. This is permaculture\u2019s ethical foundation. The word permaculture comes from \u201cpermanent culture\u201d, and \u201cpermanent agriculture\u201d. The permaculture movement is rapidly growing all over the world; and is a reaction to climate-change, pollution, economic crisis and increasing global pressure on food-production and biodiversity. The LAND network (Learning, Activities, Network and Demonstration sites for permaculture) has been created to meet the need for practical demonstration of permaculture and give course participants the opportunity to combine theory with hands-on learning.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nPermaculture Denmark wishes in particular to educate more permaculturists to meet the growing demand for permaculture courses. This education will take place through: \r\n- Training of new teachers\u2019 professionalism and/or didactic skills; \r\n- Continued development of the diploma system; \r\n- Quality control of certified courses; \r\n- Increased number of diploma holders; \r\n- Development of the LAND network in the Nordic and Baltic countries.\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\nWe expect that the cooperation with the English association and the associated course providers, as well as the Nordic permaculture associations will continue to heighten the quality of the Danish teachers and their teaching. This project will offer: \r\n- New technical/professional knowledge to 2 teachers;\r\n- New pedagogical competences to 6 teachers, through training of teachers and job-shadowing;\r\n- Perspective and professionalism through Diploma Gatherings to at least 5 diploma students;\r\n- Increased cooperation of European countries, and the opportunity for the collective creation of courses and job opportunities with other permaculture associations through the European Permaculture Convergence;\r\n- Improved qualifications for new teachers and the strengthening of the LAND network around the Baltic sea by holding a teacher training course in Finland.\r\n\r\nLong-term results: \r\nThe technical knowledge brought home, is one part of our plan to demonstrate a truly sustainable and profitable alternative to modern farming. The course provider we have chosen, Ridgedale Farm in Sweden, is possibly the most successful in Europe in relation to economical, ecological and social sustainability. Every year we send a few students to Ridgedale, in order to support the practical and theoretical use of regenerative farming and permaculture.\r\n\r\nOur focus on development of the diploma system and our focus on the training of teachers will greatly streamline our organisations education system and will mean a greater capacity and quality overall. At the same time the basis for a productive European cooperation with greater mobility of teachers and a nuanced and sufficient array of courses, education, practical experiences, demonstration sites and strong organisations, that can offer sustainable solutions in the climate crisis.\r\n\r\nWe do our best to increase the capacity of the Baltic organisations.

Youth in Permaculture is a new network which is sprouting among young people (age 13-30). It\u2019s aims is to engage youth, parents and youth educators to use the holistic design system of permaculture. We would like to involve other youth in this process also and give chance for the youth of tomorrow to create together.\r\n\r\nOur mobility project aims to developing important competences such as changing  participants\u2019 behaviour in relation with nature, diversity, inclusion and community, improving intercultural cooperation and more conscious and critical thinking. More specifically, the activities that will be held during the exchange will make our participant groups more aware about how humans and the nature is inseparable elements and we need to cooperate in the society and with the nature for a permanent life. Activities that take place in sub-groups are expecting to improve skills such as decision-making and democratic lifestyle, because every subgroup will need to cooperate in order to achieve their given tasks in harmony. Also we raise awareness about rural lifestyle, and insipring youth with rural enterpreneurship opportunities by showing them examples, good examples inspired by permaculture.\r\n\r\nFor this reason we will develop different activities such as include presentations, workshops, artistic articulation, practical learning opportunities and study visits. Methods used are non-formal education methods that will include small and large group discussions, games, reflection groups, practical and interactive workshops. We will use sociocracy as a governing tool. \r\n\r\nThe local community will be highly involved in the activities and will help us achieving another objective, which is showing that rural areas can offer great job opportunities and entrepreneurship.\r\nIn fact, several examples located in surrounding Etyek will be visited, and  share their experience with participants, supporting them understanding how a rural area can be a land of opportunities if its resources are used wisely and with respect and young people are actively involved in development ideas and implementations. For youngsters facing with difficulties finding a job, learning about the effects on the local community can encourage them in becoming entrepreneur of such business as well.\r\nThis youth exchange will generate benefits also for the local community involved, as they will have a broader awareness of the good examples of sustainability and youth activism.", "http://www.permaculture.org.uk ", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HU01-KA105-047679_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LS5"}
