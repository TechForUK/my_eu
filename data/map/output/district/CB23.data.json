Chronic bacterial pulmonary infection leading to an irreversible decline in lung structure and function is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with CF, with more than 95% of deaths due to respiratory failure. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is the most frequently isolated pathogen, chronically infecting up to 80% of adult patients. When this occurs patients require lifelong inhaled antibiotic therapy, which although onerous to take, has been fundamental in increasing life expectancy by suppressing infection, reducing exacerbations and preserving lung function in CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Studies employing enhanced culture techniques and culture-independent molecular approaches have recently shown that the lungs of CF patients harbour diverse polymicrobial communities, the \u201cmicrobiome\u201d. Other Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (GNnF), including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and bacteria from the genera Burkholderia, Achromobacter, Acinetobacter, Ralstonia and Pandoraea may be present and contribute to disease. Moreover, Burkholderia cenocepacia is associated with rapid deterioration of lung function and poor clinical outcome.  \n\nEstimates for the prevalence of non-CF bronchiectasis (BE) range from 4 per 100 000 in young adults to nearly 300 per 100,000 in persons 75 years and older in developed countries. The number of adults is increasing significantly and the forecast is that the number of adults with CF will increase by 100% between 2010 and 2025. These individuals will mostly have chronic infection with Pa. \n\nIndividuals with BE have chronic cough and sputum production and frequent respiratory infections which lead to impaired lung function and health-related quality of life. Chronic infection with Pa affects 12\u201327% of adults with BE and is associated with an increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function, hospital admissions and increased mortality. There is a direct relationship between bacterial load, airway inflammation and risk of exacerbation supporting the use of long-term administration of inhaled antibiotics in BE. \n\nCurrently, a limited number of inhaled antimicrobials are available for use in CF with no antibiotics approved to treat lung infection in patients with BE. As median predicted survival of CF birth cohorts is now greater than 40 years, adherence to consensus treatment guidelines requires that chronically infected patients are treated for decades with inhaled antimicrobials. Furthermore, bacteria causing respiratory infection are becoming progressively more resistant to conventional antibiotics with up to 45% of CF patients colonised with multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. New antibiotics with activity against such respiratory pathogens are urgently needed.  \n\nThe iABC-consortium (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic fibrosis) brings together world leading collaborative researchers to develop new antibiotic treatment options for people with CF and BE by sharing expertise and resources. It involves about 20 public partners and 2 pharmaceutical companies in 6 countries and 4 pan-European networks: ECFS-CTN, CLIN-Net, LAB-Net and EMBARC. These networks inclide almost all European countries and will be used to recruit centres for the clinical trials. These groups combine experience and proven expertise and success in microbiology, antibiotic development, clinical trials, endpoints and patient registries. Their existing infrastructure provides an excellent basis for the successful achievement of the objectives of ND4BB Topic 7. \n\nThe iABC consortium will build on and add to existing research networks and infrastructures within the IMI ND4BB-program, thereby strengthening these networks for future research programs.

FLAME supports the combination of language learning with the learning of other school subjects.  \r\n\r\nIn the Comberton Academy Trust, we embrace the overarching aim of providing \u2018education with an international outlook\u2019.  In one of our four Trust schools, there is the opportunity to enhance our Spanish language curriculum and learner outcomes by introducing a FLAME programme for Y8, involving the teaching of maths, art, music and design technology through the medium of Spanish.  Experience in UK schools, as well as wider research in other European countries, has shown that students enjoy learning in this way and become more confident users of the language as a result.  Results show that students do as well or even better in the non-language subject, too.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that teachers are equipped to plan and deliver high-quality FLAME teaching, we recognise the need for both linguistic upskilling in Spanish as well as the development of pedagogical knowledge about content and language integrated learning.  We therefore undertook to train and develop 5 teachers to initiate the FLAME curriculum.  The teachers differ in the level of linguistic competence from none \u2013 A2, but all are interested in and open to the principles of FLAME teaching and committed to implementing it in our school.  \r\n\r\nThe mobilities involved are two-fold: firstly, a Spanish linguistic immersion course, involving a blend of language classes, MFL pedagogy modellling, immersion activities and etwinning preparation. As well as daily Spanish lessons and teaching sessions, there will be the opportunity to observe Spanish teaching in a local secondary school, meet Spanish teachers and gain a contact who can lend further support through e-twinning.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent job shadowing at our partner school will involve a mixture of subject specific lesson observation, and meetings with teacher \u2018partner\u2019 for discussion / planning / resource creation.  Following this, our partner Spanish teachers will return to us for a reciprocal job shadowing visit.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate that the outcomes will be extremely positive.  Having trained our staff, Spanish provision will improve through the introduction of a CLIL / FLAME programme for Y8 students (150 students).  Teachers will have the skills, expertise and confidence to deliver elements of their own specialist subjects in Spanish, including maths, art, design technology and music.  This will, in turn, generate improved outcomes in Spanish for its Y8 students.    In addition, we will have a model for FLAME teaching which, once thoroughly evaluated, can be shared widely: across our Trust schools; in our local Association for Language Learning network, online on the British Council website and others, and at national language teacher training events such as Language World.  In this way, we hope to contribute to the growing interest in CLIL/FLAME as a methodological approach and provide an action research case study of its use in UK and Spanish schools to add to the body of action research studies in this field.", "http://www.combertonvc.org", "Comberton Academy Trust", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002072_coordinator"], ["1JW", "LIVING LANGUAGES FOR HASLINGFIELD", "Haslingfield Endowed Primary School", 11226.0, "This will be a two-year project within which we would like six members of staff to take part in training courses in Spain. These members of staff will include teachers, TAs and HLTAs from both KS1 and KS2.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, we intend to make a fundamental change to the way we approach language teaching in our school. We believe that children learn better if they are taught Spanish by their own teachers and it is embedded into other curriculum areas and into daily routines and school life. We will move away from reliance on an external Spanish teacher, and will use the opportunity of this project to build the skills of our staff so that they are confident to take on the teaching role themselves. We will introduce languages into KS1 and Early Years. Our head teacher is our local cluster MFL leader. We would like Hasingfield to be a flagship school for teaching Spanish at primary level and need to ensure that our provision is outstanding. As languages are now a statutory requirement in KS2, it is also important for our school to strengthen the professional profile and future career prospects of our staff by allowing them to develop their skills, increasing their language competence and cultural knowledge. We also intend to introduce extra curricular provision of languages aimed at the wider community, including parents, and organise fun, cultural, Spanish events both within the school and in the wider community. \r\n\r\nWe need to give our pupils more language learning opportunities and an understanding of the importance and relevance of languages through developing cross curricular links and increasing the European dimension throughout school and link languages to literacy. We also need to look for new and innovative ways to use ICT within our language teaching.\r\n\r\nMost of our children have very little exposure to any form of foreign language. It is essential for our school to develop a link with the Spanish school and therefore develop a greater understanding of Spanish culture. We would like members of our staff to have the chance to spend time in the Spanish school, get to know Spanish colleagues, understand the school system and have the chance to observe practice. This would allow them to assimilate new ideas and strategies for teaching and to develop friendships which will lead to more successful implementation of joint projects.\r\n\r\nWe have identified immersion courses in Spain which involve a focus on intensive language learning, cultural development, language teaching methodology, innovative teaching ideas and the opportunity to engage in discussions relating to language learning in primary school. The courses also involve spending time in a Spanish primary school, working alongside staff, sharing ideas and good practice and building links for the future.\r\n\r\nBy taking part in these courses, participants will greatly increase their skills and confidence to teach language in their own class. They will also be confident to support other colleagues within our school and  integrate Spanish learning into our curriculum and into our daily routines. This will make language teaching more sustainable in our school and more effective as pupils will have it reinforced through the week. It will give language learning a greater status and show that it is valued. \r\n\r\nParticipants will have time in Spain to be able to gather a bank of effective and authentic resources to engage all pupils and will be able to observe practice in the Spanish school. \r\n\r\nWe will use ideas from the course to increase the use of ICT within our language teaching. \r\n\r\nBy having regular contact with Spanish pupils, they will understand much more about the lives of people in other countries and will see that there are many similarities with their own lives. Joint projects through eTwinning will be highly motivating for our pupils. They will increase their communication skills and have an audience and purpose for their work. This will help to raise their global awareness and future aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe resulting changes in other language teaching provision will mean that our school can deliver outstanding language teaching and become a flagship school within our area.\r\n\r\nDelivered by enthusiastic, confident staff, this exciting project will prepare us for discovering a higher level of cultural awareness.

Others in contrast have gained wiedespread experience with exchange schools, supervision of international work experiences or the preparation of students for the encounter with groups of partner instituations etc. The team evaluates the colleagues' curiosity and willingness to participate in the project as a very positive sign. Already a steady increase in interested colleagues to participate in the \"International Dimension\" team is very pleasant and leads to the assumption that interest in mobilities will continue to increase.

The participants cannot only serve actively as multipliers of results and experiences and have students partake in European exchange projects, but particularly the project shows students that even their teachers are still learners, that learning is a process that doesn't stop after graduating. They represent a positive role model because they eagerly work together with other people from all over Europe, because they keep expanding their experiences as teachers and share them with others.
