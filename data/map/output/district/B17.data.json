Students feel sense of empowerment when they manage abroad: they can use foreign language and they are understood, they learn to manage money. They learn basic everyday skills of life. Their self-esteem increases as the students are able to manage abroad, although not alone, but away from their families. The main theme of the project is to increase students\u00b4 not only professional skills and competences but also social and communication as well as life management skills. This is taken into account in every stage of the project. \r\nProject partners have been chosen for the mobility keeping in mind the acquisition of the key competences. Partners are colleges, companies or intermediate partners with contacts to local companies. All the mobilities are work related and the spare time are partly structured cultural activities. \r\nThe goal of the project is to involve many vocational study fields, especially technical fields, to mobilities and provide the mobility experience to students with special needs. The target groups of the project are students in following fields: Preparatory training,  nursing, media and communication, household and cleaning services, catering, business and administration, vehicle mechanic, . 2- week mobilities will be carried out as group mobilities with accompanying person(s). Accompanying person can provide support during the whole mobility period. Support offered by sending organization is extremely important in order to carry out successful mobilites. \r\nAll students attending to the mobilities have special education needs. Since the students are not chosen yet, we do not know exactly their special needs. However, it is more likely that the student have, for example, mental health problems, delayed development, disorders in language development, attention deficits, visual or hearing impairment or Asperger syndrome or autistic features or a combination of several disorders. Staff of the target groups\u00b4 educational fields are closely involved in the project: planning, implementing, participating and evaluating the mobilities. \r\n\r\nMobilities will be carried out in following study fields: \r\nPreparatory and rehabilitative training to Iceland, learning at the college\r\nSocial and Health care (Practical nurse) to Estonia, on the job learning in nursing home\r\nBusiness and Administration (Merkonomi) to Germany and to Italy, on the job leaning \r\nAudiovisual design (Media assistant) to Portugal, learning at the college and on the job learning\r\nHousehold services (Cleaning services) to HU, CZ  and England, college based studies and on the job learning in companies/in hosting organization \r\nVehicle Technology (Vehicle mechanic) to France, on the job learning in hosting organization \r\nProperty maintenance Operative to England, on the job learning in companies\r\nBusiness Information Technology to Gernany, on the job learning in companies\r\nCatering (cook) to France, on the job learning in hosting organization\r\n\r\n\r\nMobilties of Social and Health will be carried out care jointly with Kiipula and Keskuspuisto and mobility of customer service and sales together with Keskuspuisto and Validia. Other mobilities will be carried out by each consortium members. Project will be partly reciprocal as partners in Chech and in Portugal have applied reciprocal mobilities to Keskuspuisto. \r\nMobilties have significant role both personally and professionally for the beneficiaries. Students learn independence, develop social and communication skills, develop language skills and communication in foreign language and experience different cultures. Students improve professional competence when they learn new working methods, new policies and new tools. Students will see different ways of working and studying. Profession will open up in totally different way as the students see how the profession is being taught in other countries. This will improve the motivation of the students. Previous mobilities have shown that the students feel the sense of empowerment when they manage abroad. \r\nOn the national, European and/or international levels we aim at sharing our knowledge on vocational special needs education. We emphasize the fact that the students involved in mobility and other international projects do not need to be the top students but all the students despite their special need are entitled to gain the experience. We encourage our partners locally, regionally, nationally and on European and/or International level to involve also students with special needs in the implementation of various projects.", "http://www.qac.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FI01-KA102-008903_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B17"}
