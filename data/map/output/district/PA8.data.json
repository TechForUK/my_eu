The reality offers worrying statistics when it comes to assess immigrant students performance (lower than the figures for national classmates) and drop-out figures (over the national average in all the European countries). Linguistic adaptation is a central issue in the mentioned educational phases, that can contribute to improve not only the academic results but also social inclusion of immigrant students. However, it requires the design of appropriate environments and teachers prepared to meet the challenges that undoubtedly generates multilingualism. And those are the central targets of MULTI-ESKOLA project.In line with the Paris Declaration, we will implement actions aimed at addressing diversity in education and training (formal and informal, the development of social, civic and intercultural competences and media literacy, as well as fighting discrimination and segregation.MULTI-ESKOLA project clearly addresses the target group of teachers and, additionally to school and I-VET centres managers. The project focuses on the development of two strategic outputs that points to the priority of \"Strengthening the profile of the teaching professions\" as we will develop resources and educational materials aimed at improving the professional skills of the teachers of secondary schools and initial vocational training, promoting continuous and peer learning through the creation of specific environments that allow interaction between teachers, experts, the educational community in general, and representatives of parents, among others.MULTI-ESKOLA project is designed to respond to the challenges of multilingualism in educational centres focusing on:- The need of all the students to develop language competences both in mother tongue and in other language to facilitate their social and labor inclusion. - The development of trilingual educational models and excellence models that clearly respond to the current social and labour market demands.- The respect for the minority languages, official and non-official, that coexists in many European regions in educational (formal and informal) environments.The project main goal is to respond to the new challenges of European schools and i-VET centres by providing resources for the development of an inclusive education and training, from the perspective of multilingualism.The project specific objectives include:- To identify, analyze and propose schools and i-VET centres recommendations and guidelines for designing effective multilingual education programs.- To develop resources and educational materials aimed at improving the professional skills of the teachers of secondary schools and initial vocational training.- To promote continuous and peer learning through the creation of specific environments that allow interaction between teachers, experts, the educational community in general, and representatives of parents.Outlined needs are not country limited by common to all the EU countries, thus transnational approach is the best way to achieve quality outputs gathering multiple views and experiences to respond to a EU level issue.", "http://www.36and6.pl", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA201-025323_1"], ["7DJ", "Digital Training Toolbox to FosteR EU'S IndusTry 4.0 RevoluTion", "36.6 Competence Centre (Scotland)", 211305.0, "CONTEXT\r\nThe evolution of European industries is supported by digital solutions and is depicted in what is so-called \"Industry 4.0\". A survey conducted by the European Social Fund on the monitoring of professional needs of industry reveals a mismatch between demand and supply of skilled workforce. Businesses demand workers specialized in digital skills tailored for the industrial sector. It is necessary to introduce VET programs able to combine specialized sector expertise with a set of e-leadership and ICT skills.\r\nIndustry has been working closely with schools, universities, HEI providers to set up innovative programmes to supply people with key skills necessary for the digital transformation. Nevertheless, VET is yet to develop a link with the industrial sector. \r\n\r\nMAIN AIM\r\nInvolve the industrial sector in the transformation of VET systems, in order to meet the need of digital skills consistent with the technological developments in industries\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC OBJECTIVES\r\n\u2022 Investigate skill shortages in the 4.0 industry \r\n\u2022 Promote VET initiatives on digital skills targeting workers through mixed partnerships \r\n\u2022 Design training courses to update and requalify workers of the industrial sector, focusing on the uptake of digital skills \r\n\u2022 Foster training initiatives for entrepreneurs to make them understand the potential of ICT in traditional industries\r\n\u2022 Provide e-leadership skills to workers and managers that will lead to better employment and career opportunities \r\n\u2022 Foster the recognition of ICT skills in the traditional industrial sector through the use of ECVET \r\n\r\nTARGETS\r\n\u2022 60 workers of traditional industrial sectors\r\n\u2022 25 managers / entrepreneurs of traditional industrial sectors\r\n\u2022 250 stakeholders\r\n\u2022 11 VET trainers \r\n\u2022 8 organizations partners of the Consortium\r\n\u2022 24 staff members of the Consortium\r\n\u2022 12 supporting partners\r\n\u2022 Indirect: ca. 9.000 people\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGIES\r\nSKILLS-SET AND TRAINING TOOLBOX: Individual interviews, reviewing existing documents, discussions with SMEs\u2019 steering groups, discussions with relevant bodies. \r\nROUNDTABLES: informal interviews \r\nECVET PATH AND DIDACTIC MODEL: 36.6CC will create ECVET points relevant transfer system paths to be transferred to all partners. \r\nTRAINING TOOLBOX TEST AND SHORT TERM JOINT STAFF TRAINING ACTIVITY - Both courses will make use of several methods in addition to practical workshops and face to face lessons.

However, according to the EASPD Employment Declaration of December, 2014, people with disabilities are structurally disadvantaged in the labour market because of different barriers. Their labour market participation is still significantly lower than that of persons without disabilities and this situation has not significantly improved over the past 15 years. The persistent underemployment of persons with disabilities is a dramatic obstacle that does not allow to unfold the fundamental rights of the disabled people and leads to social exclusion from all relevant societal fields.\r\nMoreover, Eurostat analyses show that there is a clear north-south divide in the EU. \r\nEurostat analyses show that there is a clear north-south divide in the EU. In almost all areas, those affected report the smallest daily hurdles in the states of Scandinavia, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and the highest in southern and eastern Europe. \r\nAs early as 2001, Eurobarometer 54.2 showed that in precisely these states (collectively grouped together with the states of Eastern Europe as D EAST item) the social perception of people with disabilities as fully recognized members of society was the least pronounced.  The employment rates of people with disabilities surveyed in 2011 show an equivalent pattern in the respective groups of countries. We assume that the level and type of employment of people with disabilities provides information about the quality of the infrastructure and the social recognition of people with disabilities. At the same time even under the given circumstances there is always a space for innovative approaches and non-trivial solutions.  \r\n\r\nIn the course of our project, we would identify those new innovative solutions and examine them in a best practice comparison.\r\n\r\nIn exact terms, we want to deal with two thematic blocks:\r\n\r\n1) What tools and methods do stakeholders (externals) at different levels use to promote and support the employability of people with disabilities, especially with a strong focus on the first labour market?\r\n\r\n2) How do the involved organisations (NGOs, agencies etc.) practically promote the employability of people with disabilities? What are best practices mechanisms and strategies applied to support people with disabilities trying to enter the first labour market?\r\n\r\nThe aim of the kickoff TPM is to identify relevant fields of actors for area 1) and relevant topics for area 2).\r\nOn the basis of the results drawn up here, the partner organization will prepare the TPM in their respective country, in the course of which a workshop will be held, serving relevant stakeholders to present respective best practice strategies, networking mechanisms and societal approaches to foster the employability of people with disabilities. This will cover all levels, from the association to companies and organisations to policy makers.\r\n\r\nWithin the framework of the TPMs, the respective examples are discussed, classified, benchmarked and filmed. The respective best & worst practice examples are included in the result log and produced as video. This report be published after the end of the project and the video released as a learning film on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe project explicitly serves as a basis for future projects with intellectual outputs. A corresponding pre-structuring and analysis will allow for substantially more specific proposals in terms of content and methodology in different key actions of the ERASMUS+ program as well as for a more detailed scientific analysis of the respective topic area.
