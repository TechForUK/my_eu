French is currently taught at the school but due to MFL becoming statutory in September 2014 the school wishes to improve the quality of provision and ensure that staff are confident and competent when teaching MFL.  The Head teacher, MFL teacher, KS2 Class Teacher and Teaching Assistant are to participate in programme which includes language and methodology-specific classes, cultural sessions and cultural visits, visit to a primary school for observation of practice and an opportunity to make links for future partnership work.\r\n\r\nAttendees will work together to develop their own teaching resources which will be shared within the group and uploaded to a public website so that the wider public can use them. The course is delivered by experienced language teachers and advisors, offering 'full immersion' experience.  Sharing and uploading the resources will mean that staff can still access their work and other participants' contributions on their return to the UK.  KS2 staff will investigate and evaluate examples of teaching materials that can be used in school.  The course includes specific sessions on integrating ICT in language teaching to improve the participants' knowledge of ICT, used specifically in the context of MFL.  This will help the school to develop stronger links with any partner schools, using technology to transfer information and share teaching and learning experiences with them.  It includes a visit to a primary school to provide teachers with the opportunity to observe teaching practice in the target country and make links for potential partnership work.  teachers are keen to forge links with a partner school and it may be possible to develop communications between the schools if there is a common theme or interest that could be developed or worked on together as a project. \r\n\r\nThe participants' competences that will be improved and enhanced by taking part in the training are as follows:  better understanding of creative MFL teaching methods; increased awareness of ICT tools; cultural and up-to-date knowledge of France; an increased level of understanding of teaching techniques and methods; impact on teachers' confidence using the target language.\r\n\r\nThe MFL teacher will be responsible for using the strategies to review and plan a new teaching programme for Y3-Y6 and to lead and organise the Gifted and Talented activities.   Teachers will be able to adopt and try out new methodology on their return to school.  Methodology can also be shared with colleagues from neighbouring schools as the MFL teacher is planning to work in schools from the local 'cluster' during the next academic year, either as a MFL teacher or to provide CPD to other schools' staff to disseminate good practice.   The improved MFL teaching and learning will have an impact on  transition into Y7 and there are plans for the Head Teachers and MFL teachers to meet to develop a strategy for a transition project from Y6 to Y7 to build on language acquisition in Y6.", "http://www.nunthorpeprimaryschool.co.uk", "Nunthorpe Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001988_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TS7"}
