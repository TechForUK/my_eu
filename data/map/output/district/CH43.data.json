This will help us to work together to create a truly whole school approach and embed European dimension in every aspect of our school lives. Through this we want to motivate our boys to value and succeed at their language learning. We will meet these needs through a two year project involving members of different departments and support staff taking part in 8 day immersion courses in Spain and France. We are applying for funding for 27 mobilities over two years to Spain, France, Germany and Italy.We have found courses which are relevant to our staff development needs. They combine language learning at different levels, cultural immersion, methodology and pedagogy and visits to local schools.Staff will work together to develop cross curricular and extracurricular activities, and develop new ways of working and training packages to share with other schools, including our partner primary schools and European link schools. We will encourage them to make return visits to our school, make practical arrangements for future student visits and take the opportunity to plan for activities that we can do together.This project will have a deep and lasting impact on our school, learners and staff and also beyond our school, including within our wider community, other schools in our cluster and schools in Europe. We have planned activities and outcomes that can continue to be used in the long term, impacting on many more people over time. Our project will contribute towards achieving the overall aims of Erasmus +.", "http://www.st-anselms.com", "St Anselm's College Edmund Rice Academy Trust", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023406_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CH43"}
