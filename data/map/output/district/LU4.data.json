The main aim of the club's Academy is to scout and develop players who will potentially reach professional status. However, regardless of the level of success achieved in football, Apprentices receive advice and education that provide a solid platform from which they can move forward and make sound decisions in life. The framework for this education is the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme, a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people with the realistic potential to achieve excellence in sport. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at LTFC. Working with host partner BVSC in Italy, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1. Enhancing the LTFC Academy programme through the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies that facilitate the achievement of vocational learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n2. Embedding the acquisition of Life Skills into the training and development programme and working cultures to equip Apprentices with competences and skills that can be used throughout their career.\r\n\r\n3. Exposing Apprentices to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 18 (male) Apprentices undertaking the LTFC AASE programme in the 2018/19 football season (i.e. the 2017 and 2018 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their football ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the project activities will take place at the BVSC facility, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Italian youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nBVSC has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable LTFC to enhance the project activities of participants. For example:\r\n- Access to top flight Italian football teams, Vicenza Calcio and Brescia Calcio.\r\n- A visit to the Universtiy of Trento.\r\n- Observation of a live Serie A/B fixture. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\nEach phase of project delivery will be managed and monitored via a detailed project work plan that will define key actions and timescales for delivery, including:\r\n\r\nPHASE 1 - PREPARATION:\r\n- A structured preparation programme tailored to the individual needs of participants.\r\n- Production of clear and accessible Information and Guidance resources.\r\n- Preparation of Individual Learning Agreements to be agreed and signed by LTFC, BVSC and participants, clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each in achieving them.\r\n- Pre-visit assessment of participants' individual goals and desired learning outcomes from the project.\r\n- Provision of formal language training and opportunities to demonstrate learnings.\r\n- A formal Logistics Contract outlining who is responsible for each of the practical and logistical aspects of the placement.\r\n- Agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities, formalised via a Memorandum of Understanding. \r\n\r\nPHASE 2 - DELIVERY:\r\n- Development of a detailed itinerary.\r\n- Provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals.\r\n- Clearly defining the assessment methods and techniques to be used to evidence formal and informal learnings.\r\n\r\nPHASE 3 - EVALUATION:\r\n- Delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n- Comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project and individual learning plans.\r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Achievement of recognised vocational qualifications. \r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on LTFC are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the LTFC AASE programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of Apprentices and coaches, and also Apprentice achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the LTFC AASE programme and also the wider Football League AASE programme.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.lutontown.co.uk", "Luton Town Football Club 2020 Limited", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035815_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "name"], "data": [["0DZ", "R1L", "LUTON & DUNSTABLE HOSPITAL"], ["0DZ", "RC9", "LUTON & DUNSTABLE HOSPITAL"], ["0DZ", "RGT", "LUTON AND DUNSTABLE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL"], ["0DZ", "RWK", "LUTON & DUNSTABLE HOSPITAL"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LU4"}
