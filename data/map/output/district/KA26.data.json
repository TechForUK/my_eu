Having previously benefited from a course in the past we were keen to further develop our professional skills and abilities in delivering French to primary school children. The main objective of our project is to discover best practices to bring back and disseminate to colleagues in Scotland, as well as learning and sharing new ideas in both language and cultural experiences. The project will include a visit to a French primary school, participation in singing and games, reading and writing in French, general conversation, cultural excursions and  activities,  all supported by the effective use of ICT with an emphasis on practical classroom ideas.\r\n\r\nWe anticipate the outcome of the project will be a much greater confidence in delivering the Scottish Government's Languages 1+2 initiative from the teachers who have attended the course. This will enable the participants to cascade their learning to both pupils and teachers within the school. They will also be able to share knowledge with colleagues in neighbouring schools through CPD training sessions. This project is building on prior knowledge enabling the school to make further progress in improving methodological expertise in the teaching of French to young learners.", "http://www.girvanprimary.sayr.sch.uk/", "Girvan Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035593_coordinator"], ["9DW", "E to E - Education to Employment", "Girvan Academy", 52783.0, "The Europe 2020 strategy identifies five strategic objectives for the EU, among others employment and education. The participating schools of this partnership all in various ways face the challenges of youth unemployment and students leaving school with poor or insufficient results, and therefore wishes to launch an exchange project with these issues in focus. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project is on pupils\u2019 level to increase the pupils\u2019 awareness of the clear connection between education and employment on an integrated European labour market, and to help the pupils to communicate their skills internationally; on staff level the project aims develop teaching methods that motivate the students to finish their education and helps students to see employment in an international perspective; on community and school level the objective is to establish and deepen contacts with actors on the local labour market and between the partner schools. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project will decide the project activities that will be planned during the teachers\u2019 planning meetings. The general plan of the project activities is however set to work in the home schools, exchange activities during the terms via eTwinning and transnational meetings, where the project partners will present results of the work in each school, evaluate and plan the following semester, and visit local businesses to learn more about the local labour market. \r\n\r\nThe transnational meetings will in all involve around 150 participants (staff and pupils; guests and hosts). The work between the meetings will hopefully involve as many participants as possible in all partner schools, therefore the project tasks must be designed in communication between the partner schools and among staff and pupils. The project tasks will vary, but always be strongly connected to the project themes and designed to encourage the use of ICT and language skills. An important help in these tasks will be the Europass tool. E-mail and the eTwinning tool will be used for communication between the schools during terms. \r\n\r\nThe project will hopefully lead to an increased awareness among students of the importance of education and the fact that the future labour market is international. Staff will be inspired to work with the project themes and to find ways to do it within the national curricula. Contacts between the partner schools and with actors of the local labour market will continue and last longer than the project itself.", "http://www.girvanacademy.sayr.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SE01-KA201-000960_2"], ["9AE", "Entrepreneurial and Employability Advancement", "Ailsa Horizons Limited", 37370.0, "The EE-ADVANCE projects will and identify best practice in the delivery of entrepreneurship, employability and IT skills required for the creation of, and during employment in, different types of companies such as commercial and social companies and co-operatives. The partnership consists of 6 partners from the U.K. Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Romania and the products will be delivered in 6 languages.  \r\n\r\nThe project targets trainers of vocational students and adult learners (250) with up to 50 people from disadvantaged groups. Self-learn activity packs will be provided which will enhance the soft and transversal skills described above.   The self-learn activity packs can also be used in companies to make employees more entrepreneurial in their thinking and to improve their approach to problem solving in the work-place. This cross-sector project, working mainly within Vocational Education and Training and Adult Education will provide stimulating and valuable lessons to be shared across different countries and communities. \r\nIn many EU countries the failure of SME or self-employed traders within the first 5 years for trading is unacceptable high i.e. 30% failure within the first 3 years rising to 50% within the first 5 years of trading. Increased entrepreneurial, employability and IT skills will assist people to gain employment or be self-employed. The need for Lifelong Learning and continuing vocational education in soft skills, particularly with respect to workplace-skills development, is now a necessity as people increasingly change their careers many times during their working life.\r\n\r\nThe project provides learning materials to support the aims of the EU Education and Training 2020 policy with targets of at least 15% of adults involved in Lifelong Learning by 2020 and 75% of people aged between 20 and 64 in employment and less than 10% young people dropping out of education and training by 2020. \r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\u2022 To investigate and identify best practice in entrepreneurial, employability and IT training in VET schools and Adult Learning organisations.  \r\n\u2022 To develop individual self-learn activity packs in entrepreneurial, employability and IT skills which when combined will form a self-learn activity pack to support business start-ups. \r\n\u2022 To pilot the materials within each organisation or within local communities for VET students or adult learners.\r\n\u2022 To develop pathways for Knowledge Exchange and between SMEs and educators.\r\n\u2022 To increase transnational partnership working and the sharing of best practice between 6 partner countries.\r\n\u2022 Provide new self-learn methods of teaching and learning materials which can be used to influence policy makers and educators in each country.     \r\n\r\nOutputs and results:\r\n\u2022 A website to disseminate information and the reposts and learning materials produced by the project.\r\n\u2022 A report on the entrepreneurship, employability and IT skills training available in each country with identified examples of best practice and suggestions for improvements.\r\n\u2022 A report on the different legal status of companies found in each country.\r\n\u2022 A report on the requirements of employers with regards to entrepreneurial thinking in employees.\r\n\u2022 Three individual self-learn activity packs in entrepreneurship, employability and IT skills.\r\n\u2022 Using the activity packs above, a combined self-help activity pack for business start-ups will be produced.\r\n\u2022 Improved partnership working and sharing of ideas.\r\n\u2022 Increased EU mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\nAs a partnership project the UK will act as project coordinator and each partner will lead as work-package in their own specialist area.\r\nThe short-term benefits of the project is the support of vocational students and  adult learners in learning skills for business and employment. The longer-term impact will be to have more sustainable generated as the entrepreneurs starting the businesses have improved skills and are better prepared when they start their business.", "http://www.ailsahorizons.co.uk", "Ailsa Horizons Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013816_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "KA26"}
