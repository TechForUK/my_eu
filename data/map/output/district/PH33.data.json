We are aware that learning languages open doors to possibilities and experiences which are not available to those who are restricted to the knowledge of one language, it also allows a deeper understanding of language construction and formation - even in their mother tongue. Having a knowledge of additional languages provides children with skill for life, learning and work as the growth of business and travel continue to grow.  Positive language learning experiences contribute to young people\u2019s development as successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. \r\n\r\nCurrently Lundavra Primary staff have been rolling out 1+2 from Nursery to Primary 7. Many staff members have attended Power Language Platform training sessions and have cascaded to colleagues during CAP sessions and additional resources accessible from the PLP have been used to enhance French language learning and increase engagement. In order to develop strong European links, make learning more tangible and put their learning into a context, Lundavra Primary School is in the process of partnering with a school in Versailles and although this is at an early stage it is hoped that this will allow children to become even more engaged with learning French language and customs. \r\n\r\nAlthough some staff have attended MFL training others with little or no background in the French language are still lacking in confidence when delivering 1+2.

The growth of tourism worldwide has in many instances led to the revitalisation of rural areas struggling with youth outmigration and decreasing job opportunities in traditional sectors. \r\nAdventure tourism has grown very rapidly worldwide in recent decades, leading to the establishment of new companies and new professional careers which are open both to young people and adults. All partner countries having thriving tourism sectors in their respective regions, as well as educational, innovation and research institutions dedicated to serving their regional communities. However, tourism operates in a very dynamic environment, with ever greater demands on SMEs; to stay competitive and to professionalise the tourism \u2018product\u2019, however, the sector is widely acknowledged as needing to improve its skill base\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nThe main objective of ADVENT (Adventure Tourism Vocational Education and Training) is to strengthen SMEs ability to meet such challenges through increased accessibility of educational and training programs. To do this, collaborative forums need to be created on a cross-sectoral level, with participation of both educational institutes and representatives of tourism SMEs. These forums will identify the educational needs of SMEs and design and develop courses appropriate to meeting them. \r\n\r\nThe Project Consortium\r\nADVENT involves three consortia, with eight partners, in Iceland, Finland and Scotland.  The project is led by FAS, a upper secondary school in southeast Iceland, working with the University of Iceland\u2019s Hornafjordur Regional Research Centre and the local destination management organisation (DMO), Visit Vatnaj\u00f6kull.\r\nIn Finland, the Department of Tourism and Sports at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences is working with the vocational school Kainuun ammattiopisto and Naturpolis, the regional business center in Kuasamo.\r\nThe lead Scottish partner is West Highland College.  A partner college of the University of the Highlands and Islands, it comprises two complementary departments: the School of Adventure Studies and the Centre for Recreation and Tourism Research (CRTR). It will work with the Lochaber Chamber of Commerce, the local DMO which brands the region as the Outdoor Capital of UK.\r\nThe project\u00b4s main target group is adult adventure tourism practitioners, both entrepreneurs and employees, but young students will also benefit from the educational initiatives undertaken. \r\n\r\nProject Activities\r\nThe project\u00b4s main activities involve the development and subsequent piloting of nine innovative study modules, three in each partner country. These will all be monitored and evaluated and then validated or accredited, as appropriate, by the educational institutes involved. The participants in these study modules will all be drawn from SMEs through the national forums in partner countries and thus over time lay the foundation for the creation of a community of practice. It is estimated that around 50-60 individuals will participate directly in project activities. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe project\u00b4s methodology is based on \u2018androgogy\u2019 and places particular emphasis on self-directed and experiential learning. The main results of the project will be new courses, developed in close cooperation with adventure tourism SMEs. These will become part of restructured programs at the educational institutes, targeting adult practitioners. Some study modules will also involve training experienced practitioners to become instructors, both on a peer-to-peer level and for young students. \r\n\r\nProject Impact\r\nThe impact of the project will mainly be felt at the local or regional level, in terms of upskilled local SMEs and young students, the development of new curricula, and through enhanced collaboration between the educational and business sectors. It should also lead to greater interest and motivation among young people in seeking jobs in the adventure tourism sector or starting up their own company. The transnational aspect of the project is highly important to its success and will be given strong attention. \r\n\r\nThe Legacy\r\nThe long-term sustainability of the project\u00b4s results will be ensured by incorporating the developed study modules into existing educational programs and also by restructuring the programs so they can be more responsive to the educational needs of adventure tourism SMEs. The project will furthermore lay the foundation for continued transnational cooperation between the partner countries, e.g. through new possibilities for student and staff mobility between countries. Finally, the long-term benefits of the project will also involve the creation of forums where different sectors can meet and collaborate on tasks that are vital to the sustainability of their local/regional communities, such as enhanced vocational education and training.", "http://www.lochaberchamber.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IS01-KA202-026524_6"], ["6EN", "Adventure Tourism Innovation Partnerships", "Lochaber Chamber of Commerce", 234912.0, "The Adventure Tourism Innovation Partnerships (AVIP) is transformative since it creates lasting impact for HEIs and their graduates, entrepreneurs and businesses, particularly SMEs and their employees; providing flexible learning pathways to enhance learners\u2019 digital and entrepreneurial skills, helping companies respond to the fast-changing adventure tourism environment. Research demonstrates that the HE/VET systems fails to adequately meet learner\u2019s skills needs and businesses are poorly equipped to respond to the transformational changes in tourism. AVIP responds directly to these concerns, offering flexible learning pathways and innovative collaborative delivery models \u2013 addressing low-skills through to higher levels skills provision \u2013 which address regional skills gaps and promote innovation.\r\n\r\nThe tourism industry is one of the largest in the world, accounting for 9% of global GDP. Europe is the world-leading tourist destination and the third largest economic activity in the European Union (9.9% of GDP, rising to 11% by 2026), employing over 25 million people.  Adventure tourism is one of its fastest growing segments growing exponentially year-on-year. ATTA estimated adventure tourism to be worth $263 Bn in 2013, growing at a rate of 195% in three years.\r\n\r\nAdventure tourism is widely recognised as a powerful tool that can promote sustainable growth, generating smart jobs, as well as providing strong incentives for conserving the natural environment. Indeed, Scotland\u2019s \u2018Tourism 2020\u2019 strategy identifies activities and adventure as having real growth potential. The strategy identifies the need to develop skills in a range of areas to support the industry\u2019s ambitions for growth, including: management and leadership; enabling high quality customer experiences; and ensuring the availability of appropriate training.\r\n\r\nYet our HE and VET systems \u2013 often operating in silos - are known to often lack the tools to effectively respond to the challenge. As Professor West, Chair of University Alliance states, \u201cto meet the increasing demand for higher-level skills we need multiple pathways through education, based on collaboration and partnership \u2013 we must not slip into the false divide between vocational and academic pathways\u201d. AVIP tackles this challenge head on; developing innovative partnerships and new models of HE based around highly malleable learning pathways, tailored to meet digital and entrepreneurial skills needed, empowering businesses to respond to growth opportunities within the adventure tourism economy. \r\n\r\nAVIP addresses The EU\u2019s 2020 Growth Strategy in three main ways. First, it promotes smart growth by fostering cooperation between H.E., VET institutions and employers; upskilling students and employees and generating quality jobs. Second, it promotes sustainable growth through promoting adoption of more efficient and innovative marketing measures and thirdly, it promotes inclusive growth, involving job creation in structurally disadvantaged locations as well as offering opportunities for low-skilled to develop new skills. \r\n\r\nAVIP also aligns with the European Tourism Manifesto for Growth and Jobs EU policy priorities, particularly in areas of  skills development, which encourages relationships between training/education providers and industry, and making lifelong learning training available online.\r\n\r\nThe aim is clear: Establish Innovation Partnerships to develop flexible learning pathways that enhance the capacity of businesses to capitalise on the opportunities within adventure tourism. To achieve this AVIP will pursue the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1, Innovation Partnerships and Frameworks HE, VET Institutions and businesses; collaborating to identify skills gaps, develop flexible learning pathways and exchange best practices for results-based pedagogy.\r\n2, Immersion in Digital Technologies. Partners introduce innovative training to transform graduate and SME capacity to digitise their business experience \r\n3, Innovating New Products. Learners will unleash their creative capacity through acquisition of commercialisation skills and competencies.   \r\n4, Open Online Collaboration Platform. An mobile platform promotes \u2018communities of learning\u2019; fostering transnational cooperation to speed up learning to improve innovation through a virtual cluster.   \r\n\r\nAVIP will have a range of impacts:\r\n1,  Innovation Partnerships enhance alignment of regional training systems to better meet the skills needs and exploit the opportunities of regional adventure tourism through innovative Flexible Learning Pathways.\r\n2, Entrepreneurs commercialise new products and services to enhance their competitiveness.\r\n3, Longer term benefits include wider adoption of our Innovation Partnerships and the HE  sector better understanding how to implement our innovative applied learning tools, impacting policy and practice at local, regional, national and international levels.", "http://www.lochaberchamber.co.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS LBG", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA203-036706_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH33"}
