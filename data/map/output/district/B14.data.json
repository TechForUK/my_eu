Over the last few years the ethnic mix of the area has altered considerably from a mainly white indigenous population to a community of many ethnic origins.  The impact of this change has been huge in this community. In recent local elections the community has recorded the highest percentage of votes for right wing candidates than in any other ward in the city. The socio economic background places our families in the highest multiple deprivation groups in the city. \r\n\r\nThe school tackles the factors of high unemployment, low aspirations and lack of community cohesion in many ways. One of the main strategies used is restorative justice as a means of increasing a sense of community and responsibility within our pupils. We are constantly seeking and finding ways to improve our practice in this area, and indeed have many links with schools both in our immediate area and beyond. The idea of working with another school in the international arena, whose ethos and belief in community cohesion is similar to ours is extremely attractive.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives for this project are: \r\n- Developing the European dimension within the teaching and learning in our setting. \r\n- Improve the quality of education through sharing of experiences. \r\n- Develop new strategies and tools using Information Technology and Communication \r\n- Encourage a climate of  respect and conflict resolution, applying emotional intelligence through restorative practices.\r\n\r\nThere will be a total of sixteen staff involved in the mobility. Their job specifications vary. There are a number of teachers and teaching assistants who will be observing and shadowing colleagues in the receiving school. The head of our pastoral team, together with our senior learning mentor will be a part of this project. These are key people as it is their responsibility to instill and maintain the sense of responsibility, tolerance and community within our school. There will be a member of the school senior leadership team to ensure the smooth running of the project, and to ensure the longer term sustainability of the link.\r\n\r\nOur project aims to build a shared learning. The job shadowing activities are aimed at developing the pedagogical skills of teachers and their expertise in research methodologies. We can all learn from each other , share experiences and exchange views and ideas . Before mobility we will prepare various consultation activities with our Spanish counterparts , including their culture , language, customs and educational system. During mobility we will participate in different activities, workshops and seminars during the days of the visits. We will need to make two visits to the school. The first, early in the project to make the initial contact and another in the second year in order to make the exchange of experiences and learning , implement the necessary improvements and internalize the methodology , teaching and learning strategies, and strengthening the links between the schools. \r\n\r\nAs a result of this project, the staff involved will be subject to new and different ideas to support the needs of the pupils in our school. They will disseminate these ideas to their colleagues, ensuring that all staff have exposure to them and will demonstrate the strategies through informal observation and team teaching. There will be a wider aspect to our curriculum, based on the international dimension, which will ensure that our pupils are constantly working with this in mind, therefore embedding the wider community idea in their lives. There will be a sustained link between the two schools, with regular communication between pupils using email, skype video conferencing and any other new technologies available. Longer term, our pupils will will become more aware and tolerant of the wider community and cultures. Their aspirations for travel and work will be raised, and as a result, the current climate of worklessness and low income reduced.", "http://www.hightersheath.co.uk", "Highters Heath Community School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002269_coordinator"], ["7BH", "Creative Minds - Learning and Enterprise through Adult Education", "PRAXIS EUROPE CIC", 65878.0, "Our project seeks to:\r\n\r\n*take 40 trainers (4 flows of 10) from across the UK to Turkey, on a 1 week  Adult Education training course to Istanbul. \r\n*Improve trainer skills and competences in working with disadvantaged communities in an appropriate manner \r\n*Enhance the level of adult education provision across our organisation and network of partners\r\n*Use valuable adult learning methodologies developed by our Turkish partner to engage and support hard to reach communities\r\n*Examina and traial ( back in the UK) adult education provsion around arts, crafts, self employment and social enterprise\r\n*Use the learning captured to meet our own organisational needs (around new services, recognition of skills, staff training needs, learning and sharing ideas to common problems)\r\n\r\nThe course will enable our trainers to examine and test Adult Education and Training Methodologies based around arts and crafts used by ISMEK to engage, support and train disadvantaged Muslim and other BME women, by helping them to develop skills in order to be able to access learning, training and then move into labour market opportunities.\r\n\r\nOur trainers work with women who have no recognisable skills, qualifications and have never worked, they lack language skills and have had difficulty integrating into UK life, education or work. These women have been prevented from working through traditions, cultural and religious beliefs. These women maybe living in poverty, excluded from mainstream society and in many cases unable to take control of their own lives. Our trainers work with these women to build confidence, self-esteem, skills and levels of health care. We are seeking to improve the lives of these women by giving them the skills and confidence to learn/work and in doing so address issues like benefit dependency, social inclusion, poverty as well as women\u2019s rights. Recent pro education campaigns led by Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan/UK have energised UK BME women to seek an education and take control of their lives. Our  trainers are working with these groups to empower and help educate them, given  the landscape of national adult education training budget cuts. \r\n\r\nThrough this project we seek  train our trainers with innovative adult education methodologies that can be applied in the UK or more broadly with other EU organisations seeking to meet the needs of this client group. \r\n\r\nTraining Course will provide an opportunity for our trainers to examine, test and explore the teaching methods used to engage, teach, up skill women of all ages so they can become productive part of society. Our trainers would  explore ISMEK adult education social enterprise (SE), engagement, training systems, progression routes, dealing with complex cultural barriers to learning. This would enable our trainers to see how ISMEK promotes adult learning, skills and provide women with a living wage that can be used to help overcome traditional barriers faced by women. This SE is a true innovation as it has generated skills development, confidence, empowerment as well as a turnover of over 2 million Turkish Lira for women participants. ISMEK does not keep the income the women generate. The women produce high-end luxury arts and craft goods. Our learning has shown that  our teaching systems need to be improved in order to better support disadvantaged BME women through culturally sensitive training. the ISMEK training course provides a real opportunity to learn and and modernise our adult education provision.\r\n\r\nThe results we are seeking from the project include:\r\n*Better trained staff and services \r\n*Modernisation of learning \r\n*Increased networking and learning between partners.\r\n*The transfer and implementation of best practice into learning \r\n*Positive learning development for our learners that lead to attitudinal change across deprived BME communities\r\n\r\nThese results will have a longer term value in making sure services are focused and relevant to client need.

As a result of it, youth often gets socially excluded from the society and finds it difficult to actively participate in it. One of the ways to tackle these problems is social entrepreneurship. To promote this concept, a project \u201cMore than Money: Social Entrepreneurship Heroes\u201d will be hosted in Lithuania. It will consist of two actions: youth workers mobility (September 20-27, 2014) and a youth exchange (October 25 \u2013 November 2, 2014). The project is implemented by organizations from countries where youth unemployment and other social problems are especially acute (Lithuania, Spain, Italy, Romania, Turkey, UK). In the 1st action there will be 24 youth workers involved (4 / country); while the 2nd action will have 36 participants (5 unemployed youngsters aged 18-30, 1 youth worker from the 1st action / country). Priority will be given to those from disadvantaged backgrounds and with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the project is to: (1) teach youth workers the essentials of social entrepreneurship and the non-formal education (NFE) methods to share this knowledge; (2) coach unemployed youth on how to create their own social enterprises and the key skills needed for that; (3) generate fresh ideas for social enterprises. At the same time the project intends to promote the concept of social entrepreneurship amongst the target groups and the general public. In the long run this would ensure a positive impact on both youth unemployment and the resultant problems throughout the participating countries. The project also aims to help the participants grow professionally, keep them active, involve them in multi-cultural discussions, develop a number of skills and competences and create new partnerships across Europe.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these objectives, a range of NFE methods developed by all the partner organisations will be employed. Main activities will identify benefits of social entrepreneurship, teach the competences needed, and create the means of spreading information about the concept to the public. Involvement, creativity and initiative of all the participants will be encouraged throughout the activities, which will include: 1) interactive workshops, 2) generation of new NFE methods, 3) discussions in non-formal environment, 4) meeting social entrepreneurs, 5) country presentations, 6) visits to social enterprises, 7) application of art and sport as NFE methods, 8) analyses of relevant video materials, 9) quizzes, 11) specialized group exercises, games, 12) feedbacks, reflections, evaluations and much more. In order to facilitate integration of the participants: 13) cultural evenings, 14) energizers, 15) ice-breaking and socializing activities will also be organised. Since the project goal is to reach the public and disseminate the results effectively: 16) special videos, 17) workshops for unemployed and 18) e-booklet will be prepared by the participants. All of this will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations and the target groups in regional, national and international levels. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will not only improve a number of skills and competences, but will also get a chance to extend their networks by meeting potential investors, social entrepreneurs, etc. This would make them more competitive professionally and help them in creating their own social enterprises. The participating organisations would increase their knowledge on social entrepreneurship and learn new NFE methods, all of which could be used in their future initiatives. At the same time, the project would help them grow internationally, increase public awareness of their actions and enhance their capacities of reaching the objectives of youth development.\r\n\r\nGeneral public and unemployed youth within it are expected to be impacted as well.  Firstly, the participants will share the knowledge acquired throughout the project in workshops for the unemployed within their own communities. Likewise the participating organizations will employ social media and similar future projects to promote the concept of social entrepreneurship. The results dissemination will be also facilitated through involvement of mass-media and spreading of videos and e-booklet prepared during the project. As a result, unemployed youth in participating countries are expected to increase their chances of getting employed and/or actively involved in the society.\r\n\r\nThe project is anticipated to not only help participating youth enhance their skills and get involved in social entrepreneurship, but also increase general awareness of this concept in participating countries.

These women have been prevented from working through traditions, cultural and religious beliefs. They may be living in poverty, excluded from mainstream society and in many cases unable to take control of their own lives. Our trainers work with these women to build confidence, self-esteem, skills and levels of health care. We are seeking to improve the lives of these women by giving them the skills and confidence to learn/work and in doing so address issues like benefit dependency, social inclusion, poverty as well as women\u2019s rights. Recent pro education campaigns led by Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan/UK have energised UK BME women to seek an education and take control of their lives. Our  trainers are working with these groups to empower and help educate them, given  the landscape of national adult education training budget cuts. \r\n\r\nThrough this project we seek to  train our trainers with innovative adult education methodologies that can be applied in the UK or more broadly with other EU organisations seeking to meet the needs of this client group, who tend to be poorly qualified and facing higher levels of deprivation and disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe training course will provide an opportunity for our trainers to examine, test and explore the teaching methods used to engage, teach and up-skill women of all ages so they can become productive part of society. Our trainers would explore ISMEK adult education social enterprise, engagement, training systems, progression routes and dealing with complex cultural barriers to learning. This would enable our trainers to see how ISMEK promotes adult learning and skills and provides women with a living wage that can be used to help overcome traditional barriers faced by women. This social enterprise is a true innovation as it has generated skills development, confidence, empowerment as well as a turnover of over 2 million Turkish Lira for women participants. ISMEK does not keep the income the women generate. The women produce high-end luxury arts and craft goods. Our learning has shown that our teaching systems need to be improved in order to better support disadvantaged BME women through culturally sensitive training. The ISMEK training course provides a real opportunity to learn and and modernise our adult education provision.\r\n\r\nThe results we are seeking from the project include:\r\n*Better trained staff and services \r\n*Modernisation of adult education and learning \r\n*Increased networking and learning between partners.\r\n*The transfer and implementation of best practice into learning and positive progression routes for learners (where mainstreamed options are not working) \r\n*Positive learning development for our learners that lead to attitudinal change across deprived BME communities\r\n\r\nThese results will have a longer term value in making sure services are focused and relevant to client need.

There will be 36 youth participants (6 per country | aged 18-30 | with priority given to those coming from disadvantaged backgrounds).To achieve its goal, the project has set the following objectives: 1) to identify which decisions contribute the most and which are the most detrimental to the quality of life in the long-run; 2) come up with guidelines that best describe the \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 choices; 3) develop an evaluation system for various plans; 4) employing the created system design certain initiatives, that would in the long-run lead to a happier individual and society; and 5) promote them further for the target groups (youth, youth workers, career advisers) and wider public across Europe. The project also aims to help the participants grow professionally and increase their chances in future careers.A range of non-formal education (NFE) methods and meetings with relevant decision makers will be carried out. Involvement, creativity and initiative of all the participants will be encouraged throughout the activities, which will include: 1) interactive workshops & simulations, 2) discussions in a non-formal environment, 3) case studies & creative tasks, 4) country presentations on the topic, 5) \u2018human-sized\u2019 survey, 6) application of art as a mean of NFE, 7) analysing relevant video material, 8) creation of more sensible assessment system for decisions, 9) pitch challenge for the best initiatives, 10) specialized group exercises, quizzes, 11) feedbacks, reflections, evaluations & more. In order to facilitate integration of the participants: 12) cultural evenings, 13) ice-breaking & socialising activities will also be organised. Since the project goal is to reach the public and to disseminate the results effectively: 14) videos & testimonials on the topic, 15) photo-wall & t-shirts with related slogans and 16) an e-booklet will be prepared by all the participants. All of this will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations and the target groups in regional, national and international levels.  Through these activities the participants will improve useful competences, such as ability to assess the impact of decisions and generate new ideas and plans. They will also get a unique chance to extend their social networks. Likewise, the participating organisations would increase their knowledge on the matter and learn new non-formal education methods, all of which could then be used in their own future initiatives. At the same time, the project would help them grow internationally, increase public awareness of their actions and enhance their capacities of reaching the objectives of youth development.Wider audiences & target groups are expected to be impacted as well. Firstly, the participants will share the knowledge acquired throughout the project within their own communities.

This SE is a true innovation as it has generated skills development, confidence, empowerment as well as a turnover of over 2 million Turkish Lira for women participants. ISMEK does not keep the income the women generate. The women produce high-end luxury arts and craft goods. Our learning has shown that  our teaching systems need to be improved in order to better support disadvantaged BME women through culturally sensitive training. the ISMEK training course provides a real opportunity to learn and and modernise our adult education provision.The results we are seeking from the project include:*Better trained staff and services *Modernisation of adult education and learning *Increased networking and learning between partners.*The transfer and implementation of best practice into learning and positive progression routes for learners (where mainstreamed options are not working) *Positive learning development for our learners that lead to attitudinal change across deprived BME communitiesThese results will have a longer term value in making sure services are focused and relevant to client need.

Surely, these issues could be tackled by more cycling, which is still not popular enough in some of the countries. With this in mind, youth organizations from Italy, Poland, Spain, Lithuania, UK and Denmark have united for this project with the aim to make cycling more popular as a mean of healthy, cheap & sustainable transport. To reach the aim, a youth exchange - Cycle & the City will be hosted in Lithuania on September 4 - 10, 2017 (+a 2-day APV in August). It will involve 36 open-minded youngsters (18-30 years old) willing to change cycling culture in Europe.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nTo achieve this aim, the following objectives were set: (1) promote cycling as a means of transport both for leisure and work, and the health benefits that come along; (2) lobby for the maintenance of a safe, convenient, efficient and accessible cycling network in participating regions; (3) reduce the actual and perceived dangers faced by cyclists; and (4) appeal to drivers to respect bikes on the road.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES:\r\nA number of activities have been planned in order to help fulfill the project objectives, which include 1) interactive workshops on cycling initiatives, and the benefits they bring; 2) discussions on cycling as a mean of transport in non-formal environment; 3) assessing cycling routes and bicycle rental points in the cities to propose strategical actions to the local municipalities; 4) interactive sessions with experts on cycling, healthy-lifestyle, and public route planning;  5) creative art sessions on the topic;  6) cycling events: critical mass, games for kids, info sessions in the city;  7) visit to local municipality to propose cycling initiatives, 8) analysis of relevant video materials, and much more.\r\n\r\nSince the project goal is to reach the public and disseminate the results effectively participants will: \r\n- prepare an e-booklet focusing on the ways to promote cycling to youth;\r\n- create open cycling events in Kaunas, where participants would engage the public to various activities; \r\n- share good cycling practices from Denmark, UK and Valencia to the public and local decision makers;\r\n- use social media, press and other on-line tools to deliver results further.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that the project would induce a positive effect on the participants, organisations and the target groups (young people, youth workers, local authorities and the wider public) in regional, national and international levels.\r\n\r\nIMPACT TO PARTICIPANTS:\r\nParticipating youth will learn about cycling activities across Europe, including the ways they are organized and maintained. They will also gather all the necessary knowledge needed for responsible and safe cycling. On top of that, they will learn more about healthy lifestyle and other positive aspects associated with cycling. This will be a base for them in eventually becoming \"Cycling Ambassadors\" in their countries. \r\n\r\nAll the participants will also learn how to effectively communicate in team (as most of the activities will require teamwork). They will also acquire the knowledge and experience needed to: 1) generate ideas; and then 2) create and implement public cycling and sports initiatives. This includes: their understanding of the key organizational things, including vision and mission, values, long-term strategy, marketing, public relations, budget and financing. The participants will learn how to attract the necessary investments for social activities and what are the EU laws for setting up an initiative. Our anticipation is that all this learning will make them self-sufficient in any future endeavors (not just cycling).\r\n\r\nFURTHER IMPACT:\r\nThe project is anticipated to not only help participating youth enhance their skills and competences, but also increase general awareness of the urban cycling culture in participating countries. The essential lasting impact of the project will be the necessary positive policy changes on cycling  that could be made as a result of participant interaction with and suggestions to policy makers.

At the same time, while focusing on Antisemitism towards Judaism, for the sake of finding solutions to similar problems towards other religions, our activities and final product; Tolerance Town aims to contribute to the dialogue between religions by finding out the similarities between the cultures and religions and raising awareness of these similarities. We will establish this by showing Islam\u2019s with its all beauty and discovering similarities and common points with Christianity and Judaism. We think that raising awareness among religions will be effective in breaking prejudice towards different religions. We prepared our activity schedule by using activities which everyone will enjoy and common learning methods which will give the participants the chance of participating actively.\r\n\r\nWe will enable representing different important religions in partnering countries by creating a model of the religious and historical landmarks. We will give a place on each of the models for both a disclaimer for the landmark and various historical and religious people, books and idioms encouraging tolerance. Common point of the messages will be that all individuals who think differently or from different religions convey the same message.\r\n\r\nIn our town there will also be a religious or historical character that each participant represents. Our purpose is again, to raise awareness that no matter how distant from each other, actually they have many similarities. Each participant will study the characters they choose in details and they will make a costume to represent it thanks to the recycling activity that each participant will carry out by using old clothes. By coinciding our final activity with the candy feast following Ramadan, we will try to let our participants make them feel a festival which belongs to Islam and make a connection between their festivals and Eid al-Fitr. While our participants go out for trick-and-treating with costumes, they will tell the families and shopkeepers about Halloween, our project, Erasmus+ programme, and invite them to the opening of the Tolerance Town as their guests. In our opening, we will express our purpose of acquiring a world without prejudice in which there is tolerance, and that there are many common points between religions by basing our thoughts upon the similar messages of different religions and the similarities between Halloween and Eid al-Fitr.\r\n\r\nWe will also produce a magazine in which all the details about our project will take place in order to contribute to the results of our project.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.
