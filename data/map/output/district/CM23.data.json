Many factors influence urban security, from the physical layout to the social and economic makeup of urban zones, from the political and economic landscape on a national level to the daily practices of public services that are active in the area. Seemingly unrelated events may trigger sudden escalation of unrest in neighbourhoods that have been under social tension for a prolonged period of time. Europe has seen many severe instances of urban unrest in recent times, but also the rapid expansion of new urban environments, and new types of communities due to migration, economic tension and social developments. These developments demand a better understanding of urban security throughout Europe, and more sensible policy development to create safer urban environments, and prevent undesirable security scenarios.\n\n\n\nPolicy makers need to know and understand which factors directly or indirectly impact urban security and safety. This includes an appreciation of security status (such as threat levels and potential for crime) as well as public perception of safety and security. A failure by policy makers to timely recognise and mitigate such threats may allow unrest to develop, and consequently affect the prosperity and functionality of the area. Policy makers need to become aware of the interdependency of factors, and define policy based on that comprehension. However, in reality, most decisions are made on the basis of local, long-standing best practices. Given the universal importance of urban security, it is vital to share knowledge and practices among stakeholders throughout Europe, and to jointly work on a common understanding of urban security.\n\n\n\nThe project \u2018Best practice Enhancers for Security in Urban Regions\u2019 (BESECURE) will work towards a better understanding of urban security through examination of different European urban areas. By examining 8 urban areas throughout Europe, BESECURE will build a comprehensive and pragmatic set of indicators, and a pragmatic risk assessment model that can provide cues about the development of certain scenarios. BESECURE will improve urban security policy making by sharing best practices that are in use throughout Europe, and by providing visualisation and assessment tools and guidelines that will help local policy makers to assess the impact of their practices, and improve their decision making.", 143340.0, 3525343.0, "BESECURE", "Best practices for urban security", "Policymakers are being given the right tools to help foster more secure urban environments.", "Urban security in Europe is a crucial process that also varies from country to country in terms of both approach and focus. Therefore, finding a methodology that works and supports the common goal of creating safer living conditions and resilience is key.\n\nThis is one of the main aims of the EU-funded project 'Best practice enhancers for security in urban environments' (http://www.besecure-project.eu (BESECURE)) . The initiative seeks to support local policymakers in their efforts to heighten and apply advanced urban zone security measures.\n\nThe project identified a need for finding and handling the primary symptoms that impact urban security in order to prevent any escalation in threatening scenarios. Utilising a best practice approach by combining interlinked datasets to function as a warning system is the most effective method to cover all needs across countries. BESECURE groups its four main objectives in the categories knowledge, understand, develop and transfer, which appropriately describes the pattern of what achieving urban security entails.\n\nWhen policymakers have the right tools based on background material as well as innovative data, they can create the appropriate policies to effectively instil measures of urban security. Thus, key project activities involve not only research but also the creation of a support tool and eight case studies in order to arrive at an integrated policy design support platform.\n\nA prototype of the platform has been created and this has propelled the internal project development plan.

Most of their day is spent speaking English with their students who have a lower level of English, which can result in a slow decline of their own language skills. It is therefore very important they have regular contact with a native speaker, preferably one teaching the same subject in an authentic English learning environment. We  will send 15 teachers to our partner school in Bishop's Stortford, UK, for a 4 day course. The first two days will be spent job shadowing, where they will experience how their subjects are taught in an English school. Their subject-specific vocabulary will enlarge and their general classroom English will improve.  The teachers will have the opportunity to exchange information about teaching didactics and pedagogical matters with their English partners. \r\nThis will be followed by a two day CLIL training course tailormade by a renown CLIL expert, Ms Janet Streeter. \r\nHaving confident teachers with a high command of English and CLIL skills will have a positive effect on not only our students, but also on our other colleagues and teachers-in-training.  This will result in maintaining the high standards of our bilingual programme.\r\nLastly, there will be an exchange of cultures which will be beneficial to all parties including the students at the Bishop's Stortford High School.
