We wanted our children to value the lives and communities of others in a very different part of the world; to realise we could learn from this community and not to \u2018feel sorry for them\u2019 because they had fewer material things. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Spanish is taught across KS2 by our languages coordinator. This is a fantastic experience for our pupils and they really enjoy the sessions but over reliance on one teacher means our current model is not sustainable.

We want our MFL coordinator to be able to offer support to other schools across Sheffield, multiplying her impact. It would be much more effective if class teachers and support staff were actively involved in promoting Spanish in school, allowing the co ordinator more opportunities to offer this support.\r\n\r\nThe MFL coordinator will develop her role of supporting and coaching in school. We need our specialist teacher to further develop leadership competencies and to take a strong lead role in supporting her colleagues. She will have the chance to discuss this with colleagues from other schools and see how subject management is approached in Spanish schools.\r\n\r\nIt is now a requirement to teach language in KS2 , and many schools also require teachers to have in KS1; we want to encourage all staff to develop their language skills.

Sea urchin breeding will be performed starting from adult specimens obtained from capture. Sea urchin roe (gonads) are first class food and are worldwide commercialised. This project arises from the increasing demand of sea urchin roes and is addressed to the feasibility of sea urchin aquaculture, broodstock and gonad improvement. In the last fifteen years, the aquaculture of sea urchin has been carried out by non-European factories, mainly in Japan, USA and Canada. Unsexed whole sea urchins or their processed gonads are shipped primarily to Japanese markets and to markets in France, Belgium, Greece, Italy and Turkey.

Environmental conditions and broodstock tank construction should therefore be conducive to the occurrence of natural spawning, ensuring the collection of embryos of the highest possible quality. Under the correct environmental conditions, the most important of these being temperature and photoperiod regimes, combined with the proper physical surroundings, courtship and mating will take place in populations of captive broodstock. In addition to increasing the quality of the collected eggs, it should also be noted that animal welfare will be significantly improved by replacing stripping with natural spawning - without the use of hormones. Furthermore, it should be noted that some fish species considered to be good candidates for aquaculture are so susceptible to handling that the only feasible method of obtaining embryos will be through natural spawning; two such species are included in the study.  While the correct environmental cues will induce natural spawning in captive fish, the physical features of the holding tanks may be manipulated to reduce the negative behavioural traits which may impede courtship. To achieve this end for flatfish, each female will be provided with a \u201cbreeding nest\u201d, a gravel-filled structure, while demersal round-fish species will be held in shallow raceways so broodfish populations can perform schooling behaviour along a high-speed current axis.

Thus, there is an enormous need to find a sustainable technology for an efficient cleaning of the tank surfaces and the standpipe meshes. Meshes on the standpipe, which prevent the aquatic life from being sucked away from the water flow, need to be continuously replaced due to the formation of biofilms, resulting in high material and labour costs.

Relevant training activity will provide the necessary safety regulations for implementation of laser systems for ultimate clinical use in the future. For enabling such KT activities, the UK partners have strong evidence for previous KT activities through collaborative training at PhD research, which led to the \u201cproofs-of-concept\u201d and formed the basis for LUSTRE-IAPP.  The flow of knowledge transfer is also geared towards manufacturing within the SME sector via value addition for commercialisation, by accruing benefits for the knowledge generating partners,  long term collaboration, impact on sustainable training, and commercial exploitation opportunities in future for public health impact in the area of oral and dental health. Immediate impact is expected in reducing the spread of acid erosion and tooth loss in the general population.

The overall project aims are to improve the quality of the implants, reduce the recovery time, improve the quality of life for the patients and reduce the healthcare costs.  This will be achieved by allowing surgeons to personalise the implants to fit the patient and the individual trauma, thus reducing the need for revisions, the length of surgery time and the recovery time of the patient.  While the technology is available and can deliver the well-recognised benefits of using personalised implants, the number of clinical cases is still limited. The main reasons that the technology has not been widely applied for treatment in hospitals, are the complexity of the delivery process, the high cost of implants and the lack of human and technological resources in the area of biomodelling in hospitals. Especially, the multidisciplinary communication among radiologists, surgeons, and biomedical engineers, which is always needed during the design and manufacturing steps of a patient specific implant. In addition, the optimal solutions and funding for investment of hardware and software are not always available. The work to be undertaken in ImplantDirect will help overcome these issues by the realisation of two key innovations:\n1) An innovative software solution that will allow the surgeon to directly design the \u2018best\u2019 (not limited by existing manufacturing techniques) implant shape for his patients, based on CT-scan data, which will then allow implant creation using the flexible Rapid Manufacturing technique of Selective Laser Melting.\n2) Develop the Selective Laser Melting process and post-processing necessary to deliver functional Ti6Al4V personalised implants within 3 days from receiving the designs from innovation 1.", 93187.0, 1242826.0, 7, 9, "Implant Direct", null, "http://www.jri-ltd.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-08/161121.jpg", "fp7_104802_967502445"], [1470009600000, 1485820800000, "Arthroscopic Regenerative Medicine for Early-Stage Treatment of OA", "Jri Orthopaedics Limited", "Osteoarthritis (OA) affects about 10% of the global population. It has a major impact on a patient\u2019s quality of life; with pain and physical function being worse than chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or even cardiovascular disease. Its prevalence is increasing, by 2020 it will be the 4th leading cause of disability. OA is caused by \u2018wear and tear\u2019 and currently only symptoms are treated using pain killers until major surgery is needed, then the joint is replaced. Although joint replacements have improved and often last over 30 years, they do fail with about 10% of all joint replacement operations being to fix a failed implant. \nIn this project JRI is working with University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), The Netherlands and the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult (CGT), UK, to develop a new treatment of OA in the hip and take it to market. This involves catching the disease early when it appears as a distinct lesion. JRI has developed Hummingbird, a system that can get into the complex anatomy of the hip and precisely cut out patches of diseased tissue. Then treating these patches with a cell-based treatment developed by UMCU and successfully used to treat OA in the knee.\nJRI believes that this treatment can be provided at a competitive price and at a scale to meet the global market. However, to do this they will need to build a robust business case and define in detail the regulatory pathways to the markets in Europe and USA. They will do this by working with CGT.\nThis Feasibility Study is the first phase of this work. With CGT, JRI will define: the regulatory pathway, the cost of providing the treatment, the reimbursement methods and the likely market share. The second phase will be in the first-in-human study and a critical step in both meeting the regulations and defining the benefits to this cell-based treatment being applied to the hip.\nThis treatment may not cure OA, but should delay major joint surgery and, in time, may allow some to avoid it all together.", 42955.0, 61365.0, 1, 1, "ARMOURY", null, "http://www.jri-ltd.co.uk", null, "h2020_205137_967502445"]]}}, "2YP": {"cordis": {"data": [[1356998400000, 1419984000000, "Super-Stabilised Opaque Foam Coatings for Architectural Applications", "Ronseal Limited", "A white coating\u2019s opacity derives from some light absorption but predominantly light scattering, which is a function of differences in refractive index between paint components. In conventional white decorative coatings, for example, the main contribution to scattering is the difference in refractive index between titanium dioxide pigment (n=2.7) and the continuous medium, the resin system (n\u22481.5). Titanium dioxide has one of the highest refractive indices known, and is certainly the most widely used white pigment, but in recent years the price of titanium dioxide has increased rapidly and there will be serious supply shortages in the foreseeable future.\nAt the same time, there is a growing awareness of sustainability and environmental issues in the chemical industry and particularly the coatings industry, and methodologies, such as life cycle analysis and carbon footprints, are being developed to quantify the \u2018environmental friendliness\u2019 of coatings\u2019 materials and products. Titanium dioxide pigment is one of the major contributors to a coating\u2019s carbon footprint and the manufacturing process for titanium dioxide produces unwanted waste products.\nAnother way of enhancing opacity in a white coating is the inclusion of air (n=1), which can improve the efficiency of titanium dioxide as an opacifier, air has environmental and cost benefits. The DRYFOAM project will develop novel opaque architectural coatings, based on a foam structure. It aims to develop stable and tough foam scaffolds within coatings, particularly for ceilings and interior walls, capable of withstanding normal wear and tear conditions.

Originally, it has been developped for children with cerebral palsy.  The aim was to prepare them for integration into mainstream school system with the help of support in special kindergarten- and schoolgroups.

Empowerment and establishing of preconditions for inclusion are central concerns.\r\nMainly for persons leaving these school groups, in the past ten years the need for following settings has become apparent. So day structuring  facilities based on the principles of Conductive Education have been established. There are also some places where sheltered living with Conductive Education is offered. However, there is quite an uncertainty how Conductive Education can be adapted to meet the demands of adult participants. There has so far not been any exchange of opinion and good practice.
