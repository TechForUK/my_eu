In order to avoid territorial polarization and reduce regional disparities, marginal territories endowment has to be improved in terms of accessibility, entrepreneurship and local capacities. These areas thus represent a great opportunity in terms of job opportunities as they offer a less saturated market, but conditions have to be created in order to effectively attract qualified workforce. Opportunities have then to be tailored on these marginal areas specific contexts, notably rich in ecological and cultural heritage but lacking in accessibility and connectivity. The S.T.R.E.E.T. project thus focuses on two main economic fields: alternative mobility and sustainable tourism. In this sense the travel and tourism sector contributes in 2014 to 9% of EU total GDP, with a predicted growth rates of over 4% annual, representing a possible trigger to revamp the economy of these territories.\r\nMobility and tourism are l well-formed professional contexts at European level and already; however, the project intends to be innovative by matching the two sectors and in particular by applying mobility management competences to non-urban environments, creating a new professional profile as Expert for Sustainable Mobility and Tourism.\r\nThe project thus aims at designing and implementing a training programme addressed to young unemployed or underemployed persons available on the labour market, with an academic (e.g. architecture, engineering, etc.) or high school degree, post-school diploma, and/or VET post-degree and/or having previous experiences in alternative mobility or sustainable tourism fields. They will be provided with cross-cutting and transversal competences, ranging from sustainable mobility management, related to the preservation of natural and ecological estates, to effective tourist flows attraction, fostering accessibility and services. \r\nFive partners coming from Italy, the United Kingdom, Slovenia and Austria, belonging to different domains  and dealing with different topics (public/private, training, counselling, transport, sustainable tourism\u2026), will therefore cooperate to provide these opportunities to a wide number of individuals and organizations. \r\nFirst of all, to the above described target group and, then, to a wide number of stakeholders. Companies and freelances working in the mobility and tourism fields will benefit from the presence of a recognized professional role with specific competences on sustainable tourism, soft and alternative mobility, spatial planning, etc. They can improve their workload, collaborate with professionals with a specific expertise and represent relevant job opportunities for participants. Finally municipalities and public bodies, beyond being potential employers and contractors, can benefit from the analysis of different national and regional framework contexts well-formed professional contexts, improving their decision-making process.\r\nTo reach project objectives and these target groups, S.T.R.E.E.T. will implement an e-learning Platform, fostering an on line basic course open to all participants coming from the participating partners regions and, based on result achieved upon its completion, 63 young participants will be selected to participate to a training activity abroad. This activity will take place in all partner countries: Turin and surrounding areas (IT), Salzburg Alpine area (AT), Municipality of Bled (SI), London (UK) and will focus on the analysis of selected case studies, through an intensive programme lasting 5 days.\r\nThe case studies will be chosen according to the analysis of best practices, innovative solutions adopted, problem solving approaches, strategies, etc. to deal with alternative mobility and sustainable tourism. These analysis results will be collected in the so-called S.T.R.E.E.T. Toolbox which will be made available and disseminated to all interested public.\r\nThis means that the project will not end upon its closure, but is designed to become sustainable and continue on a long term.\r\nThe S.T.R.E.E.T. Platform will remain on line and will progressively supply more courses focused on specialist topics, having the Toolbox as a textbook for all attendants. The Platform will also become a virtual job placement space with a network of firms/enterprises offering jobs or internship opportunities, an exchange platform for experts to compare and confront best practices, a reference guide with tourism opportunities. \r\nThe S.T.R.E.E.T. project is developed at transnational level, as it will offer to participants opportunities to better understand foreign contexts, take part in a training activity abroad and be supported by a stable European network.
