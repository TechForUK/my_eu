Furthermore the Austrian economy keeps stressing the fact that theoretical knowledge is not sufficient, but should be supported by professional practice. As Bundeshandelsakademie und Bundeshandelsschule LInz competes with other higher vocational colleges in which work practice (also abroad) is mandatory, it is of great importance to offer our students an opportunity of a work experience in foreign countries. In this way we make them competitive for the job market thus increasing their employability.  \r\n\r\nGoals:\r\n- higher qualification of students by work experience\r\n- better preparation for their jobs\r\n- improvement of their English language skills\r\n- acquiring European competence\r\n- increasing their employability\r\n- better chances on the job market\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n- increased practical competences in dealing with everday professional situations\r\n- better knowledge of business administration\r\n- better social competence especially when dealing with employers, co-workers, and customers\r\n- improved English language skills\r\n- better knowledge of the English culture, the English way of life and England's economy\r\n- increased motivation in their future studies\r\n- improvement of performance in school\r\n- better understandig for European cooperation\r\n- willingness to be more flexible in the job\r\n- the meaning of  EU-citizenship\r\n- valuing the freedom of travelling within the EU\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the two activities there will be 32 (15/17) students in the third year of the Handelsakademie involved as well as four teachers, the Youth Exchange Service, 32 (15/17)employers and 32 (15/17) host families in England.\r\n\r\nThe students work in various companies  and organistions where especially administrative tasks are assigned to them.

In Europe this has been taken into account in curriculums widely but too often ESD education is considered as an \u2018add on\u2019. Instead it should be a natural and essential part of school culture in order to educate students towards a sustainable way of life. In this project - the different dimensions of school culture are explored in an international context - the school culture of every project school as well as the skills and pedagogy of the staff is developed- -the general guidelines for school are composed in order to become better ESD school. In analyzing the school culture we will use Schoen\u2019s model (2005), which divides school culture into four key dimensions: 1) professional orientation, 2) organizational structure (leadership and management), 3) teaching and learning, 4) student-orientated activities. Each project meeting will focus on one of these areas and school-specific developmental work will be created. The purpose of the developmental work is to create a school culture that enables and promotes ESD in schools. The Final output of the project will be the guidebook called \u2018A Roadmap to an ESD School\u2019. This book will provide clear and achievable guidance on how to embed the principles and practice of ESD into everyday school culture across Europe.There are four schools taking part in this project, from Finland, Great Britain, Iceland and Belgium. Each of the selected partner schools has been committed to ESD for many years and is well known for this work within their local communities. Each partner school has been selected for the strengths and expertise it has in specific areas of ESD.  Each school has engaged a complimentary specialist external partner with a remit to promote ESD. The partner organisations will provide expertise to support the implementation of the planned Erasmus project and will work with schools for the duration of the project.The project will be implemented in schools at three levels: management level, teacher level and student level. The project work will be informed by a rigorous survey cycle, including an initial and final survey. Surveys will involve a range of stakeholders including students and parents and will be used to inform action plans and measure impact of work done. School managers will be responsible for implementing action plans during the development cycle of the project, teachers will be trained to deliver comprehensive ESD education, and students will participate in ESD education and share their experiences with other project schools. There will be one project meeting arranged in every project country and the final meeting is arranged by the coordinator. Alongside and to successfully implement this work, there will be four international teacher training courses. Professional development for teachers will be arranged in the project countries.
