Considering the local situation in Cyprus, as a small island economy, new jobs will not be created in the Public Sector and if they are, then they are generally unsustainable, so the way out of the current situation will depend on entrepreneurship, including social entrepreneurship .  Young people also have fewer opportunities in the job market, as traditionally within the Cypriot economy, older and more experienced employees always have an advantage over less experienced younger counterparts, and retired people also start their own businesses after retirement, further limiting the chances of the youth.  This situation is applicable to rest of the Europe as well.\r\nThe objective of the project is to tackle youth unemployment across the EU through innovative solutions including social entrepreneurship, and raising awareness on youth unemployment.  This project also aims to ensure equal access to employment across the society, particularly among young people through equipping them with relevant skills.\r\nThe objectives are as below:\r\n-Raising awareness about social problems\r\n-Gaining knowledge regarding social entrepreneurship \r\n-Introducing tools regarding how social enterprises tackle societal problems\r\n-To motivate youth workers in order to undertake and utilise social enterpreneurship as a force for social change\r\n-To introduce necessary tools to youth workers on how to find innovative ways of tackling social problems\r\n-To develop pilot projects which address social challenges in their organisations or community \r\n-Equipping youth workers with the relevant skills of how they can cope with social problems in their society \r\nThere will be 30 participants, aged 18-35 years old.  The main target group is youth workers working with young people who are currently excluded from the job market as well as the wider society.  The need of these young people is not only to be employed for financial independence, security and self-esteem, but also to be empowered to make their voices heard in the society and be equipped with the right skills needed for the current job market.  Once empowered, young people can lobby more effectively for their own needs. \r\nThe activities and the methodology used will be as follows.  \r\nPreparation phase: July/August 2014\r\nPreparation for the course \u2013 distance learning: Aug/Sep 2014\r\nResidential training course: September 2014\r\nFollow-up to the course \u2013 distance learning: Oct 2014\r\nFinal evaluation and follow-up:  Nov 2014\r\nThe \u201cSESC \u201d training course is composed of two learning components: distance learning and residential training course.\r\nDistance learning, both preparation and follow-up phase, will be based on online interactive training units, which would focus on introduction of learning materials concerning the theme of the project, online discussions, self-reflection, mentoring and support from the training team and partner organisations involved. The important part of the preparation phase will be the research conducted by youth workers, with the support of their organisations, about the employability of young people and demands of job markets in their countries. \r\nResidential training course on the other hand will be implemented using a whole range of non-formal educational methods, such as: self-reflection, brainstorming, case studies, inventories, outdoor activities, presentations, role-plays, simulation games, and many others.\r\nEarly training in entrepreneurship and encouraging the enterprise spirit is one of the keys the European Union has identified to creating jobs, improving competitiveness and stimulating economic growth. It is crucial to creating sustainable and vibrant communities where young people\u2019s livelihoods can grow and thrive.

Seeing the problems, they want things to change and have chance to contribute to that process. However most of the time decision making structures fail in providing support for this kind of youth active citizenship and leadership. Youth as an active group in society can and should be active citizens and play a vital role in development of their respective communities based on principles of democratic societies.\r\n\r\nActive citizenship is a process of becoming responsible for one\u2019s surrounding, for other individuals and for society in which we live. This responsibility can take many shapes and forms. It is not responsibility which one can or should be forced to accept but one which young people freely choose to engage in. It is voluntarily commitment to the development of a society and tackling \u2018global\u2019 problems on local level. As have been mentioned above, many young people have desires, passions and will to participate and to act for betterment of society as a whole.

Since then, our school has participated in consecutive international experiences.\r\nIn 2009, we started the progressive introduction of a Bilingual Programme in English in Secondary Education following CLIL methodology and, since 2014, we have extended this Linguistic Programme to 'Bachillerato'. This year we have applied for the implementation of another Linguistic Programme in French for Secondary Education and it is now confirmed and due to start in September 2015.\r\nOn the other hand, the Careers Department of our school is developing programmes to support students who have not fully dropped out of school, analyzing early school leaving and proposing actions to correct this current situation.\r\nDue to the fact that our school is fully open to innovation as well as our previous experience, this new framework proposed by the European Union through Erasmus+ assures the continuity of social inclusion of our students and the development of full European citizenship.\r\n\r\n2.

We will try to get better results in: early school leaving, students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 motivation and inclusion of students with Special Needs (SEN).\r\nThese new methodological strategies we want to develop point directly to a loss of prominence of teachers in the classrooms, changing their role to someone who guides and strengthens students\u2019 motivation to learn, while students investigate and share the results with their partners.\r\n\r\n6. Long-Term Benefits.\r\nThe change for the better in this new methodological strategy will undoubtedly make students more interested in taking part in the Bilingual Programmes already successfully established in our school.

This LLP provides our interns with financial support to help lower the overall cost for their families.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are that the students can acquire the skills and abilities expected by the economy. In dealing with him/herself: self-esteem, self-confidence, a sense of basic trust, appreciation, self-efficacy, introspection, self-responsibility, and self-discipline. In dealing with others: attention, appreciation, empathy, ability to comprise, insight into human nature, ability to take criticism, awareness, tolerance, respect, language competence (especially in the foreign language), and intercultural competence. In regards to teamwork: ability to work in a team, cooperation, motivation, ability to confront conflicts, communication skills, and also general skills and abilities such as responsibility, diligence, flexibility and commitment.\r\n\r\nThis year we will be dispatching 32 students to partner companies in England, Italy and Spain.  Students will not only get their first professional experiences in an international environment, but also be able to apply their specialized practical knowledge along with their specialized theoretical knowledge.  Third year students know that they will not only be learning how businesses operate in other countries.  As interns, they must also learn other aspects of the work environment including managing to communicate with coworkers and superiors in a foreign language as well as taking care of guests in a multilingual environment.  The practical, linguistic, and social skills acquired by our students are very important for school but more so for their future professional careers.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the preparedness and quality of the internship, there is a monitoring system during the entire preparatory phase and also during the time abroad through E-mail and/or telephone.  The supervisors are also very important during the internship.  Through personal contact with the tutors and guest organisations, we can improve the quality of the job positions provided to our students.  At our school, we support our interns through monthly meetings.  The team of teachers in charge also meet with students in their free time.  During the holidays, teachers stay in touch with our interns and are accessible through E-mail and cellphones.  The interns will be prepared together by the HBLW Saalfelden\u2019s trained team of teachers, which the program coordinator, Birgit Tatzreiter, is accountable for.  In addition to information sessions at the school, participants will also gather useful knowledge for their internships in school subjects such as \u201cInternational Communication in Business\u201d and \u201cCooking;\u201d furthermore, students have the opportunity to attend a seminar titled \u201cContent and Language Integrated Learning.\u201d\r\nThe results we expect from these internships are not limited to good grades on the preliminary exam for matriculation (Vorpr\u00fcfung), but also include a significant improvement in our students\u2019 language skills.  Additionally, we hope our students gain flexibility, independence, and other advantages to separate them from their competition in the job market.

Traveling, especially abroad or to a place we have never been before, allows us to temporarily leave our old life behind and adopt new customs, new ways of thinking and looking at the world, ways that can crossover into our everyday lives.\r\nOn the other hand, musculoskeletal conditions are a leading cause of burden and disease across the EU Member States. Europe\u2019s ageing population and changes in lifestyle suggest that without action the burden of these conditions will increase. Health and fitness professionals are now noticing a decrease in the physical functionality of their participant and are beginning to address it. The continual decrease in everyday activity has contributed too many of the postural deficiencies seen in people. Therefore, today\u2019s training programs cannot stay the same as programs of the past. In other words, the programs must consider each person, their environment, their eating habits, their psychological mood and the specific exercise design that will be performed in order to prevent them from diseases and to improve their musculoskeletal functionality.\r\nObjectives of the project: The GO Functional Improvement & Tourism (GO FIT) project addresses the gap in learning programs between HEI\u2019s exercise and health experts with both educational and clinical expertise, in collaboration with tourism specialists. So, the GO FIT project is designed to develop a new learning program, a web platform and a multimedia application with transdisciplinary approach for exercise, health and tourism experts, to achieve relevant and high quality skills and competences in designing the appropriate program for tourists and helping them to adopt a new healthy lifestyle. \r\nSpecifically during the activities of the project: \r\nA total of 6 exercise and health specialists (6 exercise experts -2 physical therapists between them) 2 physicians (across GER, GR, NOR and CY) with significant impact on each individual learner will collaborate with another HEI and one non-profit organization with impact on hotel industry (TEIA, ALBA) and policy makers (ALBA) through Joint Staff Training Event. The project contributes to co-operation within and between a variety of professionals (physicians, exercise experts, counseling) connecting practices from different thematic areas to impact diffusion at hotel industry (hotel managers and tourists). \r\nThe joint curriculum program that will be developed and piloted will be incorporated to the existent curriculum of three HEIs in three different countries, with calculated ECTS as a grading scale.\r\nThe 30 learners-participants in the Pilot of the curriculum (ISP and long-term distance teaching) (10 students for each partner organization) will impact on others via a cascade effect of spreading knowledge and learning gained through the program. In this way there will be significant impact on exercise specialists employment in the participating hotels and thus employment across the EU. \r\nSimilarly, 100 tourists who will use the multimedia application will impact on their colleagues (indirect target group) spreading education and well-being gained through their short participation in the program. \r\nManagers, HR members and Corporate Social Responsibility of 100 hotel industry and enterprises from the public sector will acknowledge that the healthier option is the easier option through the Information Day (Dissemination). A well informed public opinion in combination with the provision of condensed and easily accessible information for all kinds of audiences would lower health costs and foster productivity and work satisfaction of office employees. Easy public access will also bring a wide collection of \u2018popularized\u2019 functional exercise information closer to information seekers (tourist, public), while the wide dissemination of GO FIT results will contribute towards a better understanding of GO FIT program potential.\r\nThe potential longer term benefits: GO FIT project is expected to have a long lasting impact on the wide dissemination of GO FIT protocol and its integration to tourists and eventually to any participant everyday lives. Rising awareness hotel industry managers and  CSR and HR members on the serious social impact of musculoskeletal disorders and their socioeconomic consequences, the project expects believe there will be an increase in kinetic system functionality and a healthy lifestyle adoption. By educating tourists and all participants in following the GO FIT protocol in their lives, the project aims to instill them that the healthier option is the easier option and at the same time to address the most frequent problems related to kinetic system decreased functionality.", "http://www.uos.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-EL01-KA203-036131_1"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["5SW", "RQ8", "Nuffield Ipswich Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP4"}
