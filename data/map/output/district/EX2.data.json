They commercialise small volumes of low-emission vehicles, including taxis, delivery vans, factory vehicles and domestic cars. However with current technologies their market is limited and their development has been split between low-cost mass market and expensive high-performance vehicles. These vehicles do not meet customer performance demands, at a price point which is competitive with IC engines. Large vehicle manufacturers overcome this gap and reduce their development costs by platform sharing component technologies. However due to the lack of collaboration within our industry, this platform technology is not available. This proposal addresses this technology gap though the development of an open platform power management system, with customisable performance and efficiency. The platform will be supported by a modular platform drive motor topology, based on a fully scalable axial flux design (100Nm to 1,200Nm cont. torque). The low cost technology will be sufficiently high torque to drive the wheels at a high speed, without requiring an intermediate gearbox. To further drive down cost we will use the housing of the liquid cooled drive motor, as a heat sink for a high current power convertor. This will be achieved by applying a circuit board directly onto the motor housing, using a thermal spraying technology. The project will benefit Europe through increased sales of low-emission vehicles and enable our members to reduce development time by 20% and component cost by 40%. The modular drive motor platform will enable our members to manufacturer desirable vehicles at a competitive price and reduce the total vehicle cost by up to 13%. In addition we will offset imports by EU manufacturing of new drive motors, increasing European revenues by \u20ac257 million and profits by \u20ac51 million.", 17138.0, 2604557.0, "SAFEDRIVE", "New motors to boost electric and hybrid cars", "An initiative to advance and unify drivetrain technology for electric and hybrid cars could help European businesses in the field significantly. It will also bring the continent closer to a greener land transport model.", "About 1\u00a0600 European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), mostly automotive industry manufacturers and suppliers, are working on developing cutting-edge hybrid, electric and fuel cell technology for vehicles. These businesses face many challenges, particularly since there is no common drivetrain platform for applications under development, giving an advantage to larger multinational vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'A platform power management system and low voltage drive train for hybrid and electric vehicles' (http://www.safedrive-fp7.eu (SAFEDRIVE)) supported European SME electric vehicle manufacturers in penetrating the electric vehicle market. It worked on developing a scalable, modular electric drivetrain to suit different types of electric and hybrid vehicles such as small cars, trucks and utility vehicles.\n\nEnvisioning a new motor design that requires lowering the voltage of direct current (DC) systems, SAFEDRIVE worked on a new split-Pi DC-to-DC converter and a power management/distribution system. The modular DC motor would eliminate the need for a gearbox, enabling direct drive operation through a drive shaft or as a hub motor. The project team developed an efficient bi-directional DC-to-DC converter in the drivetrain between the modular motors and power sources (super capacitor, lithium-ion batteries, motor-generator set).\n\nTo achieve its aims, SAFEDRIVE brought together SME supply chain partners, associations and end-users from across Europe. The project partners investigated existing technologies and developed the software behind the control and power management of the drivetrain. This was followed by production of new circuit boards, design of the drivetrain component parts and integration into a prototype.\n\nTowards the end of the project the team was very close to completing a fully functional electric vehicle drivetrain with an innovative modular DC motor that produces the desired torque. All the project's results have been disseminated to stakeholders, laying the groundwork for a unified drivetrain that could boost SME results in the field. Thanks to this initiative, Europe has come one step closer to becoming a leader in producing cleaner vehicles.", null, "http://www.scimar.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813112212.jpg", "fp7_95937_991906093"], ["7HY", "Enabling access to geological information in support of GMES", "Landmark Information Group", "PanGeo is a service proposed in response to FP7 GMES Downstream Call 3 (released July 2009).

Upon user enquiry, a PanGeo web-portal will automatically integrate the geohazard data with the Urban Atlas to highlight the polygons influenced.

Yet, information about geohazards and their effects can be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. EU-funded scientists looked to Copernicus, the European Earth observation programme (formerly named Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES), to generate information on natural and man-made geohazards.\n\nThe 'Enabling access to geological information in support of GMES' (http://www.pangeoproject.eu/ (PANGEO)) project was initiated with the goal to enable free and open access to geohazard information through Copernicus. This was achieved by developing an online geohazard information service for the two largest towns in each EU Member State.\n\nWith the exception of Cyprus and Luxembourg, where information is provided for one city only, the PANGEO service covers about 13\u00a0% of the EU's population. The information includes two geohazard data products: a new ground stability layer and accompanying interpretation that are produced by 27 national geological surveys.\n\nThe surveys use their geohazard information in combination with measurements of terrain motion supplied by satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radars. Urban maps are supplied after integrating land-cover and land-use data from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Services. The PANGEO data can be viewed on the project website and in Google Earth.\n\nUpon user enquiry for a given town, the service automatically integrates the ground stability layer with corresponding data from the Copernicus Urban Atlas at a resolution of 2.5\u00a0metres. The PANGEO service is entirely free to use and the data products downloadable (as PDF files) to enable integration into the user's geographic information system.\n\nThis wealth of information is targeted at local authorities, civil protection agencies, insurers, businesses and interested members of the general public. For example, local authority planners and regulators can now make more informed decisions on spatial planning in areas of instability. Governments can take remedial action in geologically susceptible zones to avoid high costs from possible disaster.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of the PANGEO service, additional European towns that the Urban Atlas will cover can join the online system, once all the datasets are available.

We also think that the new materials and applications that could be developed would be very important.  \r\n\r\nThe 12 teachers who would participate in this project have been organized into 3 teams , one for each level -kindergarden, primary and secondary).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur main objectives are :\r\n\r\n1. Acquiring language and teaching skills that would benefit each level in school.\r\n\r\n2 . Observing the teaching methodologies within a British school.\r\n\r\n3 . Improving the English skills within our school, whilst integrating the language into different subjects such as Art and ICT.\r\n\r\n4 . Produce materials which will improve the language skills of our students .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach team of teachers will carry out the following activites / courses in order to achieve the above goals: \r\n\r\n-  methodology courses.\r\n\r\n-  Refresh English courses.\r\n\r\n-  CLIL courses.\r\n\r\n-  Job shadowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe participants are dynamic , participatory , and employ innovative ICT techniques in education. They are also committed to the european project, and our enthusiastic and eager to carry out the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n 1. A group of teachers will attend English courses to improve their level. The courses will be about CLIL in Sciences, ICT and Maths. Allowing the teachers to improve their English, whilst inspiring them to employ innovative methods in their English teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Another group of teachers will go to \"Birdwell School\" to observe the teaching techniques. We may incorporate the different styles into our school to develop our English teaching. The aim is to achieve new methodology, materials and ideas to introduce them in linguistic and non linguistic subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. All the teachers who participate in the project will develop their English and materials, in order teach some subjects in English. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT\r\n\r\na. To learn and to hopefully implement cooperative work in the future.\r\n\r\nb. To belong to a mobility program, so we can open future opportunities and projects.\r\n\r\nc. To improve and refresh the English level, written and oral.\r\n\r\nd. To get innovative ideas and techniques to motivate the students in the English lessons as well as in the other subjects that will be taught in English.\r\n\r\ne. To discover more resources and activities to prepare, design and evaluate new English materials (CLIL). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE RESULTS, IMPACT AND POSSIBLE LONG TERM BENEFITS. \r\n\r\na.

In order to succeed, an experimental project has been set up and aims to award schools an academic label called \u201cEuropean School\u201d. The schools involved in this project must develop activities which open the pupils european outlook; encourage them to take part in trips and study programs of all types but also allow each pupil to attend non-linguistic lessons taught partly in a foreign language. The main aim is to give pupils as many possibilities to use the English language in different subjects and projects as well as the language course itself, thus allowing them to acquire the necessary skills for their future life as an European citizen. The setting up of this experiment involves proposing a series of training programs to the involved staff. The consortium is made up of 16 schools for this particular mobility program, all of which are part of the European school project. Thus, in the 2 years of the project, 141 participants will be able to carry out a mobility in England by attending organised lessons, adapted to the specific needs of each participant and/or a shadowing period in a European partner school. It principally concerns teachers of non-language subjects who wish to improve their English language skills but there are also language teachers, management and administrative staff who have been picked for their specific training needs.  Each person has been selected on the basis of specific criteria which have been defined by the Academy: committment to innovation, willingness to train in order to develop their skills and the committment to partake in a training program which not only includes an European mobility but also includes preparatory activities and the use of their new skills as part of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe training program is based on a diagnostical evaluation of the linguistic capacities of the participants and defines the training activities which will take place before, during and after their mobility. The skills to be learnt and the way they will be used in a pedagogical approach are specified. The Europass language passport constitutes the instrument of measure of the training program, underlined in a mobility contract binding each of the different persons (the Local Education Authority, the participating school, and the training college or partner school). Except for our English teachers, the language skills of our trainees will be attested either by the \u201cDCL\u201d (which is a national professional diploma giving a level of the European Framework of Reference for Languages) or by the \u201cCertification compl\u00e9mentaire\u201d which certifies a recognised level of language skills in order to teach a non-linguistic subject in English.

Their acquired skills will lead to their success and improve their personal development and their employability on the national, European and international job market.\r\n\r\nThe trainees will be able to improve their English skills and the quality of their teaching in terms of language, culture and educational methods.

Within the last four years, 25 staff members (among whom our Deputy Head and our fund manager) and 59 pupils belonging to every professional section have taken part in mobility projects involving three different host counties: Great-Britain, Spain and Sweden.\r\nThe aim of our project is to make our school, Isnelle Amelin, become an  International Vocational School by 2017.\r\nBy then, our training offer should be supplemented by the opening of  post- A -level sections (BTS : French equivalent of British HND) in order to supply our students with a European Vocational Curriculum.\r\nWith a view to do so, we are putting forward a project which appears perfectly balanced and which entirely answers our requirements:\r\nThe aim of our Erasmus+ project is to train our staff on a large scale (15% of them).\r\nThus, we shall offer 16 staff members the possibility to improve their linguistic and pedagogic skills, as well as to open themselves to a European professional environment.\r\nThe staff members concerned will be the following ones :  1 member of the direction team, 1 member of the school administration office and 14 teachers (among whom 8 teaching professional subjects, 3 colleagues of general education subjects and 3 language teachers).\r\nAll this with a view to: \r\n- improve linguistic skills \r\n-and for our human resources to acquire more expertise in managing projects leading to virtual or real mobility schemes. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, we shall implement around 90 mobility schemes for pupils (that is an 90% increase compared to our current Leonardo project). These mobility schemes will revolve around three main lines : \r\n- The professionnal line (involving 4 weeks of work placement in a host company leading to a qualification) which will be recognised with the Europass diploma.\r\n- The cultural line (which will be taken care of through a complete immersion for the students within host families, a programme of organised tours of the Capital City of the host country and of the host area as well as a programme of cultural exchanges with young Europeans through sports and recreational activities).\r\n- The linguistic aspect (accommodation in host families which will give the opportunity of sharing daily activities with them, a specific linguistic training aiming at mobility will be implemented, this training will hinge upon DNL courses (Non linguistic courses, that is various subjects taught in a foreign language). There will also be a diploma given when a mobility project is achieved and a training provided to prepare the European certificate for the A-level).\r\nThe pupils which will take part in this programme will be volunteers coming from every section of our education offer.

They will also enhance our capacity of managing projects.\r\nThe change is also bound to be brought about by the pupils taking part in the programmes since they will stand as examples able to favour a new positive dynamic among the entire pupil community of the school.\r\nWe expect that the international experience gained through these programmes will entail new relationships between pupils, teachers and members of the school direction.

The \u201cHerigoyen-Schule\u201d \u2013 being a bilingual primary school and focusing on improvement of media abilities \u2013 is in a unique situation, it will also work on the following areas of development \u201cteaching foreign languages and learning them\u201d and \u201cnew technologies, digital competences\u201d.\r\n\r\nProject objectives:\r\nThe improvement of linguistic and professional expertise of the teachers teaching the bilingual English classes is a crucial aim at \u201cHerigoyen-Schule\u201d. The contact with other European teachers and their exchange of professional views plus getting to know other cultural environments will widen the teachers\u00b4 horizons and improve the quality of their lessons. With this Erasmus project teachers will be enabled to teach their pupils how to attain knowledge in a modern way and how to learn to be critical while using modern technologies and media.\r\nMaking use of the knowledge of other European countries the following objectives shall be achieved in the shared area of development:\r\n\u2022 strengthening of the school administration\u00b4s process management,\r\n\u2022 optimization of existing curricula regarding individual support and social learning,\r\n\u2022 multiplication of the acquired knowledge on the level of supervisory school authority as well as the transfer of knowledge and new skills to local schools.\r\n\r\nProfile of participants:\r\nThe participants possess above-average qualifications and a comprehensive knowledge of their fields. They will disseminate the competences resulting from the project in their respective development areas and share them by means of school internal teacher training.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nThe choice of courses was made due to the individual needs and knowledge of the participants and differs in length and level. The language courses are offered by certified language schools situated in English-speaking countries employing highly qualified staff. The job-shadowing will be a useful addition.\r\n\r\nThe course in new media follows contemporary teaching and learning trends. It takes into account the fast development in the area of multimedia and provides a future-oriented European platform for a profitable exchange of views.\r\nThe well structured and moderated  exchange of views during the stay in Sweden and South Tyrol includes a visit to several educational institutions and allows the participants to observe and learn how inclusive and social learning is carried out in other European schools and educational institutions.\r\n\r\nApproaches for the implementation of the project:\r\nThe participants\u00b4 tasks will be defined in the groups responsible for the areas of development. Newly acquired experiences and knowledge  will be gathered in these groups, documented and finally passed to the control group in charge. The supervisory school authority will coordinate the entire project in close cooperation with the control group.\r\n\r\nIntended results and long-term benefits:\r\nTo learn about other educational systems and cultural environments will widen the teacher\u00b4s points of view especially regarding the described areas of development. Acquired knowledge will be used in their daily lessons und will effectively improve the quality of their teaching. Organisational structures will be reassessed and optimized. The final report will be collectively written and will be accessible for all schools in the area. It will guarantee the transfer of knowledge at the level of supervisory school authority. \r\nContacting other European partners will profoundly promote the networking and collaboration of schools and support a kind of learning from and within Europe.", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-DE03-KA101-034939_6"], ["4DG", "La R\u00e9union des ambitions professionnelles gr\u00e2ce au levier des mobilit\u00e9s europ\u00e9ennes", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 202057.0, "Very recently, we have successfully applied for our ERASMUS+ project 2015. This has strengthened  our motivation to apply this year for an ambitious project which will benefit our pupils.We do also participate in the Reunion Island project through the regional education office's consortium.Our school has regularly been involved in LEONARDO and COMENIUS projects and thus we have been able to develop some expertise in the field of European mobility. Within the last four years, 25 staff members (including our Deputy Head and our fund manager) and 59 pupils from different vocational paths have taken part in mobility projects involving three different host countries: England, Spain and Sweden.The aim of our project is to make our school, Isnelle Amelin, an International Vocational School by 2017.To meet this goal, our training offer will be completed by 2017 with the opening of post-A Level diplomas; we will first launch a Higher National Diploma in Esthetics, Cosmetics and Fragrances - with a Management option.By then, our training offer should be supplemented by the opening of post- A -level sections (BTS : French equivalent of British HND) in order to supply our students with a European Vocational Curriculum.To achieve this goal, we are proposing a project which is well-rounded and which entirely meets our requirements:The aim of our Erasmus+ project is to train our staff on a large scale (15% of them).Thus, we shall offer 12 staff members the possibility to improve their linguistic and teaching skills, as well as to become part of a European professional environment.The staff members concerned will be the following:  1 member of the administrative team, 2 of the school office and 9 teachers (among whom 5 vocational teachers, 2 colleagues teaching general education subjects and 2 language teachers).The goal of this project being: -to improve linguistic skills -for our human resources, to gain more experience in managing projects leading to virtual or real mobility schemes. At the same time, we shall implement around 70 mobility schemes for pupils (that is a 50% increase compared to the Leonardo project 2013-2015). These mobility schemes will revolve around three main points: - The vocational dimension (involving 4 weeks of work placement) which will be recognized with the Europass diploma.- The cultural dimension (which will consist of a complete immersion of the students within host families, a programme of organised tours around the Capital City  and around the host area). The pupils taking part  will be volunteers coming from every pathway that our establishment offers. This project will be a long-term (spanning 2 school years). Most of the pupils involved will be the ones benefiting from state grants and who, before this project , would have had no opportunity to face any other environment than the one in which they evolve, Reunion Island.- The linguistic aspect  : a subject-specific language training which will hinge upon CLIL courses A diploma will also be awarded at the completion of the mobility project.Through these mobility schemes at the European level, we shall endeavour to develop and improve our pedagogic habits. These improvements will then undoubtedly benefit the entire teaching community and will bring about a positive impact on our daily teaching performances. They will also enhance our ability to manage projects.The change will also be brought about by the pupils taking part in the programmes since they will stand as examples of a new positive dynamic for their fellow students in the school.We expect that the international experience gained through these programmes will entail new relationships between pupils, teachers and the school administration. This experience will also be used as a tool to make pupils more aware of their responsibilities and improve their autonomy ;  it will help to the redesign of assessment tools as well, and will better prepare  our students for the working world.The staff members and pupils who will have been attending these trainings will undoubtedly be opened to new habits, and will contribute to improving the following areas:- increasing the number of pupils passing their vocational diplomas,- bettering the integration of our graduates within their workplaces,- enlarging the possibilities for our future students to work abroad after passing their A-levels.- giving the students real world context for their training- producing among all the pupils a healthy competition revolving around European projects including real or virtual mobility schemes (such as eTwinning for instance)- involving our school into future European projects by signing partnership contracts with the schools hosting our mobility schemes,- enhancing both the motivation and skills of our teams,- contributing to the attractiveness of our pathways- boosting the popularity of our school on the academic level- improving the image of Reunion Island througout Europe", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-022865_3"], ["4DG", "Szakmai \u00e9s m\u00f3dszertani tud\u00e1sb\u0151v\u00edt\u00e9s RMG_KA1_2017", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 23438.0, "Radn\u00f3ti Mikl\u00f3s Secondary Grammar School has been a significant talent mentoring workshop of the Southern Great Plain region of Hungary since its foundation in 1898.

The project will end in June 2017 drawing into its wake two schools which did not belong to the first consortium but were, nevertheless, already proactive in their international links. \r\nIn order to respond to an ambitious goal presented in the second line of research of the academic project, which is to develop our students\u2019 competency in oral communication skills in a foreign language, the six schools are committed not only to promoting all actions that lead to opening up Europe and the virtual and physical mobility of their students but also to allowing each student to take full advantage of studying other non-linguistic subjects partly in the target language. The aim is not only to improve students\u2019 linguistic competency but equally to allow the acquisition of the competencies and skills necessary for their everyday life as young European citizens.\r\nTo this end, the actions of the consortium meet fully the national and academic priorities.\r\nEffectively, putting the \u201cEuropean Schools Project\u201d into place implies offering training facilities for the staff participating in the project. During the two years of the project, 83 members of staff will be able to travel to England, Spain and Germany within the framework of a structured and customised timetable and eight teachers will follow an observation course in a European partner school. This will concern mainly teachers of non-linguistic subjects who wish to develop their competency in a foreign language. Teachers of modern languages, heads of schools and administrative staff have also been chosen according to their training needs.\r\nParticipants have been selected on the basis of jointly defined criteria. The first one is the commitment to developing actions encouraging an open attitude towards the international scene and lessons in DNL (non-linguistic subject) given in a foreign language within their school. The second one is the commitment to enrolling in a training programme, not limited to mobility, but also including preparatory activities which are then put into practice with their newly acquired skills within the framework of an accredited European School. \r\nThe training programme is based on a diagnostic assessment of the linguistic skills of the trainees and defines the training activities which will take place pre, during and post course and states the expected linguistic acquisition and the ways in which it will relate to the teaching methods used in the classroom. The European Language Passport is the tool which states their track record as defined within the framework of a mobility contract between all committed parties that is: the school sending the trainee, the host school and the trainees themselves.\r\nAll members of staff (except language teachers) will be evaluated at the end of the training programme by the DCL (a professional diploma assessing the linguistic level obtained according to the CECRL) and teachers who wish will be able to enrol and take a complementary certificate in \u201cTeaching a Non-Linguistic Subject in English\u201d. The follow up will be undertaken by the steering committee of the consortium.\r\nIn responding to the training needs of teachers, this project will allow them to improve their language skills and the quality of the linguistic, cultural and pedagogic services they offer. Hence, on return from their course, staff will be able to make a dynamic contribution to cultural actions aimed at opening up their school internationally. In this way, the links created with foreign partners will facilitate new networks of European contacts and will help develop new partnerships.\r\nThe expected benefits to students, by increasing the time they are exposed to the target language, will be to reach a level in modern languages sufficient for communication purposes. The competencies thus acquired will enhance the success of young people from Haute Marne and improve their personal development and their employment potential on the European and international market.\r\nIn improving the abilities of each player in this project, the \u201cmobility programme\u201d will add to the international dimension of the school, which will be recognised by the ongoing academic accreditation of a \u201cEuropean School\u201d and educational recognition for the standard of teaching in the area of Chaumont-Langres.\r\nFinally, the common policy of the schools in this consortium will contribute to lowering students\u2019 failure rate and will increase the percentage of university graduates coming from this area.

The families and students who belong to this area are generally very attached to their territory, which might sometimes constitute an impediment to thinking of mobility as a tool of success, particularly if it must be on such a large scale as that of Europe. Besides, the socio-professional profile of our area is predominantly composed of manual workers and economically non-active people, a situation which is often related to a difficulty for student in developing a successful and ambitious educational progress, taking into account high-achievement training possibilities and current and future opportunities of mobility. \r\nOne of our major missions is to broaden the horizons for the actors of the educational chain in our school. In this perspective, we do our best to provide our staff with the best possible opportunities of international development and outlook, while always bearing in mind a central concern of both our school, our academy, our country and Europe: preventing young people from dropping out of the school system. This great theme develops many a question that we want to address: how should we tackle the growing heterogeneity of our students? How do we implement differentiated instruction? How do we consider the continuity between high-school education and higher education? How do we help our students to develop their ambition and create their own success in higher education and their professional life? \r\nWe hope to enrol different profiles of staff in this mobility project. Some may need linguistic reinforcement and CLIL-oriented training in order to improve their CLIL teaching or so they may take the CLIL certification. Some staff may need specific training on the questions related to the prevention of students dropping out of education. Taking courses in foreign countries and in foreign languages will both open their eyes to other cultural approaches of the question and improve their linguistic and intercultural skills. Some staff may want to get involved in the already-existing relationship with European partners along collaboratively organised programmes and thus increase our European mutualisation and cooperation. As a consequence, our multiple objectives towards improving our students\u2019 opportunities will have the best chances of being met. \r\nWith these mobilities, we hope to improve the quality of the existing CLIL offer, to develop the CLIL offer towards new profiles of students who do not yet see how they could get involved in a European education process. We hope to improve the pedagogical and educational skills of the staff in relation with the objectives announced in our Plan for European Development.

Hopefully, in the longer run, more students will be involved in European Sections. The students who are not involved in European Education will still benefit from the results of the project, particularly if their integration in the school system raises questions, through an improvement of how their teachers and educators tackle the problem. Indeed the scope of the mobilities will reach far beyond the staff members who will have benefitted from them directly. The latter will share their new knowledge and skill with their peers, through devices set up by the school, like intern training sessions or conferences.

Most of the large companies in the area have disappeared, leading many small businesses to close down as well, causing a tsunami effect. As a result of that, we can find  many unemployed low-skilled people with little chance of finding a job. Many of them are looking forward  to improving their situation and some are enrolled in the Administrative Management Training Course, which is the subject of this Erasmus + Project. The lack of alternatives, the promotion of employment, the promotion of social equity and inclusion are the main factors that have triggered the presentation of this proposal.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nFor the IES Francesc Gil, if this proposal is accepted, it would mean the mobility of 6 students of the 2nd Basic Education course and the Medium-level Training Course in Administrative Management. Regarding the type of mobility of personnel, this would involve the mobility of 3 teachers from the Administration and Management Department of our school.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the host partners:\r\n\r\n- The Lyc\u00e9e Professionnel Notre Dame, in Castres (France).

This center will provide training in CLIL methodology for teaching staff.\r\n- Sprachschule Zum Ehrstein, in Germany, with regard to training in Dual FP (dual vocational courses).\r\n- And as a novelty, St. Caterine High School will provide training in entrepreneurship through Job-Shadowing and the creation of materials. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIVITIES:\r\n\r\nWithin the period of validity of the project there will be two truns of students mobility, consisting each of 4 weeks of internship and cultural preparation at destination. The first of them  is planned for the 2017/2018 academic year and the second one for the 2018/2019 academic year.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is planned to train a teacher of the Department of Administration and Management of the center in the CLIL methodology for the subsequent teaching of non-linguistic subjects in English. Another mobility of teachers for training in Dual Vocational Training. And also another mobility of teachers through observation or Job-Shadowing with the objective of introducing the knowledge in different subjects and the didactic materials elaborated in English.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED RESULTS:\r\n\r\nIf the students are evaluated with \"pass\", this will result in the partial validation of the FCT (training at workplace) module with the corresponding hours.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it will also be certified with Europass, Youthpass, diploma of language preparation as well as diploma and certificate of the IES Francesc Gil that testify the realization of the students' residency.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the training of the teaching staff, it is expected that during the next two courses (2017/2018 and 2019/2020), non-linguistic modules may be taught in English in the Basic Vocational Training Course and in the Administrative Management Training Course in our school. It is also expected that this will apply to the Plurilingual Program of other courses in our school, IES  Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Dual Vocational Training, it is planned to apply the good practices observed in other countries to the project that is now starting at IES Francesc Gil.\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS:\r\n\r\n- As a differentiating element of the IES Francesc Gil compared to other schools in the area that offer courses of the same professional field, as regards the quality of its offer of FP (vocational training).\r\n\r\n- Promotion of the participation of various social agents of our region involved in issues of Youth and Employment.\r\n\r\n- Dynamic element to enhance the participation in other European projects in the future.\r\n\r\n- Integrating element with the rest of the Educational Community. This project brings together the wishes of the students' parents, the pupils themselves and the public authorities.\r\n\r\n- As a stimulus to the relationships between our School's Management Team and the teachers involved in the project.

The participants will be able to attend English lessons adapted to their levels. Then, it should help them to communicate and exchange with their European partners for their future partnerships.\r\nA second part of the project is to take part in job shadowing, also aimed at teachers and members of the staff. This will allow them to observe teaching methods, to develop their professional skills, to exchange with their European peers and to discover new innovating methods to reproduce in their teaching process but also in the school climate. These activities will be a means of strengthening the existing partnerships and will help to make the multidisciplinary teamwork durable.\r\nThe participants are chosen regarding their motivation and their desire to take part in training actions and to reuse the benefits of their learning process in their teaching and educational practice. They will sign a contract for their mobility which will render their engagement to both take part in the training actions and to use the benefits official. The Europass language passport will be the tool used to follow their process. A diagnostic assessment of their language skills and a language certificate exam (DCL: which is a national professional diploma giving a level of the European Framework of Reference for Languages) at the end of the process will help to assess the progress of the participants that took part in the language lessons. Each school will highlight their participation in the project on their website or on their digital work space, during their Open Day or through communication with the newspapers.\r\nThe participation in this project and in the \u201cEuropean school\u201d label project of the concerned schools will allow the staff to develop their language, educational and cultural skills in order to have the pupils benefit from innovative practices. They will be able to create various European contact networks in order to develop their multidisciplinary teamwork projects. In the medium and long term, the goals are to have a more established European opening in the schools, to improve pupils\u2019 success and to guarantee a better employability for them in the future.

It offers very wide and varying training plans, related to Technical and Professional education. The school is located in an area rather deficient of  structures and services and it represents a strategic reference point  for initiatives aimed at bringing together young people, sharing social life and promoting culture. The school is strongly linked to its territory, deeply integrated in it; conversely, the school community has a lacking awareness of international cooperation and european dimension, although nowadays these aspects are considered essential to valorize an education oriented towards a \"global society\".\r\nOur institute has started a process of renovation of its educational programmes in the direction of a more extended European opening, in order to:\r\n- provide a more intercultural, integrated and motivating approach to the learning process;\r\n- enrich competences in response to modern society perspectives and challenges;\r\n- multiply opportunities to forward the transition from school education to work market.\r\n\r\nOur European Development Plan has identified some strategic areas to be improved through initiatives of broader international issue; this is the background of the project \"C.I.A.O. - Clil and Innovative Approach in our Organization\", which intends to answer to the following problems detected in our institute:\r\n1) Language competences of teachers inadequate to sustain a regular didactic activity based upon CLIL, which is also required by Italian Ministry regulations.\r\n2) Lack of specific competences about the CLIL methodology, also for teachers having adequate language skills.\r\n3) Poor diffusion of active didactic methodologies, alternative to traditional lessons.\r\n4) Weak european openness among the inspiring principles of the organization.\r\n\r\nIn response to these problems, the project \"C.I.A.O.\" objectives are:\r\n1) To reinforce the level of competences in English in our organization.\r\n2) To improve the competences in CLIL, in order to ensure a more capillary and aware usage of this methodology, also in compliance with Ministry regulations.\r\n3) To improve the competences in the usage of active/innovative didactic methodologies, in order to stimulate the most demotivated and little participant students and to reinforce their learning process at school, given the fact that students are less and less willing to study independently at home.\r\n4) To promote cooperation and good practise exchange at an international level, in order to open windows of our school on Europe.\r\n\r\nTo attain these objectives a transnational Mobility Plan will be realized in 7 different European countries, in which 20 teachers and the Headmaster will take part to training activities consisting in STRUCTURED COURSES and JOB SHADOWING experiences. The mobilities will involve: English mother tongue countries (England, Ireland); countries with high level of competence in English (Finland, Sweden); other countries in order to get in touch with as many different cultures as possible (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Spain).\r\nThe structured courses in England, Ireland, Czech Republic and Finland will focus on:\r\n- improvement of English level;\r\n- acquisition of CLIL methodology;\r\n- acquisition of innovative/active didactic methodologies;\r\n- exchange of good practices with European schools and knowledge of other education systems.\r\nThe job-shadowing experiences in Slovakia, Spain and Sweden will focus on:\r\n- observation of lessons of non linguistic subjects held with CLIL in English;\r\n- observation of lessons of English as foreign language;\r\n- observation of lessons based on innovative didactic methodologies, resources and technologies.\r\n\r\nThe teaching staff in our institute, made of 160 teachers, is very stable and consolidated: only 7 teachers (less than 5%) are temporary and more than 50% of teachers have been continously teaching for more than 10 years in the institute. This aspect gives strenght and sustainability to our mobility project: indeed, although the 20 participants constitues only the 13% of the stable teachers, their motivation, awareness and clarity of objectives will make them a driving force able to assure a great extent of diffusion and utilization of the project outcomes in the whole school community, thanks to effective dissemination and continuity actions after project conclusion. \r\nMoreover, the direct participation of Headmaster in the mobility indicates the commitment of our school to open windows towards Europe and to re-consider in a critical way the didactic and organization practises, attempting to renew and modernize the training process.", "http://www.ipcexeter.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047669_5"], ["4DG", "LA FORMULA DELL\u2019INCLUSIONE: una comunit\u00e0 integrata \u00e8 pi\u00f9 grande della somma delle singole persone", "International Projects Centre Ltd", 55462.0, "The Cpia (Provincial Centre for Adult Education) is a public educational institution, which is part of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research.

This area is characterized by a very high youth unemployment rate; in particular, in the municipalities of Medio Campidano there is a higher percentage of NEET compared to the rest of the island. Our institute was founded in 2015 by the unification of five permanent territorial centers and had a new set-up  which favored the entry of tenured teachers with little experience in the field of adult education and especially in intercultural education.  The CPIA welcomes 1601 students of different age groups (from 16 to 80 years), different geographical origin (French-speaking, English-speaking, economic migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors) and different social and cultural level; the majority did not complete compulsory secondary education.\r\nThrough Erasmus Plus, the school aims to improve, update and implement the skills of our teachers and administrative staff, so as to offer activities and programs that better meet  the needs of our potential catchment area and that are able to  intercept those people not yet included in an educational path (NEETs, more fragile and disadvantaged people).\r\nThe specific objectives outlined are:\r\n- Develop welcoming practices to improve the inclusion and integration of community and non-EU students;\r\n- Improve the competence of teachers and staff in English and French;\r\n- Implement innovative methodologies, such as CLIL, particularly suitable for a multicultural context;\r\n- Strengthen the European and international dimension of the institution;\r\n- Improve the use of ICT to broaden methodological resources and access to training, including the use of distance learning platforms;\r\n- Implement the skills of English language teachers involved in preparing students for certifications at European level.\r\n\r\nThe initiative involves many of the permanent staff members, some of whom are key figures of the institute's management.\r\nThe number of mobility required is 25 and involves a collaborator of the headmaster with decades of experience in adult education, two members  of the school commission for the training and updating of the staff, for the PTOF area and for relations with the territory; teachers of L2; teachers of secondary education; an administrative assistant.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the objectives outlined, the project proposes the following activities:\r\n- A Job Shadowing in Belgium that will allow observing and importing best practices regarding the management of adult education, welcoming migrants, teaching methodologies in multicultural classes;\r\n- Structured courses  in Great Britain and France on English language skills, on French language skills, on CLIL methodology,  on the use of ICT and the Moodle platform for distance learning, on migrants' integration and inclusion practices.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to have the following impact:\r\n - better language skills for the staff ;\r\n- an implementation of teaching and digital skills of teachers and the ability to respond to the individual needs of learners with their social, cultural and linguistic diversity.\r\n- a growth of knowledge and skills in an international dimension that will increase the teachers' self - esteem with positive effects on the school.\r\n - an improvement in the integration and inclusion of all students, especially those from outside the EU;\r\n-  the opportunity for students to build a knowledge and an intercultural vision together with the teachers, as well as a multi-linguistic mentality through the CLIL methodology which will contribute to increasing the motivation and opportunities for learning a foreign language;\r\n- the opportunity for students to certify the competences acquired in class through the achievement of certifications recognized at national and international level .\r\n- greater openness to schools from other countries and to a European dimension.\r\nThe long-term goal is to create a community of teachers at national and European level that can exchange  best practices and train each other by sharing their skills.

It is the first project of its type to do this. It utilizes a  recently devised method for this process - Transformative Evaluation (TE) - which in the UK context has been shown to both significantly develop youth worker's ability to demonstrate impact, re-engage youth workers in the evaluation process and develop high quality youth work. It focuses on 'story generation' and starts with the voice of young people. This is enhanced through a process of peer and stake holder discussions to establish definitely the impact of youth work in that context. The context for this project is the Europe-wide call for youth work to better establish its outcomes and impact (EC, Strategy for Youth, 2009; EC, 2014, Working with Young People; EC, 2015, Quality Youth Work). The outcomes of the project ( national partner country reports, E-book and briefing papers will be used to address this directly.The aims of this project are:1.To establish a European network to identify, develop and communicate the impact of youth work across 5 European countries. The objectives of the project are:2.  To embed the innovative, highly effective,  robust and sustainable method of evaluating youth work - Transformative Evaluation (TE) - developed in one national context (UK) in youth work organizations across 5 European partner countries.  3.  Demonstrate new knowledge  and evidence across Europe of the impact of youth work to inform local regional, national and European Policy.These aims will be met by the following objectives:(i) Training youth workers in the Transformative Evaluation (TE) method and then implementing 3 cycles of the process in 3 youth work organizations, in each of the 5 partner countries, over a one year period.(ii) Youth workers from these organizations supported by the coordinators will train other youth workers across their organization, and in other youth work organizations and settings, thereby developing a new 'community of practice'.(iii) Create a sustainable on-line training resource in TE to enable youth workers across Europe settings to be better able to evaluate their practice, and identify the impact of their work.(iv) identifying, comparing and contrasting the impact of youth work on young people and upon their wider communities across the 15 youth work settings in 5 European contexts.(v) Identifying what works, the processes which brought about these outcomes and how they were achieved. (vi) Communicate and disseminate this new knowledge via reports, policy briefings and an open access e-book(vii) Produce recommendations for policy makers / funders.(viii) Disseminate outputs through an International Conference.The project will have 5 phases1) Training in TE2) Embedding TE in youth work organizations3) Identification of the Impact of Youth Work 4) Establishment of  a new 'Community of Practice' & Production of a web based multi lingual resource 5) Dissemination through Reports, E-book and international conference The project is lead by Dr Jon Ord (University of St Mark & St John) Associate Professor in  youth work and there are 4 other universities, of HUMAK, Toulouse, Bari, Tallin coordinating the work in their native countries. There also 15 partner youth work organizations, 3 from each of the 5 countries.  Many of these are from deprived regions such as Cornwall, in the UK and Puglia in  Italy. The project will be expanded as youth workers share and train other youth workers through peer to peer training to significantly extend the reach of the project, creating a 'Community of Practice'.The results will be:- A significant demonstration of the impact of youth work across Europe. - The establishment of a 'community of Practice of youth workers trained in to demonstrate the impact of their work (TE)- The project has a sustainable paradigm as it is designed to grow and develop after it has been completed through the production of the Multi lingual Web based resource, the E-book and the community of practice that has been developed.
