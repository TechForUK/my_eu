This prototype will facilitate high-speed stacking, packing and safe transportation of a whole range of food products, with significant carbon footprint reduction, environmental impact and cost savings in materials. The new prototype food tray will utilise 25% less material and will be made from 100% recyclable rPET.

The EU-funded project http://www.rpet-fc.eu/ ('Environmentally-friendly food-packaging tray with lower carbon footprint') (RPET-FC) brought together five SMEs and three research organisations to address these issues.\n\nScientists developed a tray made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) improved in many ways compared to that of the market leader. Investigators developed three different formulations. One is 100\u00a0% post-consumer (PC) rPET. One is 85\u00a0% PC rPET co-extruded with other materials for improved sealing properties. The third is 85\u00a0% PC rPET co-extruded with other components for enhanced gas barrier properties (e.g. up to 70\u00a0% lower oxygen gas transmission and 50\u00a0% lower water vapour transmission). Further, researchers took the opportunity to assess deposition of a natural antibiotic/antioxidant (Citrox) on the packaging. Trials demonstrated successful antimicrobial activity against a wide range of both Gram (-) and Gram (+) bacteria, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter.\n\nThrough the development of novel rPET thermoforming tools and rPET formulations, researchers achieved 75\u00a0% faster thermoforming speeds and an improvement in cutting accuracy by 90\u00a0%. The trays are also 30\u00a0% lighter due to better material distribution. In addition, the design facilitated high-speed stacking, packing and safe transportation of a variety of foods. Taken together, scientists delivered a superior product with significantly lower material usage, waste and energy consumption for a reduction in carbon footprint in excess of 80\u00a0%.\n\nConsiderable interest has already been generated among many leaders in the food industry.

In its framework memorandum internationalization (appendix 1) funding programmes are described on the basis of which Graafschap College has been able to carry out several successful international projects. The projects of Graafschap College carried out within the programmes Leonardo da Vinci and VETpro have been assessed as  'Very Good' by the Dutch national agency of the Lifelong Learning Programme.  \r\n\r\nMerely because of the geographical location of our Achterhoek region in relation to Germany, internationalisation is a key focus area in the strategic policy of Graafschap College. Over the past few years Graafschap College has frequently gained experience with international work placements and student and teacher exchange projects. In its strategic policy \u201cSolid education for a solid region\u201d, the concept of labour globalisation has been adopted as an important development which Graafschap College wants to join. In 2014 and 2015 our institution wants to realize even more ambitions than in the recent past.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\n\r\nIn the next few years internationalisation is going to play an increasingly prominent role for Graafschap College. It is inescapable that the opening of the borders in Europe will also have major consequences for the Achterhoek region and that our school will take an even more active role in this matter. Starting point of the policy is that all activities and projects should match the goals of Graafschap College as described in the strategic policy 2010-2015. \r\n\r\n- leading player in the region\r\n\r\n- stimulating Lifelong Learning\r\n\r\n- innovation as a result of creativity\r\n\r\n- success from talent\r\n\r\n- strong professionals in a professional organisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncreasing international awareness and compentences among students and staff corresponds with all strategic goals. Cross-border experiences and encounters are accellerators of creativity, talents and learning power. In this way Graafschap College, as part of her core tasks,  gives an innovative impuls to the labour market. This impuls is even more desirable because, relatively speaking, both the economy and the working population in the Achterhoek region are more introverted than those in other regions. It stands to reason that the favourable geographical location in relation to Germany will be more and more benefited from, in particular the Euregion, i.e. the federal states of Nordrhein-Westfalen and Munsterland. Apart from this Graafschap College remains active in the field of exchange programmes and work placements in countries outside the Euregion.\r\n\r\nDerived from its strategic mission Graafschap College wants to be a school offering full scope international development opportunities for students and staff. International experiences are an integral and prominent part of the institutional portfolio. \r\n\r\nThe students are from the departments of Technics and Infromation Technology, Health and Welfare and Economics and Financial Services. In all cases it concerns students of levels 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nThe international work placements for students take place in Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Greece, Norway, France, Finland and Portugal during the period from July 2014 till May 2016. The placements cover periods ranging from 3 until 20 weeks. \r\n\r\nFor a description of waht a student has do do before, during and aftera n international work placement and what requirements apply, we refer to appendix 3, pages 15 and 16. From students\u2019 presentations and reports it appears time and again that they have increased their language skills and developed an open mind for habits in a different culture. Their independence has grown enormously and they have learned to deal with clients and customers with a different social and cultural background. \r\n\r\nThe international work placement for staff members takes place in Finland, Malta and Belgium. The staff members are from the same departments as the students. These work placements last one week. The staff members who go on such an international work placement are obliged to discuss their personal and professional learning aims with their manager. Ultimately the manager will decide if the staaf member in question is eligible for the international work placement.  \r\n\r\nThe staff member defines his/ her own personal learning aims.

A key point in the internationalization is an unfolding of practice learning by the implementation of the learning partner concept. A learning partner can be a student in class or at school, a teacher or a farmer nearby. It is crucial that the learning partners function is to contribute to pupils' learning and job training. The use of new technologies (Mooc\u2019s, and online learning) and international internships means that learning partners can also be a student or teacher at a secondary school in Bulgaria or an agricultural college student in England, or a farmer nearby one of these educational institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Learning Partner concept allows us to work with the individualization of learning, at the same time as the context is broadened due to the linguistic and cultural challenges that internationalization brings along. Mobility helps to make learning both practice- and adventure-oriented. The use of new learning technologies will help to increase the learning effect, increase motivation and the innovative element in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea is  that the use of active learning partner will contribute to the development of an active learning network where teachers, as active users of the learning partner concept, develop learning for common use both in language courses, academic courses and professional courses. That is why the network consist of partners from many European countries and from different sectors: NGOs , primary production, secondary schools , vocational schools , agricultural schools , colleges and universities . In addition to this KA1 application we have agreed to participate in several KA2 applications . The project can also be extended with several Danish partner institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school expects to send 120 students  at mobility over the next two years. All students are enrolled in basic animal -plant nature. The students are from approx. 16 years and older and have all completed K9. A large proportion of students want to study agriculture. A minority of pupils are not finally settled in their \r\n\r\nThe international class is a course of 25 to 40 weeks where the 4 weeks of mobility are included at the end of the process. From the start the program is carried out as blended and online courses involving learning partners from the European network. There are scheduled 6 overall social / learning process (Described in the Action Plan for Learning )\r\n\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/dalumerasmus/danish\r\n\r\nThe specific learning is undertaken on the basis of the current basic description within the course curriculum within Elevplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the teaching of basic courses are practice-oriented . This project seeks practical learning strengthened and expanded to include general topics and subjects through expanded use of learning partner in the international network . The school offers a single LMS to implement online and blended learning before, during and after mobility stay. The platform is also used to teachers, students and companies to develop online learning programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project contributes to the development of students' cultural competence and student learning abilities.\r\n\r\nThrough participation in the international project students self-understanding and belief in their own abilities will be increased.

Cross-border experiences and encounters increase creativity, talents and learning power.\r\nIn this way Graafschap College, acting  from its core tasks, gives an innovative impulse to the labour market. This impulse is the more desirable considering the introvert character of the working population of the Achterhoek compared to that of other regions of our country. It is obvious that the favourable location in relation to Germany will be much more used, especially the so-called \u2018Euregio.\u2019 Apart from this Graafschap College remains active in offering work-placements and exchange programmes with countries outside the Euregio.\r\nAs a result of the economic crisis the labour market perspective in the region has deteriorated fora n important number of jobs. This has led to a substantial growth of (youth) unemployment. A growing orientation and education with an international focus reduces the mbo-student\u2019s vulnerability.\r\nFor this call the implications are that the focus is much more directed towards Germany, as compared to previous calls. For 33 staff members a subsidy will be applied for to increase their German language skills in order to start a co-operation with a \u2018Berufskolleg\u2019 in Berlin. This is expected to have an innovative effect and appeal to students and that education programmes can be adapted to each other. For 25 students Germany is already scheduled in their diary.\r\nIn this call 39 staff members and 154 students have been included.

Besides, an external orientation contributes to general competences and a more active and creative professional attitude among graduates, which adds to the attractiveness of a candidate for a potential employer. Finally the candidate will be inclined to focus on other regions more readily.\r\nStaff members are expected to implement the newly acquired views, methods and knowledge.\r\nNumber and profile of the students\r\nThe students are mainly level 3 and 4 students of the departments Healthcare and Welfare, Economics and Finanacial Services and Technics and Information Technology. A new group of partcipating students is formed by students from \u2018My School\u2019, a very special group of students within Graafschap College.\r\nThe work-placements vary from 2 to 20 weeks\r\nImplementation of the project \r\nThe project will be carried out in co-operation with long-standing foreign partners and with intermediaries. Graafschap College serves as co-financing agent for students who make use of one of four intermediary agencies which have been acknowledged by the school. For every one of these students Graafschap College contributes an amount of \u20ac200.-\r\nIntended results and impact\r\n1 Improvement of the students\u2019 labour market perspective. From presentations and reports by the students it always becomes clear that language skills have improved, that they confront other customs and cultures with an open mind and that their independence has increased.\r\nStudents and staff  bring back extra professional baggage as a result of their international experiences and in this way they contribute to the development of the region the moment they start working for a company in their own region. This is the case, for example,  when they bring in a valuable network resulting from their international experiences. But, of course, outside the region internationally qualified employees are also wanted. \r\n2 By exchange programmes with other schools and companies/ institutions abroad Graafschap College can acquire new ideas and gain new knowledge which can be implemented in its own education. Of course the reverse is possible, too. This exchange of knowledge can be directed at both education methods and at professional topics.\r\n3 Ambassadors role for students and staff with international experience\r\nBest practices are shared at all levels within the school. Example: curriculum: pilot internationalisation, but direct lines within Graafschap College ensure that internationalisation is on the agenda, both as part of the policy and in realization.

Provide the participants a European professional experience that will help them  improve their professional skills and enhance their opportunities in the work market.\r\nWe want the project to be a reflection of our school. A project of inclusion where we will prioritize and promote equality and standardization. We have a high number of students at risk of exclusion, with fewer opportunities than others to train and, therefore, enter the labour market on equal terms.\r\nIn addition looking for a better specific technical training, we want to improve the cross-cutting aspects, such as the digital competences (online training), learning other languages, social competences.\r\nParticipants will be divided into three groups:\r\n\u2022 14 young people between 16 and 21 years old, mentally handicapped enrolled in a program that combines basic training with specific training carried out in workshops of different specialties: automotive, electricity, trade retail and horticulture. With this training students of this section prepare for employment not only in protected enterprises, but also in ordinary companies.\r\n\u2022 20 young people between 15 and 19 years old who have not reached the minimum goals in ESO (compulsory secondary education) in their centres of origin and attend the Centro San Viator. These students come to us with serious self-esteem issues and dragging problems (social, cognitive...) that have prevented them from getting their degree.\r\n\u2022 12 VET students of electro-mechanics and bodywork.\r\nDesigned activities are as follows:\r\nPreparing mobility: information for students, teachers, partners; selection of the participants; signing of the MoU and other necessary documentation with partners, preparation of participants\r\nMobility:  socio-linguistic adaptation, training courses, in-company  training.\r\nAssessment and reports: validation of the acquired competences; europass; prepare the annual report of activities; conducting interviews and surveys of satisfaction; implementation of corrective measures; diffusion and dissemination.\r\nFollowing the directions on recognition and transparency of EU tools, we will credit all what was learnt using the methodology developed through our project Your ECVET (Memorandum of Understanding, Learning Agreement, Assesment Sheets) and Europass.\r\nThe impact on students will be measured through aspects such as: overcoming the compulsory module FCT, obtaining the accrediting certificate of the corresponding speciality, achievement of the corresponding degree and the acquisition of key competences that will enhance their training and increase their chances of employability.\r\nThrough the participation of students in the Erasmus+program will increase the visibility of the school through the appearance in press and media. The impact on the Organization of this project will mean a step forward in the evolution of the Centre towards a European model of vocational training.\r\nIn the long term, with each mobility more and more students and teachers are interested in receiving training abroad, which means an increase in the educational quality of Centro San Viator. The socialization of the acquired knowledge will consolidate an innovative teaching-learning process  and geared towards the continuous improvement of teachers, students and the educational community.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-014402_3"], ["4PZ", "goMOVET - Mobility Across Europe V", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 71724.0, "The Municipal Vocational School for Manufacturing Technology Munich (BSFT) is implementing the project \"goMOVET - Mobility Across Europe V\" with the main activities `trainees / learners go to school institutions in Ausland' and` educational staff: learning stays by the Ausland'. As one of the key partners in the innovation transfer projects MOVET I and II BSFT looks back on a broad range of experience in the implementation of ECVET mobility. This background has led to the formation of a strategic partnership in KA2 project EMEU, in witch units of learning outcomes / modules are developed and carried out with a large number of partners.

Participants for the mobility of students are recruited from students of the dual training in the metal sector and electrical engineering (industrial mechanics, mechatronics, machinist, manufacturing mechanics and precision mechanics). At the learning stays of Education personnel abroad participate teachers in the metal and electrical engineering of BSFT and training staff from the dual training establishments in Munich.For the mobility of learners foreign vocational schools offer three-week units of learning outcomes / modules, which are developed according to the principles of ECVET. The intended learning outcomes (LE) range of the content of the compulsory curriculum for the respective German courses. Participants attend the end of the stay in the host institution an assessment attesting to the LE. The LE are validated and recognized in the home institution. To participate in this activity the trainees apply  and be selected by the training establishments in consultation with the BSFT.The learning stays of educational staff differ in two types of mobility.On the one hand  the BSFT sends teachers with  learners for a short time to the receiving vocational schools. Here are the expansion of knowledge of the VET systems and didactic concepts and the intensification of contacts with partner schools in the foreground.On the other hand the BSFT offers smaller groups of teachers the opportunity to expand their professional and cultural skills in one-week stays at the partner schools .

International contacts of Savo Consortium are essential for students, staff as well as for the companies of the whole Savo region. The key goals during the consortium's latest strategy period  include developing internationally valid skills for working life and adding possibilities for learning at work.   Coaching Professionals for the Future, PROFF, is a student and staff mobility project for all study fields of Savo consortium. Its goals lie in the consortium's operational plan for international issues. The PROFF goals are  1) to provide students and staff with high-quality mobility periods by improved pre-coaching and on-site guidance  2) to improve ways of assessing and validating both informal learning and life-long learning skills gained via mobilities 3) to enhance staff's internationally valid skills and knowledge of working life and develop on-site guidance methods  Except for increasing quality, PROFF aims to add volume of study and on-the-job learning periods of students and volume of staff's work periods.The quality of student mobilities is improved by new pre-coaching material and methods for living abroad and by building an equal consortium-wide system. PROFF coaching seeks to  provide students with essential basic knowledge of host country's culture and vital language skills to manage successfully their daily and working life situations as well as with field-specific skills.     PROFF offers mobility periods for 313 students which cover 2-10 weeks of studies or on-the-job learning in 16 countries. Students are in the basic vocational education of various fields at Savo vocational college. In general, mobility periods are taken part of in the final phase of the education. Each mobility period has its own contents and goals according to student's needs. For students with special needs PROFF offers shorter options of 2 weeks.  The students benefit from personal support of an attending teacher or a work tutor or optionally of practical nurse students during their mobility periods. PROFF's work placement periods range from 4 to 10 weeks and school-based study periods from 3 to 4 weeks. Consortium's partner schools offer international study modules that were created in various partner projects such as Automobility, EMEU, Transmobility, one2one. On-the job learning is included in these study modules.    PROFF is applying 49 staff mobilities for improving Savo consortium staff's international competences. The project develops pre-coaching of staff and methods for benefitting from new skills and competences gained abroad. PROFF targets to add knowledge and awareness concerning ECVET system including assessment and validation through all the study fields of the vocational college.   A staff mobility period comprises of a working period which adds to person's own professional or field-specific competences or of a shorter visit period at the on-the-job learning place of students for instruction or evaluation (job-shadowing). During these periods participants concentrate on assessing life-long learning skills  and the periods range from 3 -5 days' job shadowing periods to 1 or 2 weeks' working periods.   PROFF enables vocational students to gain professional, cultural and communicative skills giving strong sense of independence, self-reliance and braveness. Mobility periods upgrade and update students' skills and competences when starting a career or seeking a further educational path. PROFF fortifies staff readiness for international challenges, inspires to develop their professional field and increases international contacts and collegial co-operation. Best practices to provide education, evaluate students, to assess and validate learning outcomes can be profited by more and more organizations in the future.

This makes the cooperation and communication easier. LearnMob2 offers mobilities for youth and adult learners awithin basic, further vocational and specialist vocational qualification (64 mobilities) in the academic years 2016-2017 & 2017-2018 .Axxell strives for equality in international mobilities by also including students with fewer opportunities as well as students within further vocational and specialist vocational qualification in the mobilities. In order to increase the equality of learner mobilities, each unit/sector will be encouraged to send participants on mobilities. When selecting the participants focus is on who has the most to gain by taking part in a LearnMob2 mobility. Of the 64 mobilities reserved for students, 29 will be reserved for students who have fewer opportunities to participate in international mobilities.Already at the application stage, the objectives, expected results, dissemination etc. have been discussed by Axxell and the hosting partners.

The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.We want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. Students have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  The new project will allow us to provide a more rigorous level of detail to our training before the mobility. Students will receive personal and group assistance for their mobility periods and they get detailed instructions to complete a Europass CV and final report among other things. Training course will also be developed to college's learning platform. Additionally students will participate in a shared, common training before the mobility period. The training program includes information about the destination country, its culture, objectivities for the period, insurances and other practical matters. At the same time, we ensure that students complete an OLS-language test both before and after the period. Teachers and students, who have been earlier on a mobility period are asked to share their experiences at a training session.With the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. Staff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.The objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy. This project increases the reciprocal co-operation and develops both the sending and the receiving VET institution. After the mobility periods, participants will write a report which will be used with the future international co-operation and dissemination both inside and outside of the organization.

Employees who will continue to learn throughout and who can work in an international environment. In relation to this, Euregio plays an increasingly important role.In its new strategic plan 2015 \u2013 2020, Graafschap College has listed five strategic policies, one of them being:education in the Euregio network  and in an international global context.Graafschap College aims to offer both students and employees a learning environment where they acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to work as a professional in the dynamic, complex, increasingly international and culturally diverse society.These competences can be achieved by physical mobility. In order to (further) develop our students\u2019 international and intercultural competences, Graafschap College also offers internationalisation at home. Graafschap College students are prepared for a dynamic labour market focused on an international environment. Think of the border region with Germany for example.Main topics from September 2015 (start of the charter)In the fall of 2015, a study trip to Finland was organized together will colleagues from ROC Twente, for members of both Boards, directors and educational managers. Its central theme was VET in an international context. At this moment, the insights acquired are used to write the new framework document on internationalization, and a hands on approach in all sectors.Plusprogram for talented Engineering students:Four Engineering students will leave to Gambia in half a year\u2019s time, to work on a development project in close cooperation with Stichting Bouwen Nederland.Graafschap College by now participates in RADIX. This is a reference group of a number of internationalization coordinators of different regional schools. Graafschap College is secretary for the new Intereg V application, for the Gronau-Enschede euregion.At this moment Graafschap College looks into the possibility to become co-organiser of the so-called Europe Summer School.

We are applying for a fund to allow 23 employees to increase their knowledge of the German language and to cooperate with a Berufskollege in Berlin. The cooperation started in 2015, is extended and enhanced at the least.By mutual successful visits to each other\u2019s school, a project is now started to have students orientate on their profession, language skills (German and English) in order to prepare students even better for the professional and labour market. These students explicitly chose for optional program 1 International. Students take classes half of the day, or cooperate in a project (English and German) and join German students to their internship workplaces in Berlin. By now both optional programs have already been translated internationally for the Berlin Berufsschule, so that students can be received well prepared. It is expected the project will have a renewing and promotional influence on students, and that programs can be tuned into each other.Almost all students are offered German classes by now!Just like last year, there is an application for MIJN SCHOOL studentsBeside gaining practical skills, it is mostly about giving students the opportunity to become acquainted with another culture, society, and educational system. Many of the students enrolled in this project have been offered the opportunity to meet people outside their relatively limited social life. The vocational aspect of the exchange will be substantial. A guide is included in the application for this group. We apply for a fund for 63 students for a foreign internship in Germany.

International mobility of teachers also will be provided within a scope of internships with the purpose of professional and intercultural developing.In accordance with the application to get the Charter in 2016, 20 students and 3 teachers were planned to delegate to exchange program. According to this application, 22 students\u2018 and 7 teachers\u2018 visits are expected. The application includes two long-standing partners and new institutions in Latvia and Malta, in order to maintain efficient and innovative relations. According to the Strategy, a strong international network of partners will be developed.The planned visits of students cover 5 countries, 6 vocational training institutions, 5 areas of education, 8 specialties:\u2022 an auto mechanic;\u2022 an auto electrician;\u2022 a plumber;\u2022 a joiner;\u2022 a furniture maker;\u2022 a trimming builder;\u2022 a thermal insulation builder; \u2022 a computer hardware engineer.It is planned 10% increase in students' interships.

The project involves a variety of specialties which approve the values of the Strategy of Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) such as equal opportunities and tolerance even though the managment of so mobilities is much more complicated than to organize a larger groups mobilities into fewer institutions. Moreover, it planned to provide students from low-income families with opportunity to participate in internships as a half of the learners of Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) are from such families. According to the Strategy every student has the opportunity of comprehensive development.The duration of students\u2018 mobilities is 3 weeks. During one week students would visit educational institutions of practical training workshops (all host organizations in practical training workshops are equipped with modern teaching tools and practice equipment).  During the next two weeks students will proceed with their internships in companies. All students mobilities are related to the content of learning programme, therefore, in accordance with the Strategy, in order to ensure the transfer of skills and competences,  it is planned to assess students\u2018 outcomes and achievements using ECVET. It will not be difficult to manage during the mobilities of auto mechnics and auto electricians as we have experience in this field and basis for implementation of ECVET. It is also expected that there will not be difficulties in assessing learning outcomes of computer hardware engineers as we have signed the Memorandum with our education consortium. Moreover, Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) has a lot of experience in the implementation of ECVET.It is necessary to put more efforts within other mobilities for both the sending and the host organizations. On the other hand, the strong relations will be developed as the basis for long-term cooperation.Teachers\u2018 visits cover three countries. The visits to Latvian vocational training institutions will be held for. The participants will gain knowledge and practical skills both in host schools and in the companies of social partners. As a result, the teachers of wood processing and construction specialties will prepare a new module named \u201eRestoration of wooden products\u201c.  The teachers of trimming builders\u2018 and thermal insulation builders\u2018 specialties will prepare \u201eThe technological processes cards of mechanized plastering and painting\u201c.

According the Startegy, the mission of Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) is to provide students with innovative vocational training, seeking the compatibility of curriculum content and methodologies with educational programmes of foreign countries.Furthermore, the mobilities for vocational teachers who wish to gain experience working with students who have problems with social integration, also are planned. It is important to pay particular attention to the teachers\u2018 development of skills who work with students from low-income families.The long-term goal of  Kaunas Builders Training Center (Kaunas SRC) is to increase a well-known reputation in foreign countries.The mobilities of the teachers and students, cooperation in vocational education, intercultural integration, cultural awareness, update of curriculum content include all international of vocational training activities listed in the Strategy.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-LT01-KA116-022996_4"], ["4PZ", "Broaden your World", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 98894.0, "The importance of competences obtained from the international mobility period is increasing in the current employment markets. The mobility periods have several positive effects: enhancement of students\u2019 autonomous and entrepreneurial attitude, wider perspective for work, extended networks and improved language skills. International experiences enhance students\u2019 self-confidence, improve their problem solving skills and help them to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and thus, they will be better prepared to work in multicultural environments. These skills ensure also better employability. This project makes a significant contribution for the vision of our VET institution which addresses the focus point of training competent professionals for the Helsinki metropolitan region, in Business Administration as well as in Information and Communication Technologies.\r\n\r\nWe want to ensure the international experiences also for those students who need encouragement and support on their studies. The international mobility period can be a remarkable experience which opens new opportunities for the students. Apart from the BA students, we want to pay special attention for the students in ICT in order to improve both their study motivation and courage. The purpose is to enhance their employability and to encourage to continue further their studies. \r\n\r\nStudents have both short and long on-the-job-learning periods and few of them have prolonged on-the-job-learning program which means the length of the mobility periods varies, but is at least 8 weeks long. Student exchange periods are 6 weeks long which is suitable for the German VET institutions using the dual system.  The exact time will be negotiated with the intermediary organizations beforehand. The partner VET institutions offer support for the student if needed. An on-the-job-learning instructor keeps contact with the work place and with the student and a Finnish teacher undertakes a guidance and monitoring visit to the on-the-job-learning placement during the mobility. At the same time, the teacher can search for new on-the-job-learning placements.  \r\n\r\nIn this project we broaden our partner network so that we can provide even more opportunities for our students and personnel to get acquainted with different cultures, working cultures and education systems. We have new partner schools or organizations in Italy, Poland, Malta and Sweden.  We will be offering the possibility of participating in international mobility for a larger target group as well, as we include also students and staff of Adult learning and recently graduated students.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of our international partners, we wish to learn new practices and teaching models. The project-based model is common in the current working life and therefore our objective is to develop the project-based learning model at teaching. \r\n\r\nStaff of our VET institution can participate in one week long job shadowing period at a partner VET institution. Teachers have also a possibility to participate in two weeks of teacher exchange. In this case, they will teach lessons in English at the partner VET institution according to their own competences at the same time as a partner teacher is respectively substituting their lessons in Finland. During the exchange period, teachers will follow, participate and discuss about the development of teaching, guidance, working life co-operation and teaching administration. The purpose of the teacher exchanges is to gain new ideas for teaching and development of other activities with mutual comparative analysis. If possible, teachers can combine the job shadowing period to the on-the-job-learning monitoring visits if there are students at the same destination. Students will benefit indirectly from the teachers\u2019 job shadowing periods and teacher exchanges because new teaching methods motivate and inspire students. In addition, teachers will gain a more positive attitude towards international affairs.\r\n\r\nThe objective of our VET institution is to increase the international activities according to our strategy. This project increases the reciprocal co-operation and develops both the sending and the receiving VET institution. After the mobility periods, participants will write a report which will be used with the future international co-operation and dissemination both inside and outside of the organization.

This platform is important because the participants have to translate the ideas to the teams and students. The participants in this platform support the students in all the steps that are needed to go abroad, information, preparation, practical issues, tutoring, validation and dissemination. Also they inform and help the colleagues.\r\nThere is also a strategic platform, herein participate the director of the sector of Bussiness, the coordinator of the international Office and a member of the Board.\r\n\r\nWe use our website and ELO for information and training purposes. We have developed a number of documents and there is a list to control (annex 7). Students are doing a number of tasks before going. Their tutor in the college is deciding which tasks have to be done. Every participant has to write a final report which can be published on the website. Also they have to give a presentation.\r\n\r\nWe work closely with our partners abroad.

Many of the modules are offered through a college Network www.EM-EU.EU which is developed through a KA2 Strategic partnership (participating partners: JAO, Finland; Horizon College, Netherlands; XABEC and Bizkaia, Spain; Bridgwater & Taunton, UK). In the EMEU network, we focus on implementation of ECVET and quality assurance of modules. Cooperation with Lycee Professionel Monge (F), Da Vinci College (NL) and West College Scotland (UK) is following the same concept and guidelines although the colleges are not yet a part of the EMEU network. \r\n170 students and 25 teachers are to benefit from this mobility project, which follows the development plan of the international strategy of AARHUS TECH. \r\n\r\nPreviously the main international activities for students were integrated in a prolonged the basic course. With the new reform, we had to rethink this. The spring of 2016 a test of an optional course \u2018Go Global\u2019, which includes an ECVET accredited mobility experience UK, was tested. The optional course are for basic Year students who has the needed levels of Math, English, Physics and Danish and thereby have the possibility to choose extra curricula courses. Go Global was tested with ICT and Auto Mechanic students. Go Global a course for the students on cultural intelligence. This part of the course is now being further developed and embedded across the college. Another learning from the test course was that a 3 week mobility was too long for a large group of students to be able to pass the basic course. 3 out of 19 students did not pass the exam. We have decided to continue to run the optional course but reduce the mobility to two weeks.\r\n\r\nA total of 25 teachers and supporting staff is expected to benefit from this mobility project. The job shadowing will focus on: quality assurance and administration of international mobility, internationalisation at home, embedment of ECVET and of course specialised educational areas as advanced testing of materials (Lycee Monge), decorative painting (Bizkaia) and racing (Bridgwater&Taunton). Furthermore 3 teachers will have teaching assignments with partners on areas where we have expertise (accuracy in CNC), specialised welding.\r\n\r\nOur Charter application got a very positive feed back. There are 3 points we would like to reflect.\r\nImplementation of ECVET is improving rapidly. Being part of the strategic partnership EMEU has fuelled the process. The use of ECVET for international mobility is now a standard in the majority of educations involved in international cooperation and an increasing number of teachers are competent and can assist their peers in developing and describing ECVET modules. The transfer is both within each department and across department \u2013 for instance between ICT and painters who are now also included in the EMEU Network. \r\n\r\nThe Value of having both in-coming and out-going students is being strengthened. Using the Module concept across educations makes it realistic that all students at some point in their education will attend a module either abroad or together with international students at AARHUS TECH being taught in English.\r\n\r\nDissemination of project results needs continuous attention. This is definite an aspect which can still be improved. Therefore, the communication department is also involved in this project as active participants. It is the aim that the international strategy in the future also will include a dissemination strategy involving the communication department.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DK01-KA116-034032_7"], ["4PZ", "Mobility Makes Us Professional IV", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 241665.0, "According to current mobility project, 107 students and 46 employees from P\u00e4rnumaa Kutsehariduskeskus will participate in mobilities abroad.

As an example of that we could point that this year we have decided to include a group of students with a new profile. Since 2016 we haven teaching \"professionalism certificates\" to students with intellectual disability who already are working in protected companies and they need to get their training accredited. We believe that doing their workplacement abroad will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy, both at a professional and personal level. Likewise, we have considered this is the right moment to add to this internationalization process a new dimension. We have included our teachers in our mobilities so that all this process does not finish with our students. To accomplish this task we will count with our european partners, who offer our students, and now, also our teachers, the chance to extend their academic training in other countries. \r\nWe want to offer to the participantes an European work experience that enables them to improve their professional competences and increases the opportunities to get a job. We have chosen different types of mobilities in each case:\r\n1.- VET students who will have their workplacement in companies abroad. The students will be divided according two different profiles:\r\n a.- Young people between 16 and 21 years old, mentally handicapped enrolled in a program that combines basic training with specific training carried out in workshops of different specialities.\r\nb.- Young people between 15 and 19 years old who have not reached the minimum goals in ESO (compulsory secondary education) in their centres of origin and attend the Centro San Viator. These students come to us with serious self-esteem issues and dragging problems (social, cognitive...) that have prevented them from getting their degree.\r\n2.-  VET students who will have a study period abroad, theoretical + practical. They are students who are studying VET Middle Degree(EQF3). Most of these students come from a VET education and therefore have already suffered school failure and have or have had risk of social exclusion. \r\nCHANGES regarding the participants' profiles:\r\n3. Students with intellectual disability who are already working in protected companies and are studying/have studied at our school to get the professional certificate  (in different areas) completelly accredited.  They will do part of their workplacement abroad and we are sure that it will help them to improve their self-esteem and autonomy.\r\n 4. One of our teachers (Ane Ruiloba) will spend a month in a Norwegian school that works with the Montessori methodology. She will improve her academic training spending a month there doing an observation/job shadowing period. The election of this teacher for the mobility has been made taking into account that she already has a officialy accredited B2 level in norwegian and this will allow her to interact with the students and take part in the academic school life with the rest of the staff, as well as having the same training the rest has, and therefore, make the most of the mobility.\r\n5. VET teachers who will get the chance during a week  to know, via job shadowing, the best educational methodologies in schools that have years developing them.\r\nThe long path this project has done, starting in 2007, has allowed us to know that the participants with special needs and the students  at risk of exclusion can not be alone during the mobilities; and we cannot forget that some of them will be minors. That's why we need that two teachers from the scholl travel with each group, so they can monitor and support the participants during the whole period. The number of carers has not been arbitrarily done, it has been analysed and carefully studied. Just a carer would not be enough,  if something happened with a participant and he/she had to  be accompanied ( to the hospital, doctor, etc.), the rest would be alone. But we also understand that more than two carers would be unreasonable. Experience also allows us to see that from an organisational point of view more people often cause a logistics problem, as for example, a minibus can only sit 9 people. We are aware that this project aims to allow the participants to acquire autonomy, but we cannot ignore that some of them need a planification and supervision of daily tasks as hygiene, feeding, means of transport...\r\nIn 2007 our project Aurrerantz started to ease the mobility of 8 intellectuallly handicapped students (and 2 carers) while they were doing their work placement.

VET teachers who will get the chance during a week  to know, via job shadowing, the best educational methodologies in schools that have years developing them.\r\nThe long path this project has done, starting in 2007, has allowed us to know that the participants with special needs and the students  at risk of exclusion can not be alone during the mobilities; and we cannot forget that some of them will be minors. That's why we need that two teachers from the scholl travel with each group, so they can monitor and support the participants during the whole period. The number of carers has not been arbitrarily done, it has been analysed and carefully studied. Just a carer would not be enough,  if something happened with a participant and he/she had to  be accompanied ( to the hospital, doctor, etc.), the rest would be alone. But we also understand that more than two carers would be unreasonable. Experience also allows us to see that from an organisational point of view more people often cause a logistics problem, as for example, a minibus can only sit 9 people. We are aware that this project aims to allow the participants to acquire autonomy, but we cannot ignore that some of them need a planification and supervision of daily tasks as hygiene, feeding, means of transport...\r\n So in this new  call we apply for the mobiliby of 25 participants (with 4 carers) during two school years with different approaches:\r\n- Work placement\r\n- Training in VET schools + companies\r\n-Job shadowing for teachers.", "http://www.bridgwater.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA116-049473_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["4FJ", "Local Manufacturing Advisory Programme (LMAP)", "SWMAS Ltd", "The project will address  low productivity by targeting support at key priority sectors defined by the LEPs (primarily Advanced Manufacturing, Low Carbon and Food and Drink Manufacturing) where the greatest local benefit can be delivered.", "ERDF", 2476198.0, 4705261.0, "erdf_england_460"], ["4FJ", "Cornish High Value Manufacturing Investment Programme (HVMIP)", "SWMAS Ltd", "The project will work with existing manufacturers and start-ups to help them realise their growth potential.", "ERDF", 727900.0, 909874.0, "erdf_england_511"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["4PZ", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 818.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18459", 2016], ["4PZ", "BRIDGWATER AND TAUNTON COLLEGE", 46748.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European education and training area and its relevance to the labour market (15.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_34940", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA6"}
