The absence of internationally recognized open standards is a limiting factor in terms of industrial performance when com-panies have to select among these enablers.\nCESAR will bring significant and conclusive innovations in the two most improvable systems engineering disciplines:\n-  Requirements engineering in particular through formalization of multi viewpoint and multi criteria requirements,\n- Component based engineering applied to design space exploration comprising multi-view/multi-criteria architecture trade-offs.\nIn addition CESAR intends to provide industrial companies with a breakthrough in system development by deploying a customizable systems engineering \u2018Reference Technology Plat-form\u2019 (RTP) making it possible to integrate or interoperate existing or emerging available technologies. This will be a significant step forward in terms of industrial performance im-provement that will help to establish de-facto standards and contribute to the standardization effort from a European perspective.\nRelying on industrial use-cases and scenarios, CESAR is strongly industry driven. It will ad-dress societal safety, mobility and environmental demands from a multi-domain point of view, relying on high maturity inputs (TRL 4) and target high maturity outputs (TRL 6).\nQuantified objectives are defined  in the proposal regarding integration aspects (RTP), processes and product- related aspects.", 50602.0, 50472795.0, "CESAR", null, null, null, null, "http://www.auvation.com", null, "fp7_105450_953571014"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["4LZ", "RW1", "Fleet Community Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "GU51"}
