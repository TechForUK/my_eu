Newly qualified students will perform an internship in European companies of their sectors to improve their specific professional qualification, while acquire socio-cultural and linguistic skills in different destinations.        + Objective 2: To foster entrepreneurship and openness to new ideas and ways of working, not only from the point of view of the students but also the teachers of the schools of the consortium and of the management.
