Often teachers or traininers visit the receiving companies shortly before the end of the stay in order to do the assessemnt together with the local tutor.By all means, Berlin as a member of the city network XARXA FP applies the evaluation forms which were developed according to the development of the certification ISO 9001:2000 (or now 2008). In whole, the Senate Department for Education plans not only to send young persons during their initial vocational training, experts, trainers and teachers, and young professionals in their first year after finishing their vocational training into mobilities, but also to support the vocational schools and the training companies as far as administrative tasks for running an EU-project is concerned. At the same time, they should have all the liberty possible in order to design their strategy for internationalization.Through these mobilities, the cooperation is continually followed up and at the same time, the basis of mutual trust is being reinforced so that partnership projects lead to more MoUs which will make mobilities with an increased qualitiy.By and by the networks thus develop into a \"closely knit fabric\". This is an obvious sign for the fact that Europe is growing together in the field of vocational training and employment. It is worth mentioning that we have event come to a \"second generation of trainees\".

LBP is the fourth most common diagnosis seen in primary care (after upper respiratory infection, hypertension, and coughing).

This project aims to develop a decision support system - SELFBACK - that will be used by the patient him/herself to facilitate, improve and reinforce self-management of LBP. Specifically, SELFBACK will be designed to assist the patient in deciding and reinforcing the appropriate actions to manage own LBP after consulting a health care professional in primary care. The decision support will be conveyed to the patient via a smartphone app in the form of advice for self-management. The advice will be tailored to each patient based on the symptom state, symptom progression, the patients goal-setting, and a range of patient characteristics including information from a physical activity-detecting wristband worn by the patient.

Recent computers instead use two, four or even twelve processor cores working together ``in parallel', giving peak performance that is equivalent to a 5GHz, 10GHz or even 30GHz single processor, but at a fraction of the projected energy usage. There have even been experimental 48-core ``single cloud computer' chips giving peak performance that would exceed that of a 100GHz single processor. The effective exploitation of such high performance is essential to support modern demands for computing power in the home, in industry and in the economy at large. Combining this with low energy usage is crucial if the performance is to be delivered at a reasonable financial and environmental cost.<br/>Future designs will harness even greater numbers of processor cores, perhaps in the thousands or millions, and perhaps with widely varying speeds and capabilities. These will be combined with advanced graphics processor units and other specialist units to give further performance and energy gains.

Queries are becoming even more broad and complex essentially due to context of the search process (e.g. the system, user, language, the word and action meaning, socio-psychological dimensions, interface and interaction methods). Over the past three decades, the research in IAR had led to various search engine models, such as vector space and probabilistic models. Unfortunately there has been no comprehensive investigation at the theoretical level for effectively integrating elements of context to create advanced search technology. The key issue preventing such research is a lack of a unified theoretical framework to seamlessly integrate the dimensions of context into the search engine models and into the evaluation protocols. This proposal is hinged on the belief that the dimensions of context can be naturally integrated into a generic and fundamental framework.

Variations in salinity will incur offsets in oil and gas volume data from subsea multiphase flow meters (MPFMs), and may also indicate water breakthroughs, in which the wells starts to produce injected sea water. Both these effects bring about considerable losses for the operator. The number of subsea installations is steadily increasing and the problem is therefore felt in the industry. The only method today for checking salinity in individual well streams involves ROV intervention, a hugely expensive operation. The Idea is to develop a sample and analysis system for installation upstream from MPFMs on subsea manifolds. Integrated in the flow line, the system will sample the multiphase production from the well, allow the fluid to separate into its single phases by electrostatic coealescing and measure the salinity of the water fraction. By monitoring the salinity, the MPFM may be regularly calibrated and the offset is removed. Salinity measurements will also enable early detection of water breakthrough, where wells start to produce injected sea water instead of oil. The system will: - Improve accuracy of MPFMs by removing errors caused by variations in salinity - Enable early detection of water breakthrough through detection of said variation in salinity - Verify MPFM data by volume fraction estimation in sample separation tank SalinityScan will involve extensive development work in several research areas, including oil separation technology, ultrasound level gauging, control electronics, mechanical design and subsea instrumentation.
