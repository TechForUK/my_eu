The TACMON technology is innovative in that it applies electrostatic MEMS actuator technologies with a micro hydraulic amplitude transmission to realize a large matrix of tactile dots using cost-effective bath-processing technologies. There are 7.4 million visually impaired people in the European Union. High unemployment amongst the disabled is a serious social and economic problem for the EU, as continued exclusion from productive activity requires increasing state-funded support for social programs. There is a need for effective assistive technology to facilitate employment of the visually impaired and for industry to better be able to meet anti-discrimination legislation. Furthermore, the EU is investing heavily in e-learning to modernize education and training, but locking out the visually impaired since information and communication technologies are heavily oriented to visual user interfaces. The EU must quickly address the needs of sector SMEs that provide technological solutions for the disabled, as there is a continuous competitive threat from both foreign companies and large enterprises. TACMON offers SMEs an innovative technology targeting an interactive graphical tactile display and user interface for the visually impaired to access electronic information. TACMON technology can contribute to the creation of new business opportunities in software for learning, leisure, communicating via Internet, among many others for the disabled community. The TACMON product responds to important market demands in industry, education and other sectors that lack appropriate inclusive technology adaptable to meet the needs of their visually impaired clients.", 252541.0, 3369029.0, "TACMON", "An innovative touch screen for the blind", "There are 12 million blind people in the European Union.

Their exclusion from the workforce leads to social isolation, which ultimately results in higher social support costs for society. Assistive technologies can help overcome these barriers.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.tacmon.eu/new/ (TACMON) project developed an innovative and cost-effective touch screen technology that provides blind people with interactive access to both textual and graphically oriented electronic information. The system consists of three modules: a novel tactile actuator chip based on micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, the driver electronics for the MEMS, including high-voltage electronics, and a pneumatic support system.\n\nIn combination with conductive elastomer technologies, MEMS technology is critical for success. MEMS allows for a large matrix of tactile dots to be produced using low-cost electrochemical bath techniques. The pneumatic support system ensures the forces on the tactile dots are maintained.\n\nSoftware specifications for this module, which is a graphical application, were specified with the help of the HyperBraille project. TACMON's research was successfully completed with a small-scale functional prototype demonstrating the viability of both the actuator technology and the other technologies required.\n\nA start-up company holding the jointly-owned TACMON intellectual property rights has been established as a platform for the further development and market introduction of the project's technology.\n\nThe current technology already offers a significant cost advantage compared to the state of the art.

The proposed project aims to extend the applicability of composite moulds into the more demanding regime of RTM production, as well as to extend the application of the open mould and light RTM techniques in the field of advanced resin systems, where elevated temperature is required. Most important Innovations are: i. embedded heating elements, based on the carbon reinforcement of the mould, close to the mould-part interface demanding less energy. ii. Incorporation of flow, temperature and cure sensors that will enable full automatic control of the process. iii. Layout of a cooling system consisting of a conformal (following the contour of the part) tubing network. iv. Use of piezoceramic film actuators which will induce micro-vibrations and thus assist resin flow inside the cavity. Such actuators on the edges, can be used for demoulding thus reducing tool complexity and demoulding time. Integration of these functionalities into a single \u201csmart\u201d mould is anticipated to impart a significant advancement of the composite and plastics manufacturing industry. It is obvious that by lowering the cost of the moulds the application of high end composites into the sectors of aerospace and automotive industry widens, serving weight reduction and the greening of the transport sector while extending the use of composites in other industrial sectors such as leisure and sport, the energy sector etc. Managing to develop composite moulds for the demanding RTM field, would automatically make them available for other manufacturing processes for engineering plastics and composites (RIM, Transfer moulding, Resin Infusion).

The moulds have conventionally been made of metal. Composite moulds are gaining ground, but primarily in manufacturing processes with relatively mild conditions. In order to increase the temperature capabilities of the composite moulds so as to tap new markets, important advances in mould technology are required.\n\nA large European consortium launched the EU-funded http://www.coeus-titan.eu/ (COEUS-TITAN) (Innovative smart composite moulds for cost-effective manufacturing of plastic and composite components) project to develop needed technology.\n\nFor heating the mould and its contents, scientists embedded conductive carbon fibres close to the surface of the mould among a number of nano-doped layers having high thermal conductivity. This ensures maximum heat transfer to the resin to reduce energy consumption. The team also developed flow, temperature and cure sensors to enable fully automated process control in combination with analysis tools for process parameter optimisation.\n\nA novel cooling system consisted of a network of channels that followed the contour of the part. Heat transfer fluid circulated through the channels to absorb heat from the system. Two different piezoelectric actuators were evaluated for their ability to enhance resin flow based on electrically induced micro-vibrations. Finally, a new metallic coating based on nanofillers and mineral fillers improved chemical resistance to the resins and facilitated repair in case of damage.\n\nThe final tooling integrated all developed technologies and tested them in an experimental infusion protocol. Further optimisation is expected to lead to a breakthrough in smart composite mould design and extension of moulding capabilities.\n\nManufacturers will be able to use the cost-effective mould technology in the demanding environment of resin transfer moulding. This technique is increasingly used to produce smooth components with large surface areas and complex shapes such as those required by the aerospace sector.

To improve our educational offer by using active methodologies and attract students who now choose private schools in our town. 3. To open new horizons to Europe creating partnerships with other European schools with the aim of developing projects together and exchanging teachers.4. To offer our teachers opportunities for personal, social and professional improvement.The activities that have been planned are the following: - Three study visits (job shadowing) to schools in France,  United Kingdom and Italy.- One course about the Finnish educational system including visits to schools in Finland.The expected outcomes for our teachers are as follows:- Improvement of language skills (English or French) in their academic field. - Increasing knowledge about Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL)- Improving of teaching skills.  - Ability to adapt to a new culture, values and new ways of organization.- Skills to create a European network that in the short term allows our school to develop European educational projects.- Skills to encourage students to compare between our culture and other European countries' culture  We expect the following impact:\u2022 Students can take advantage of cultural resources created during the study visits.  These resources will increase students' motivation as they will be able to develop cultural projects based on research with a task-based approach. This fact will help students to develop their basic skills as European citizens. \u2022 Teachers could propose improvements in the methodology of our school. \u2022 We could be involved in future Erasmus+ projects.\u2022 Our multilingual approach will be improved and CLIL could be extended to more subjects and teachers.\u2022 The networks established can make our students contact with students from other countries, develop learning projects, visits or school associations through eTwinningThese are the expected benefits in the long term:\u2022 Our school can increase its reputation and attract more students.\u2022 We can be an attractive institution for teachers that cares about their training and professional development.  \u2022 We can also be a reference school for European projects in our region.", "http://www.highhousenursery.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-ES01-KA101-024265_1"], ["2RL", "Specific Training Aiming at Renewable energies and Sustainability", "The Mosaic Art And Sound Ltd.", 13392.0, "Sustainability is a major concern for today's societies and the European VET sector also has to face this challenge by preparing learners for the new objectives which are pointed out in the strategy \"Europe 2020\" and by being closer to the industrial world. This is the reason why 5 European institutions created a partnership whose main goal is to contribute to support young learners or adults in the reach of knowledge, competences and qualifications, in order to facilitate their integration in the professional fields of renewable energies or ecobuilding.To reach this goal, the Lyc\u00e9e Charles Augustin COULOMB initially elaborated a 3-step European Development Plan :- Phase n\u00b01 (preparatory step) : search of potential European partners ;- Phase n\u00b02 (Leonardo da Vinci partnership with 4 other VET institutions, \"European Training Modules-Renewable Energies\", reference 2012-1-FR1-LEO04-35536 1) : creation of a European training kit called \"STARS\" (\"Specific Training Aiming at Renewable energies and Sustainability\") including 5 different and complementary training modules which offer several possible solutions to the following question : \"How to get energetical self-sufficiency in a European village ?\" ;- Phase n\u00b03 (individual mobilities of learners) : launching of a sustainable project proposing European mobilities to the specific needs of the 5 institutions' learners who would like to get some advantage from the \"STARS\" programme.The forecasted mobilities are related to 12 French learners of the Lyc\u00e9e Charles Augustin COULOMB, selected in order to follow one foreign training module of the \"STARS\" programme. These learners are completing their STI2D Baccalaur\u00e9at national curriculum and they have got specific learning in European classes. The third step of the European Development Plan will reinforce their national training (which is already focused on technology and sustainability) adding a different concrete experiment and allowing them to live a unique moment mixing intercultural, linguistic and vocational dimensions and making their potential employability rise.Such a project will normally have a substantial impact both on the VET sector and on many actors taking part in environment, social studies or economy (public authorities or private entities).In order to make this mobility project more visible, a large dissemination plan has been thought. This plan will use different informatory tools (event days, leaflets and posters, multimedia documents, new ICT tools) and it will be focused on each impacted sector.The \"STARS\" programme was elaborated with a strong will to reach sustainable mobilities of learners througout Europe. These mobilities will participate in making social, cultural and vocational cultures be closer on our continent.

Another 20 apprentices will participate in long-term mobilities within the initiative ErasmusPro, with work placements of a length between 95 and 100 days. From summer 2018 onwards IFA will organise internships for small groups. Applicants will be selected on the basis of their technical, linguistic and personal skills. IFA will organise the travels, stays abroad, work placements, accommodation and insurance for the participants as well as accompanying language courses. IFA will also prepare the apprentices for the stays and ensure that the internships will be recognized as part of the apprenticeship training in Austria in accordance with the Vocational Training Act (BAG).\r\n\r\n121 students from vocational schools and colleges will also complete internships according to their professional fields designed especially for their level of knowledge. The internships will be organised in close cooperation with the sending schools in order to ensure they will be recognized as part of the obligatory internships. Most of the student internships will take place in the summer of 2018. The duration of these internships will range from 2 weeks to 3 months.\r\n\r\nThe content and objectives of the internships are defined according to the occupational and training profiles as well as the individual skills of the participants and is specified before the start of the internships in Learning Agreements between IFA, the participants and the sending and receiving institutions. The apprentice groups will be attended by an accompanying person from IFA during the first week abroad. This person will help the apprentices to get accustomed to the host country and will visit all the companies providing the work placements in order to ensure that they comply with the objectives. Contact persons at the receiving institution and IFA will be available to support the participants throughout their entire stay abroad.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, within the framework of the project, 80 training officers from companies and teachers from vocational schools as well as vocational training experts will participate in a week-long workshop to exchange their experiences. The expert visits are designed to learn about VET systems in other countries, compare them with the Austrian system and exchange ideas amongst each other and with colleagues abroad. The overall goal is to promote the quality, innovation and the European idea in vocational education and training through cross-border exchanges. The participants are multipliers and can share their experiences in companies, schools and throughout Austria and thus contribute to the quality assurance and to the Europeanisation of the Austrian VET system.\r\n\r\nWhile abroad, the participants will acquire technical, linguistic, social, intercultural and personal skills and broaden their personal and professional horizons. An internship abroad contributes to the strengthening of important key skills such as teamwork, independence, sense of responsibility and flexibility. Experiences abroad promote career opportunities and ensure the future career of the participants and thus the competitiveness of Austrian companies. International exchange programmes increase the overall quality of the Austrian VET. \r\n\r\nIFA has been organising internships abroad for apprentices, professionals and training officers since 1995. Since its foundation IFA has helped more than 8,000 individuals to take part in an EU-funded stay abroad. As the applicant and coordinating institution IFA will be responsible for ensuring the quality and proper implementation of the project. \r\n\r\nIFA cooperates with a network of experienced partners in the target countries. Partnership agreements (Memoranda of Understanding) defining the conditions and quality criteria with all these institutions have already been signed. With most of the partner institutions IFA has been collaborating successfully for many years. Throughout the entire stay abroad contact persons from the receiving institutions, the host companies and IFA are at the participants\u2019 disposal to supervise the progress and quality of their internships. Upon completing the internships, all participants will receive a \u2018Personal Transcript\u2019 outlining the activities completed as well as the knowledge and skills acquired and validated by the receiving institutions and host companies.
