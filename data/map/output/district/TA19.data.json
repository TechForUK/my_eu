An optimal operating temperature lower than originally planned will have major benefits, including reduced energy consumption, faster processing times and higher throughput.\n\nCarbon black and hot gas, the products of the pyrolysis process, are both high in sulphur content. The carbon black is activated with steam in a simple procedure to increase its commercial value. The hot vapour is cooled, compressed and injected under pressure into a hydrodesulphurisation unit (a fixed-bed reactor) to yield ultralow-sulphur oil, ultralow-sulphur gas and sulphur. A condensing system that produces condensed sulphur-rich oils instead of vapour significantly reduces the cost and complexity of the system.\n\nThe shell-and-tube-type heat exchanger of the condenser facilitates heat and steam recovery to satisfy the system's energy requirements and to activate the carbon black.

In this way, a set of analysis processes must be performed over the artwork, involving piece moving, manipulation, transportation, etc, and therefore putting the artwork at risk of deterioration.

Such images contain spectroscopic information of the piece to be analysed in different bands of the spectrum, giving chemical composition information of the different materials and layers in the actual 3D surface by means of a very narrow screening bandwidth and the use of volumetric digitisation.
