The Cospace Platform is a new way of programming robots in a virtual environment and use this very same code for real robots as well.\r\n\r\nThe discussions and results will be published. Teaching and learning materials will be provided in an interactive way, raised on a level of teenage and adult thinking and translated into all project languages. \r\n\r\nOur project results will be:\r\n* acquire skills in various technological and scientific areas. By programming virtual robots and virtual worlds the students will gain IT-skills within the \u201cCospace platform\u201d\r\n* to setup a project website  on eTwinning for internal and external communication. \r\n* work on a concept of encouraging students with low study skills\r\n* produce a multimedia and multilingual dictionary and partner presentations\r\n* produce ready to use, well prepared school lessons in the field of robotics - focussed on Cospace\r\n\r\nA main focus of the project will be students with low study skills, students coming from a difficult financial environment, students with low self-confidence, migration background and other social problems. Although this sometimes applies only to a little part of the class we try to integrate them with the others to establish a strong social bond in the class in order to lead them to a successful graduation. \r\n\r\nBecause of the intense communication and the visits all participants can learn the daily school schedule from other countries and learn from the partners. The language skills of the participants will get increased and improved. The use of modern ways of communication (eTwinning, Skype, etc.) is practiced. Because of the visiting activities to other European countries stereotypes about these countries will be decreased. \r\nThe students with low study skills, which will be integrated, profit from the group dynamic and will be motivated to do better performance. Because of that the chances of a possible early dropout will be strongly decreased and the chances of a successful career will be increased. \r\nThe schools gain experience in Robot technology and the European partnership. Therefore the European Image of the schools will be improved. Furthermore this makes the school more attractive for students, teachers and companies. \r\nAll project experiences of the students are a huge additional benefit for the companies in the school area. This special knowledge can be integrated in developing high standard products. \r\n\r\nThis project is an example for good international co-operation within ERASMUS+. \r\nERASMUS+ will get more famous in schools, communities and policy makers. It contributes indirectly to the integration of Europe and the understanding between the nations.", "http://www.countyupper.suffolk.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA219-004968_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "IP32"}
