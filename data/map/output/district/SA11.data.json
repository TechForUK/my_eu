However the use of ceramic SOFC cells inherently impose limits in terms of reliability, cost and ability to handle transients.  The objective of the METSOFC project is to develop the next generation of metal based SOFC stack technology. Within the project metal supported SOFC cells will be developed and tested and new metallic stack materials will be developed and tested as well, including new robust insulating seals between layers. Finally, the developed stacks will be tested up to the 1 kWe level.   The METSOFC project consists of six work packages:  WP1  Product and test definition WP2  Materials and components WP3  Cells WP4  Stacks WP5  Testing WP6  Dissemination and exploitation of project results   The METSOFC consortium comprises a strong vertically integrated team, representing all core competences necessary to carry out the development. Between them, the partners have the sufficient experience and position to ensure that the technology developed will be market oriented and industrially relevant. The members of the METSOFC consortium have also been selected to provide the LEANEST and most efficient organisation possible. All the members have prior collaboration experience in other bilateral and multilateral partnerships.   Metal based SOFC stack technology will improve functionality, reliability and reproducibility and reduce manufacturing cost of SOFC stacks, in particular for APU applications which require fast start up and thermal cycling, carbon containing fuel gas, high current density, chock vibration resistance, fast transients in electrical loads, and red-ox cycling. Current state-of-the-art anode-supported cells rely upon nickel/zirconia materials that will not be able to meet neither the technical requirements, nor the future allowable total cost for SOFC systems (such as the approximately 350 EUR per kilowatt).", 147086.0, 4793626.0, "METSOFC", null, null, null, null, "http://www.smt.sandvik.com/osprey", null, "fp7_88401_999491493"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1LY", "DWP ESF 2014-2020 Provision Leicester and Leicestershire", "Department for Work and Pensions (DWP CFO)", "The project will be employment and employability provision that will help those that furthest from the labour market in to sustained work in the key employment sectors in the Leicester and Leicestershire LEP area local labour market.
