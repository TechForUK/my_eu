An individual professional technique will also be studied during the 14-day course. The foreign host companies will nominate a tutor for the apprentices: this person will provide guidance, advice and training and will follow the progress of the young people during their mobility period. The above-mentioned Chambers of Trades and Crafts (CMA) will be in charge of implementing the call for applications and selecting the successful candidates amongst those apprentices interested in a period of mobility. They will furthermore be responsible for organising every aspect of the trip - logistics, travel, accommodation as well as producing written feedback on the experience that will, in particular, analyse the positive aspects and identify areas for improvement (impact assessment, giving out results, methods to improve future mobility periods).

The reality is that many times those groups of people with migrant background aren\u2019t involved well or at all in social and civic life of hosting communities, or they close themselves in groups with questionable aims and values. Youngsters with immigrant background miss many times opportunities offered by different local, national or European programs and projects because they aren\u2019t in touch with delivery entities (NGO\u2019s, Institutions, Universities, local and national bodies) and don\u2019t have access to this information, or don\u2019t trust it.\r\nFor raise of civic and social involvement of youth with migrant background, \u201cI.M.H.S. \u2013 Inclusion of Migrants in Hosting Society\u201d Project is aiming to improve the access to opportunities and participation at community life of the target group trough following objectives:\r\n\u2022 To develop 8 youth associative structures(Groups of People active in Youth work, Youth Clubs, NGO\u2019s) of people with migrant background in 8 different European countries;\r\n\u2022 To engage and empower youth workers and youth with immigrant background to be active in their community development ;\r\n\u2022 To create tools to develop youth work in disadvantaged communities in Europe: an international network of  associative structures of people with migrant background (Groups of People active in Youth work, Youth Clubs, NGO\u2019s) working in the field of social inclusion and active youth workers; a booklet with the activity of youth associative structures of people with migrant background and described ways and approaches in working with this group of youth; Erasmus+ opportunities.\r\nThe project will involve 8 partners representing 8 different European Countries: Greece, Bulgaria, former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Italy, Poland, Nederland (Sint Maarten) and United Kingdom.\r\nThe project \u201cI.M.H.S.\u201d addresses the topics of youth with fewer opportunities and disadvantaged communities in Europe.\r\nThe project is addressing the horizontal priority of the program, social inclusion. The project is empowering youth workers working with disadvantaged groups and youth with fewer opportunities to assume an active role in their community.

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) can offer an alternative: anyone is freely licensed to use FOSS, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared. The benefits of using FOSS can include decreasing software costs, increasing security and stability, protecting privacy, and giving users more control over their own hardware. \r\n\r\nTherefore the FOSS4SMEs project intends to equip European SMEs with the skills and competences to properly use Free and Open Source Software, so to improve their digital performances and competitiveness.\r\nTo reach this objective, the project intends to develop a free online educational resource for managers and staff of existing SMEs or start-ups, to allow them uptake the open software digital transformation.\r\nThe course will be freely available to individual students (managers and staff of SMEs) and will be used by public and private bodies providing support, consultancy and training to businesses, which will be able to organise training courses using the results of the project.\r\nThe project also aims to facilitate recognition and transferability of competences, thus mobility, by implementing the ECVET system to the professional profile of the FOSS Business User (FOSS-BU).\r\n\r\nIn total more than 300 end-users will be involved during the training activities: SMEs managers, business executive and staff, which represent the direct target group.\r\nThey will be involved first in a training gaps and motivation analysis, then in the assessment exercises, in view of its fine-tuning and final release. \r\nSMEs will be trained to be able to understand and recognise the full potential of open source for their business, so to be free to decide whether they want to use proprietary software or make a partial/full migration to FOSS.\r\nIn particular they will be trained in order to:\r\n\u2022 understand how to make the most of open source and select the solutions most relevant to the specific type of business\r\n\u2022 lead staff from across all areas of the business towards a more proactive use of ICT\r\n\u2022 set out a strategy to invest time and resources on the improvement of the digital performance of their company\r\n\u2022 develop business and operating models that are innovative and strategic \r\nIndirect target groups are VET providers and business support organisations (consultants, trainers, especially in the field of ICT).

The partnership emerged from a common problem of the three participating countries: high level of unemployment among low-skilled migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, especially marginalized women. These groups are either not eligible for governmental funded education opportunities or are difficult to reach and/or unwilling to commit to further education. \r\nTo became employable, these people need support not only in obtaining a recognized qualification and work experience in UK/ Italy/ Romania, but often they firstly need help in developing good literacy, numeracy, digital and media skills. \r\nUK has a high number of migrants from the EU and non-EU countries. Italy, and especially Sicily, is confronted with a huge number of African migrants who are often lacking opportunities for development and integration. Surprisingly even Romania is confronted with a double problem: not only the Romanian low skilled emigrants to Western Europe, who are often marginalized and discriminated, but also the immigrants from Russia, Ukraine or third world countries who are trying to make a living in Romania. This country is very unprepared for integrating the immigrants, and the support available for learning Romanian language or accessing qualifications is very low.  \r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. To understand the barriers to attainment in adult education for low-skilled migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, especially marginalized women in the three cities.\r\n2.
