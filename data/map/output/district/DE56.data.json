However, due to its high flammability and low charring nature, PP is difficult to fire protected. Whist brominated flame retardants (FRs) are able to achieve excellent FR performance at moderate cost and with little impact on polymer properties, they release toxic and corrosive smoke during fire, are potentially harmful to the environment and restrict PP recyclability. There is thus increased legislative and political pressure for a reduction in halogen FR use. Existing halogen free PP flame retardants are based on low performance & low cost mineral FR additives or high performance & high cost intumescent systems, both requiring high to moderate loadings thereby impacting on polymer properties and restricting use for high performance applications.\n\n\u2018Mixed intumescent polymeric salts\u2019 (MIPS) are a novel cost efficient high performance intumescent FR additive. Utilising phosphorous rich oligomers synthesised from readily available raw materials, the MIPS chemistry integrates the essential components for intumescence within one molecule, locked in a reaction state immediately preceding intumescence, thereby enabling:\n- High performance at reduced loading: Rapid and efficient intumescence at low temperatures achieving enhanced flame retardancy and smoke suppression;\n- Cost Competitiveness: Low cost additive manufacture combined with reduced loading enabling additive package pricing in-line with halogen based systems;\n- Superior physical and mechanical properties: non-particulate and oligomeric nature (melt blendable) and reduced loading levels, achieving significantly reduced impact on base polymer properties;\n\nPP-MIPS will further advance \u2018MIPS\u2019 as an intumescent fire protection chemistry for PP, targeting commercial competitiveness with halogen based FR systems and enabling their replacement for high performance applications. The PP-MIPS compounds will be demonstrated for two high profile case study applications: 1) halogen free UL94-V2 rated PP fibres; and 2) NFPA-262 rated cable insulation jackets.

These oil additives, through tribochemical interaction with the surface, produce nanostructured composite, self-healing and smart tribofilms at the surface. 2020 Interface involves the design of the complete system; functionalised Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) coating and future generation lubricant to enable the Europe\u2019s stretching targets in fuel economy and durability to be met. There has been much emphasis in research on designing new coatings technology such that the degree of complexity of surface systems has increased dramatically over the last decade. In boundary lubricated contacts, it is the interfacial nanostructured film, which results from tribochemical interactions between the surface and the lubricant additives, which dictates the system performance. No attempts have been made to incorporate \u201cdesign\u201d strategies into optimizing this interface and 2020 Interface tackles this through an interdisciplinary integrated experimental and theoretical approach. The benefits of this approach are accrued from substantial improved fuel economy (protection of natural resources), reduced emissions (protection of the environment) and improved durability (lower waste and maintenance). As the number of vehicles in the globe increases year on year without showing signs of reaching a plateau and the internal combustion engine remains the major platform for powertrain for the foreseeable future, the impact of this project will be large and long lasting. 2020 Interface brings together a world class consortium of 4 Universities, 1 research institute and 4 leading multinational companies from 8 EU countries together in complete supply chain to deliver fast track radical innovation in nanoscience through to a full set of novel lubrication technology platforms, for commercial applications in diesel and", 132361.0, 3283154.0, 7, 11, "2020 INTERFACE", null, "http://www.lubrizol.com", null, "fp7_93335_995282081"], [1217548800000, 1325289600000, "Demonstration of 2nd Generation Vegetable Oil Fuels in Advanced Engines", "Lubrizol Limited", "Pure vegetable oil use as engine fuel has the potential for the most comprehensive ecologic, economic and social benefits of all biofuels. The production involves few process steps and can be done economically with small production units. The production process has only small energy losses and provides potential for additional income generation on farms, thereby strengthening rural economic structures. The challenges to be met by pure vegetable oil are engine adaptation, fuel quality control, emissions control and limits to overall production potential. State-of-the-art concepts allow for achieving EURO3 emission levels for road vehicles in specifically adapted diesel engines for rape seed oil fitting to the German pre-norm DIN V 51605. However, advanced biofuels should allow that emissions keep within the limits of the forthcoming EURO6 norm for road vehicles and EU Stage 4 / US Final TIER4 for non-road vehicles. This proposal covers research and demonstration on 2nd generation vegetable oil fuels in advanced engines. It follows a double strategy: engines as well as the fuel are adapted such that both match and the combination allows for achieving high engine performance at minimum fuel consumption fitting with most severe emission limits. The objectives are (1) to widen the range of considered oils, (2) to research on and demonstrate additives for vegetable oils, (3) to research on and demonstrate improved engine oils, (4) to achieve EU stage 4 / US TIER4 emission levels in medium-scale demonstration fleets running in France, Austria, Germany and Poland, (5) to transfer the engine and fuel concepts to hybrid engines, allowing to achieve forthcoming EURO6 emission levels, (6) to prepare proposals for future fuel standards.

Our investigations will consider 6 areas ; culture, the environment, economy, sustainability, planning and development and finally alternative forms of tourism in the destinations. The main aims of the project, which are to promote not only our European partners', but also our own destinations, language, and culture to students will give them the opportunity to create and develop innovative ways of sharing their research, both in the real and virtual worlds, with 5 other partner schools. Project ideas and new friendships will be shared through both social networking sites, with project tasks ranging from making destination guide booklets, filming videos and creating magazines. We have included our 5 partner schools from all over Europe; north to south, east to west and have a diverse range of schools participating. Some schools bring vast experiences of multilateral partnerships whilst others are entirely new to the concept; allowing us to not only share best practice but provide an opportunity for innovation. The schools bring a wealth of knowledge to the project that match our 6 key themes.\r\n\r\nThe activities designed will be embedded into our schools curriculum and will also allow students to gain knowledge and understand of the 6 key areas, in preparation for creating their destination guide booklets. Activities throughout the project include students presenting from a business point of view, creating marketing strategies and suggesting ideas for revenue. They will then pitch their ideas to a panel in a \"Dragon's Den\" style activity that will enable them to develop the skills needed in the world of work. Students will also work in planning committee to design a new tourist attraction and must take responsibility for budgeting, designing and promoting their attraction. They will also create a display on greenways tourist trails and humorous sketches between a travel agent and clients will highlight the various types of alternative tourism. The project will also aim to educate students on the importance of tourism directed towards natural environments, intended to support conservation efforts and observe wildlife. \r\n\r\nThe project will be given an added dimension on foreign visits with countries further sharing national traditions and culture through activities such as an \"international picnic\" and the creation of a video on traditional items. To celebrate and commemorate the project, each country will design its own plimsole that encompasses the main themes of the project, here students will practice their teamworking skills. To measure the outcomes of the project firstly we will pre-evaluate the knowledge students have in the matter, during the development the activity will be evaluated in terms of keeping of timetable,  fulfilling of objectives and increasing of competence of students involved. This will be done through the use of academic performance indicators to measure if the students have improved their literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. We will also conduct interviews and questionnaires with staff, students and parents. Other methods of evaluation include observations, written text, media evidence and the number of staff and student mobilities. \r\n\r\nSome of our results will be intellectual through the work that the students produce and will improve not only their knowledge of European tourism destinations but also their knowledge of the 6 areas such as; the environment. They will also improve their skills in literacy, numeracy through these activities. Throughout this project, students will not only be able to develop the skills and attributes (such as good communication and teamwork, effective time management, careful planning, self- confidence, and independence) necessary to become successful in life after school, but they will also be challenged to look at situations from their partner's viewpoints, reflecting on the differences, but also the similarities that our countries have which ultimately bring us \u2018together\u2019.", "http://www.ecclesbourne.org.uk", "The Ecclesbourne School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000374_coordinator"]]}}}}
