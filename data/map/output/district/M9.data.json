This group of children are exposed to triple jeopardy through break-up of the family, financial hardship, and extremes of stigma and secrecy, leading to adverse social and educational repercussions. None of the four countries so far recognises the extreme disadvantage experienced by these young people. Support available, for example, in accessing prisons and participating in prison visits is extremely variable and mainly provided through non-governmental organisations. Support for imprisoned parents, whose moral authority is diminished through their incarceration, is equally inconsistent. The COPING research strategy places the clearest emphasis on knowledge obtained directly from children and young people. The project will commission surveys of 200 children in each country aged 11-16 with an imprisoned parent, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, to ascertain coping strategies and mental health problems for these young people, which will be compared with normative population samples. Smaller groups of children and parents will be involved in in-depth qualitative interviews to explore the impact of parental imprisonment and support services available in greater detail. Interventions to support these families will be comprehensively mapped. Children will play a prominent role in disseminating research results to policy makers and professional bodies Impacts of the COPING research will include improvements in information about this group of children; step changes in Government and public awareness about their plight; potential new legislation; and improvements in prison regimes to enable effective contact and visits for children to imprisoned", 122965.0, 3169483.0, "COPING", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_100488_994830061"], ["8GQ", "a universal thin film transistor platform for flexible and curved displays", "Smartkem Limited", "SKEM proposes a project which will accelerate the uptake of their flexible transistor platform technology (incorporating their proprietary organic semiconductor, truFLEX), into backplane drivers for the manufacture of flexible and curved electronic displays. SKEM\u2019s technology enables the low temperature processing of high performance transistors onto plastic for the first time. This allows mechanical flexibility to be combined with electronic performance previously only demonstrated by rigid inorganics, along with significant reductions to processing costs.\nThis will enable SKEM\u2019s customers to produce entirely new form factors for display-based consumer electronics: flexible, body conforming, lightweight, unbreakable devices with high resolution and low power consumption (longer battery lifetimes). This can be achieved with low risk to adoption, using refitted standard production lines. As a universal transistor platform, SKEM will supply the existing market for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), while also facilitating the new market for organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays.\nThe project will involve customer engagement (customers are already engaged in joint development work, showing commitment with signed Letters of Intent) and commercial planning (WP2), development of the technology platform to meet customer requirements (WP3), demonstration of the technology in full display devices (WP4) and preparation for commercial roll out, involving technology transfer to industrial process lines, and scale-up of truFLEX production (WP5). A strong regime of project management (WP1) dissemination and communication (WP6) will support the aims of the project. These developments will elevate the technology from initial demonstration in the relevant industrial application (TRL6 - first LCD demonstrator completed prior to project), to full commercial readiness after the project (TRL9).

The training will be facilitated through experiential Non-formal and participatory methods and world cafe methods will be used. The work group method will include walking though the minefield, Wheel of trust and Seed nurturing methods. The participation is broad and diverse including participants from Italy, Portugal, U.K, Ukraine, Norway ,Spain, Poland and Romania.  The participants targeted are youth workers, youth leaders and youth managers and youth leaders from disadvantaged background. The design of the content of the training project was carried out through pre-project consultations around the theme of the training in other  to be sure that the contents mirrors some of the expectations of potential participants. The training will help youth workers and young people to engage with the multifaceted dimensions of integration with a view to creating a society that is devoid of discrimination ,stereotype and xenophobia but to create a much more equal and inclusive Europe. This kind of broad understanding of European integration by young people will nip in the bud and bit back the rise of extreme nationalism and xenophobia tendencies within the borders of Europe. A broad understanding of integration among the youth will deny recruits and converts to the political rhetoric of new physical borders and slam brakes on the unintended consequences of a two tier Europe demarcated based on GDP and economic indexes as currently seen as northern Europeans and Southern Europeans. Objectives of the project is;\r\n- To promote a society of equal opportunities \r\n-To promote a society that is devoid of discrimination and Xenophobia.\r\n- To promote alternative narrative beyond the market and trade defined integration. \r\n-To train young people on how to engage with diversity and how to function effectively and compete in a multicultural Europe. \r\n-To train 32 youth workers from partners countries on multiculturalism and leveraging diversity\r\nThe training methods will be non-formal training methods. This project will address the flawed perspective of reducing European citizens to  just a number on the GDP scale and then try to use that illustration to measure the success of integration. The partners involved in the project is broad and diverse with complimentary skills. The project will be part of the efforts to gradually begin to turn the corner of debate and understanding of young people about the true picture of integration and what is it mean in the near future. This project will be one of the major steps to confront misinformation of integration not with violence or aggression but with robust knowledge and informed perspectives.", null, "CENTRE FOR POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-002306_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M9"}
