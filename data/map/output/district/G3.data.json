It addresses doctoral supervision as the core component in doctoral education, proposing a balanced set of measures to improve supervision on a practical level (addressing institutions and students), a strategic level (addressing membership organisations), and on an advocacy level (addressing stakeholders and policy makers). The members of the project consortium, led by the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, come from all artistic fields (fine arts, media arts, performative arts, architecture and design, music, art theory) ensuring a transnational and transdisciplinary perspective of supervision in artistic research. The strategic partnership includes various European institutions in order to take into account a comprehensive range of national and local frameworks, and it includes members from different types of art universities, ensuring the validity of the project findings for all institutional contexts.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to closely investigate six areas in which tools and measures will be created to advance doctoral supervision in artistic research: \r\n(1) defining supervision (supervision vs. other concepts like mentoring, coaching, etc.); \r\n(2) ethical dimensions in supervision; \r\n(3) new competencies for supervisors; \r\n(4) professional education for supervisors (training); \r\n(5) the art of giving feedback in artistic research (transdisciplinarity); \r\n(6) the role of the research environment for supervision. \r\n\r\nThe four intellectual outputs dealing with these issues take on the formats of mind maps, handbooks, online tool kits, briefing scenarios, a training concept as well as a comprehensive final publication on \"Undoing Supervision| A Non-normative Guide on Key Issues in Supervising Artistic Research Doctorates\", which will document and summarise all project findings in the format of an e-book with interactive elements.

The project intends to fill the need of new teaching ways in music, especially in the most susceptible age group of children (5-10 ys), who usually receive 1 music lesson/week from the general class teacher who have no skills and training to teach specialized subjects, and have a very vague music repertory (except some specialised music primary schools in Hungary).  There is no modern curriculum or specific content for music education in primary schools yet. The current teaching methodology is based on  the passive attitude of the pupils, focuses too much on theory rather than creating an atmosphere where the kids can actively be involved in music making, while having a \u201cpositive flow\u201d. That\u2019s why currently music lessons are among the most denied and disliked subjects. Why should anyone like or make music, is there any benefit? Why is it important to start music education in early childhood? The key is the proven benefits of music, the so called \u201cmusical transfer effect\u201d. Those children who receive appropriate music education in their early ages will have more developed cognitive functions, linguistic, arithmetic skills, fine motoric capabilities, will possess a more open social attitude, more autonomous thus flexible personality compared to those children who received no music education. Therefore the stake is the quality of our future society. The innovation of our approach lies in the new approach of two new models which connect creative movements with singing and music listening, as well as applying elements of the pedagogy of Klara Kokas, a Kodaly alumna, who developed a new, children-focused holistic approach combining music listening with free movements.  The two models truly reflect the findings of how active participation in music making, be it through instinctive movements, improvisation, etc. enhances the understanding, absorption of music. A recently finished pilot scientific study in Hungary serves as a starting point for the job of creating new didactics based on these models. In parallel the critical review of the current learning materials and music repertoires used in primary schools will be completed along with importing new pieces. The pieces have to serve the needs of the children of the digital era, to help their joyful involvement in music lessons, via using carefully selected, high-quality music listening materials of various genres with analysis, authentic folk pieces of the given countries, singing games and choreographies. This will be executed by experts and students of the 3 HEI partners, the first steps being done through Intensive Programmes in each seat.  The materials (cca 900 items by the end) will be tested in a population of children of primary school age and their teachers coming from partner institutions who have been invited by the HEIs in each countries. These partners (HU: a primary school, NL: Vocaal Talent, SC: NYCoS) have children choirs as well as CPD programmes, so the testing procedure could be extended to practising teachers, too.A new IOS platform based app (KODA) developed specifically for music teachers with features like games for developing musical writing, reading skills, and a lesson-planner will be used. The third intellectual output is a special platform, the Kod\u00e1ly-hub which will be designed to meet the unique needs of music educators. All other  intellectual outputs will be uploaded to the Kod\u00e1ly-hub throughout the project and will be made publicly available. This hub will act as a center for updated music education information, methodology, didactics, it will be open for new partners, countries to upload new contents, good practices upon a careful professional pre-check of the materials\u2019 confirmity to the Kod\u00e1lyian principles.

RTRIT is involved in various projects aimed to support learners with fewer opportunities, those of social, economic risk or lack of family support and to reduce number of early school leavers. For this project it opens opportunity to identify risk group and fewer opportunity youngsters and to invite them as participants. There are also students with special needs who have positive learning results and will be involved in international mobility. \r\nFollowing mobilities that have significant role in international development of RTRIT, are to be carried out in this project as described in the internationalization strategy:\r\n1) Long term mobilities of qualification training for last year students. CHASE network have mutually agreed upon exchange of the learners, quality measures of training programs, and developed training evaluation system for catering and hospitality fields according to ECVET that will be fully compatible with education systems working with ECVET. Mobility trainings realized within this project will be evaluated by the newly developed system.\r\n2) 3-5 week long mobilities for various training programs in different sectors and host organizations.  Mobility flows in Denmark are carried out as modules of education programs. Learning outcomes are assessed by ECVET tools and are recognized in RTRIT.  Also 4-week mobilities to Kaunas and 3-week to Tartu VEC will be done as modules and assessed by ECVET.  \r\n3) 2 week Mobilities addressing the needs of learners who are facing learning difficulties, losing learning motivation or are on the edge to be disclosed of voluntary leaving the education process.  In cooperation with partner-schools from Kaunas and Tartu mobility programs are specially designed to strengthen personality, develop social and communication skills, and raise learning motivation. These mobilities involve necessary accompanying persons that will support learners practically and mentally during the mobility. Considering previous experience these mobilities will be carried out in smaller groups. \r\n4) Mobility of teachers and staff involving a) development of professional skills that will be used in further work after mobility, b) demonstration of skills and sharing experience to rise the status or the school in on international level.\r\n5) In order to renew cooperation with Turkish school, that was inactive due to internal political situation, and carry our Erasmus PRO mobilities, one advance planning visit will be carried out for staff member who is involved in preparing outgoing mobilities. \r\nTotal number of learners to be involved in mobility is planned according to the VET Mobility Charter and composes ~5% of total number of learners in RTRIT.

The school conducts Higher Vocational Education in Travel & Tourism and Hospitality, Accounting and Finance, Health and Welfare, Retail, and IT. The number of students at the school is just over 700, there are 22 permanently employed staff, and 60 to 80 contracted staff working with education. The project is linked to the EU\u2019s educational policy goals; at least 40% of all 30-34 year-olds should have completed tertiary education. The project is timely with regard to EU goals \u2013 Higher Vocational Education in Sweden has never before been allocated so many places. The political direction is clear \u2013 there is a strong commitment to HVE. \r\n \r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to obtain more knowledge about EU tools, and to gain better insight into the overall goals set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy for Higher Education. Knowledge is needed about SeQF, EQF and how ECVET can be implemented concerning credit transfer. Staff will gain knowledge by learning how tasks are performed, taught and assessed in Europe within the professional roles that students are educated for at Frans Schartau. Further aims of the project are to see how the European dimension can be reflected in the curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for students is to provide them with international professional experience, and increased language skills as requested by the labour market. One consequence of mobility is that employability increases while strengthening the student\u2019s ability to work in an international labour market. Through exchange, students get the opportunity to acquire key competencies such as communicating in another language, learning new technologies that increase digital skills. Living in another country leads to the development of social, personal and cultural skills, and by participating in exchange projects a person\u2019s capacity to take initiative is stimulated. \r\n \r\nThree members of staff with experience of international cooperation will organise the project. Well-established activities and methods have been planned for some time. After starting up the project and implementation with staff and students, work will progress according to the Activity Plan that also includes theme days, help with writing CVs, and that each participant prepares themself by examining specific areas in the recipient country. \r\n\r\nFive different professional areas of work at the school will be represented among the 14 employees participating in mobility to obtain a comprehensive result. Staff should be in the position to immediately apply their new skills to benefit students and promote work on internationalization at the school. The 25 students participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across the various areas of work. Students must have a good communicative ability to be able to pass on what they have learnt after their Work Placements. After selection, mobility goals will be anchored with the host organization or company and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\nThe intended outcome is that the school should be at the forefront of internationalization work. There will be more knowledge within the organization about professional roles seen from a European perspective. The knowledge acquired will give courses and teaching at the school an international dimension, increase knowledge of SeQF, EQF and ECVET as well as ensuring that international Work Placements maintains high quality.\r\n\r\nThe school is part of the City of Stockholm, which organizes education at all levels so that circulation of results will be via the City's Intranet and in the newsletter. The companies (about 100) linked to the school\u2019s various steering groups as well as industry organizations within the various fields of education will be invited to participate in breakfast meetings and theme days in order to gain access to the school\u2019s internationalization work. All niche companies that the school works with will have access to a workforce that has international experience.\r\n\r\nOnce the entire project has been completed, Frans Schartau Business Institute will have strengthened international cooperation in Higher Vocational Education in Europe, which will facilitate future work on implementation of ECVET. If the project is carried out full-scale, in addition to the contacts made through staff skills development, it will also have included supervisors from 40 companies in Europe whereby knowledge and insights are spread further.

The iPerho e-learning campus, which is being developed during the project, supports and enables the students' individual learning paths to be realized. All students have a Personal Competence Development Plan (HOKS), which is updated during the studies. A module for international exchange serving students will be built for the campus, where the student receives information about the exchange and where the services are provided digitally, for example chat, blogs and guidance. The module works as a connecting contact platform where students can exchange experiences with each other and receive guidance. The iPerho e-learning campus will provide modules for core subjects, that students can also complete abroad, which speeds up their graduation. The on-the-job learning teacher is pedagogically present at the iPerho e-learning campus, where communication, guidance and evaluation will be documented.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the National Consortium is to produce a common process for the international Personal Competence Development Plan in accordance with the legislation on the reform of vocational education and training. The implementation and evaluation of HOKS will be ensured by Advance Planning Visits.\r\n\r\nThe international network's assessment competence (materials, guidance, evaluation and evaluation documentation) is guided in the directions required by Ecvet and the reform of vocational education,  especially taking into account the Learning Agreement for student's personal learning objectives and in particular ensuring their realization. The Consortium works as a mentor for the CHASE network partners, who do not have any experience and knowledge of Ecvet.\r\n\r\nPerho, Stao and REDU offer 5, 4 and 3 months ErasmusPro long term mobilities for 44 students (restaurant, bakery, tourism and business) in the CHASE network. A long on-the-job learning enables new working methods and raw materials, language and work culture to be learned. What is new in this project is that exchanges are also offered for adult learners / apprentices. The project's reciprocal 5 and 4-month student exchanges are started in all countries simultaneously in two different flows during the academic year. Both flows will be started in the host country by a four-week language and cultural preparation organized by the host institution, after which the host institution will organize a supervised on-the-job learning for students.  At the end of the period, the students complete 1-3 professional skills demonstrations. The project makes use of Europass Certificate Supplement, Europass CV and Europass Mobility Document.\r\n\r\nThe project will provide 10 teachers and other staff with a 1 and 3-week  mobility period.  The digital skills, international competence, linguistic and cultural know-how as well as guidance skills develop through the training abroad. Advance Planning visits are organized to partners, where there is a need to ensure the realization of the student's Personal Competence Development Plan.\r\n\r\nThe CHASE network has a total of  200-300 student and staff mobilities during the academic year.", "http://www.lightonthepath.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA102-046991_8"], [2018, "ECVET phase 3, integration, apprenticeships/traineeships, Europass Mobility.

In the project they will be able to discucss integration, democratic values, placements for students, apprenticeship models, school systems, entrepreneurial learning, and reflect on the difficulties students might face in another culture and at a workplace in the host country.\r\nThe project will introduce the students to a European labour market to counteract unemployment among young people and to inspire to entrepreneurial learning and work.\r\nCommunication language is English, for both students and teachers, which will enhance the language skills. The participants become more interested in learning other languages and about other cultures. The understanding and tolerance towards other cultures increases, even in the home country, which counteracts racism. The students compare their culture and work place culture with the host country, which makes them more aware of pros and cons in both countries. They will be involved in discussions about democratic values; hierarchies, equality, gender equalty, integration, and will also be offered lessons in entrepreneurial learning to inspire them to new ideas and show opportunities for starting up their own businesses both in the home country, but also in Europe.\r\nThe students get more mature and learn to take responsibility living away from home and solving problems, that might oocur. They develop as professionals and will be more employable both at home and in Europe, to a certain extent due to the networks they create themselves with young people at the host school and with people at the placements.

They deepen their knowledge and critical thinking when meeting various cultures and migrants at the host school and learn how they are integrated in the organisations. The project helps the participants to understand the difficulties, that might occur for migrants to adapt to a new country, but highlights also problems, that can occur for our students to adapt to a new culture and work culture at placements.  The project presents a European Labour market to the students to prevent unemployment among youngsters, where one, in spite of background, has a chance for employment.

Meeting another language and culture increases understanding and tolerance for other cultures, also at home. The interest to learn other languages, except English, increases among the participants. The students compare their culture with their host country, which makes them more aware of pros and cons between the countries. They study equality, gender equality, migration, integration, etnicity and religion, in their host country, which  increases their critical thinking in a positive way along with understanding migrants in Europe, and other cultures back home.The students mature and become more responsible. They develop their professional skills, which make them better employees both at home and in Europe.

Our European partners appreciate our wide range of industrial and service fields and are interested in the reciprocity of placements. The entire project involves candidates who must acquire and prove versatile professional skills in their sector.  They also need to experience the European dimension through the Erasmus Program. We have to underline that such a program couldn\u2019t be achieved without the help of Europe\r\n\r\nThe objectives respect the recommendations of the EU commission, our decision to offer that chance to the students and staff meets the professional needs of the participants but also their EU recommendations. The content of the working program has been agreed on by all the partners and they are committed to respect the stages of the project. These stages will imply a vast panel of people\r\nThe role of each partner is perfectly clear. The GIPAL carries the project. The Rectorat manages the project. It has a long experience of the programme and it will support the vocational schools all along the project. The piloting committee is in charge of developing the project, insuring the follow-up, the management and the evaluation of the project. The latter also has to check the financial balance and controls that the various actors meet their commitments. The sending organizations will respect the terms of the mobility program of the consortium. They are in charge of the monitoring and evaluation of the participants\r\n\r\nThe young people will be more efficient on the job market, they will enrich their professional, cultural and linguistic skills, they will see Europe differently, they will improve their skills in ICT, they will be more autonomous, become aware of the similarities and differences of the working methods, prove their ability to adapt and integrate into a new environment, get the Europass, the Europro and the opportunity to get a bonus for their baccalaureate. The schools will develop a network of training organizations, a partnership \u201ccompany-school\u201d at the European level, exchange innovative practices and give a new image to vocational schools. They\u2019ll get the accreditation for quality award Label Lyc\u00e9e des M\u00e9tiers, increase the attractivity of their schools, decrease the rate of school-leaving pupils. Expected impact: renewal and sustainability of the project in 2019. The staff will improve their professional skills, enrich their educational practices, exchange skills and discover other education systems. Expected impact: improvement of the professional, practical and theoretical skills. For the learners, it will be an undeniable professional added value which will be transformed into assets on the job market and it will offer career developments to the staffs involved in the project\r\n\r\nThese impacts are tangible and easily measurable. All the partners will be asked to transmit and promote the Erasmus program in addition to proceed at the global evaluation of this program. This evaluation will aim to analyse positive and/or negative points and allow to adjust our practices for next projects.

These actions support the school\u2019s vision and strengthens and promotes sustainable development such as understanding and respecting multiculturalism and diversity. Internationality is a natural part of everyday school activities. Students' capacity for internationalization and international mobility is supported, which also promotes the rise of organization's level of know-how. Work placements abroad enable different kinds of learning environments and individual learning pathways for students. Incoming international students bring in know-how and increase the internationalization in the school. Organization\u2019s strategy for internationalization includes finding new partnerships and increasing possibilities for international mobility to meet the students\u2019 increasing interest and need for international experience. The development discussions of the staff have shown that teachers have gaps in international expertise, as well as the need for language skills and IT skills development. Also ECVET knowledge is insufficient, consequently the teachers familiar with the principles of ECVET before the exchange period. Teachers are trained to use electronic means like Skype in accordance with the development plan for the staff, which enables for example vocational skills demonstration assessment in real-time for students abroad. The curriculum team's task is to develop the international dimension of the curriculum and make reforms according to Ecvet.The project is coordinated by Helsinki Culinary School Perho while Helsinki Vocational College and Lapland Tourism College are acting as domestic partners. The project is carried out with the International CHASE Network, which consists of 22 hospitality and catering colleges around Europe. Most of the colleges act both as a sending and a receiving partner. The Network has been operating for 25 years and represents a wide range of different language and cultural areas. From the gastronomic point of view, the colleges represent traditional European regional gastronomy. Gaining know-how and skills from the traditional European gastronomy strengthens the participants\u2019 possibilities for employment and success in labor market.The participants of the project are teachers and primary and upper secondary based students, who study a vocational qualification. The two-year project provides 40 students with the possibility of 4-5 months exchange and 14 teachers with 12 days, and 2 teachers with 5 weeks training abroad. The student exchange consists of a 4 -week language and cultural training in the host college and of on-the-job learning. During the exchange period the students learn skills needed in the internationalizing working life in addition to the professional skills. International work skills include different languages, networking and acting in a multicultural environment as well as different working cultures and customs. The skills and learning outcomes acquired abroad are validated and recognized as part of the qualification. The project makes use of Europass Certificate Supplement, Europass CV and Europass Mobility Document.The teacher training abroad strengthens professional skills and international competences. Teacher exchanges aim to take place in the same restaurants, where the students are placed. This will strengthen the assessment know-how in the work placements towards the ECVET-principles. The assessment documents tested in the previous project will be developed further. The teacher exchange takes place, when the students start their on-the-job learning. Teachers familiarize the staff in the work placement with the vocational skills demonstrations and the assessment targets such as the knowledge, the skills and the  competence of the student. The teacher organizes the vocational skills demonstration assessment via Skype in the end of the student\u2019s on-the-job leaning.In the annual collaboration meeting The CHASE network agreed on a common project theme ECVET. Members of the network are in very different levels in terms of ECVET both in know-how and practical experience. Helsinki Culinary School Perho and Helsinki Vocational College have been co-operating to develop international mobility actions already for 8 years.

The Network has since expanded to include 18 partners, 15 different countries and our school has been an active member for 15 years.Every exchange runs for a period of 5 months. Students are guided and assisted by one of the partnerschools. Every country selects, sends and receives students (except Iceland, Scotland and Tenerife,  they only receive). During the first month of their stay, students get acquainted with their hosts and the country. A very thorugh language course is combined with cultural excursions, company visits and practical lessons in the hosting school.At all times during their stay, students are assisted and guided by one of the local coordinators or teachers. After the first month follows a 4 month internship in one of the companies, hotels or restaurants selected by the hosting school. During this period the students remain in close contact with their hosts and their own school. For many of them this is their first long stay abroad and the contact with a known partner works both motivating and reassuring. The very important personal contact between the schools is equally important as it allows for quick and easy communication (in case any problems arise).Beside the long term project we started a short term project. The students themselves are the requesting party . Some of them would like to do their practical work-placement abroad during their last school-year.

Proof of intercultural skills and experiences are gaining increasingly importance for the successful transfer into employment. This is especially true for the service sector and skilled craft and trade related sector as well - which are the occupations of our target group. But in cause of the socio-economic situation of our target group  those young people do face considerable obstacles when it comes to the acquisition of work experience abroad. There is considerable danger for them that this lack of opportunity and hence experience and key skills will result in a life defining disadvantage and / or exclusion regarding future job chances.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, a stay abroad holds especially for young people with precarious socio-economic background the first opportunity to try and develop an indipendent lifestyle out of the framework of their family and social structures. Following the feedback of those who benefit from work related international exchange programmes, those youg people experience considerable personal growth, feel more empowered and more purposeful in regard of their vocational perspective than they felt before their departure. At the same time they felt more intercultural tolerant and more affirmative towards the European Project. In respect thereof the \"Leinen los!\" project is making an important contribution to the fight against ethnic, social and gender related discrimmination and towards the promotion of a european citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the project 30 students of vocational schools  (age 18 - 29) who are in training for a cereer in skilled craft and trade or servcie jobs (i.e. baker, salesmen, confectioner, stylists, hairdresser, childcare worker) will be offered the opportunity for a month-long internship and work experience in Spain, Great Britain, Austria or Ireland. This is meant to give those young people the chance to acquire work related international and intercultural skills to facilitate an easier transfer into the domestic and european labor market.

We will target the 2 groups of 6 recent graduates form VET-schools pre-dominantly when they enter the social benefits system. \r\n\r\nJ2W2 from Werkcenter Scotland (WS) and its Model, the 1-2-3 methodology (\"EU Good Practice 2006, 2012 & 2014')  will deliver work experience to recent graduates from VET schools as they are asked by potential employers about their work experience before they even have the chance to obtain any work experience. \r\n\r\nWS & the approach of the host organisation Dutch Foundation of Innovation Welfare 2 Work (DFOIW2W) is used to support and guide recent graduates in getting & improving new knowledge, skills and qualifications to facilitate personal development and responsibility to obtain basic  work experience & qualifications and/or participation on the local, national and EU labor market.\r\nDFOIW2W is a very experienced partner in YfEj & From Work to Work and is specifically chosen for their apprenticeships  and specialization in the Dutch Rotterdam area. DFOIW2W has an educational social inclusion approach & they use person-centered planning & action-based learning processes. DFOIW2W has a very broad range of apprenticeships in the fields of Welfare, Work, Income, Health & Care & Public Affairs. WS will tackle passivity, youth unemployment in J2W2 & aim to reduce the number of recent graduates without a job on a small scale. We place recent graduates on a structured J2W. WS & DFOIW2W both have extensive international experience with similar projects.\r\n\r\nThe 1-2-3 Methodology of WS has 3 phases:\r\nAssessment (1): 4-8 weeks (Preparation)\r\nDevelopment (2): 6 weeks (Internship)\r\nJob Mediation (3): 4-20 weeks (Job Mediation)\r\n\r\nIn the assessment phase the preparation training J2W2 takes place. This is required to get the recent graduates from VET-schools ready for the internships abroad, a young person who demonstrates correct behaviour will be rewarded and allowed to the Development Phase in NL. This is then followed up by  a further intensive  welfare to work programme delivered by CCP on the young person's return to Scotland. \r\n\r\nUpon returning to UK, WS expects (partly based on experience with the YfEj & FW2W-project) the following results: \r\n- 70% of the started recent graduates from VET schools will positively sustain the assessment phase. Under the conditions as described earlier they will be fit to travel to NL as a form of incentive.\r\n - 90% of the recent graduates from VET schools doing work placements in NL will return to UK with work experience & are 'job ready' to enter the labour market\r\n- 75% of the project recent graduates from VET schools who have successfully completed the project will still be at work 1 year after completion of the project\r\n - 100% of the project participants will be evaluated.\r\nSee also ANNEXES as regards to memorandum of Understanding, Service Level Agreement, implementation plan, and work activities abroad (in the Netherlands)...", "http://www.werkcenterscotland.org.uk", "Werkcenter Scotland Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012908_coordinator"], [2018, "Erasmus+ Mobility 2018-20", "LIGHT ON THE PATH LTD", 41837.0, 3, 3, "Lillerudsgymnasiet is an upper secondary school for natural resources specialized in horses, animal care, farming and science.

We believe that international experience is of high value on the labour market. Since 2015 we give our students the opportunity, through Erasmus+ mobility, to do part of their workplace based learning in Scotland or Ireland. It has proved successful and the students experience  improved knowledge of their job and positive personal development. \r\n\r\nWith Erasmus+ Mobility we have the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. A wider understanding of the world and the conditions for natural resources in Europe. This will enhance international cooperation which is important to solve some of the international challenges we are facing, such as food  and energy supply.\r\n\r\n2. Since three years our school has an explicit goal to work with sustainable development in all areas at our school; teaching content, farm work, school restaurant, cleaning etc. It also plays a major part in our cooperation projects with our partner schools in Uganda.  In our Erasmus+ project our intention is now to let the students do project work on sustainability issues at their workplace. This will then be reported back to students and staff at Lillerudsgymnasiet. Thus, the objective is to improve our knowledge of sustainable development.\r\n\r\n3.

The sector is growing rapidly and needs to keep and grow the staff it can get.  Catering Mobility in Europe will create a set of ambassadors in the sector who are students, apprentices, graduates within a year or staff doing vocational qualifications. They will have the will to take a leap out of their comfort zones and see a new side of the hospitality sector that will propel them forwards in their careers. This leap will have at its heart a 5 week mobility in Amsterdam (2 people), Tenerife (2 people), Gothenburg (1) or Helsinki (1) to first gain cultural and local food knowledge alongside further language lessons over 4 weeks at hotel and restaurant schools and then do a four month placement in a 4 or 5 star hotel from October to February, including over the busy holiday season.  The learning they gain will fit with their qualifications and will cover soft skills, cultural awareness and adaptablilty, and kitchen and cooking experience specfiic to the host country.  The participants will be part of the Consortium of Hospitality and Accommodation Schools in Europe (CHASE) network's well-established model of learning and will share their experience with fellow learners from several other CHASE partners' countries. This will give them learning support and connections with young people from many European countries, in addition to the host country and establish them as citizens of Europe.While the participants are learning and working, they will be writing blogs and social media posts about their experiences and insights which will be shared around the Hospitality Industry Trust Scotland's wide membership of hospitality employers, as well as Glasgow Restaurant Association members and many other networks for people working in hospitality.   While writing these blogs on cultural differences, local seasonings and the links to culture, recipes and the tourism sights, they will be acting as ambassadors for Scotland to their host countries and sharing their experiences with the sector back home, taking a step up in their career ambitions.While the participants are gaining passion for the hospitality and sharing it widely with their new discoveries, the consortium partners in Scotland will be learning about catering mobilities and making contacts in other countries.  Light on the Path are well established hosts of shorter European placements and sending unemployed people on placements, Catering Mobility in Europe will give them experience of hospitality and longer placements, while establishing many new partnerships. HIT Scotland offers scholarships and bursaries for local and international short courses outside the EU but this will be new for them and give them new contacts and insights, as well as getting to work closely with the participants. Marriott Hotels is very active in staff development but has not been able to offer international placements to the EU for its developing staff and this will allow them to boost their connections and gain extra-passionate staff to inspire others and provide excellent services. Receiving partners in each country will get to know Scottish students and partners be able to send their own students to Scotland with their own projects.The project's participants will feed their experience into a flow of news while they are away, inspiring people working in the sector and thinking about working in the sector.  When they return, they will help to plan and deliver a dissemination event to high-level leaders in the hospitality sector, students and colleges, so that their excitement and discoveries can be spread.  The consortium partners and their networks will also promote the opportunity for the participants to do outreach visits on their return to inspire more people and share their stories.The end of the project aims to be the beginning of a long series of opportunities for more people in the sector to gain an international outlook on hospitality and their careers, to inspire others and to grow in their careers - both in Scotland and potentially elsewhere in Europe.

Well, because somebody who grows up being a social media native, doesn\u2019t make them an expert in using social media at work or getting a job. While businesses are racing head-on into the social media arena, the contemporary young workforce is still seriously ill-equipped to help unlock its value. And that value is simply enormous. An estimated three-quarters of consumers now say social media influences their buying decisions. Nearly 90% of companies are currently using Twitter, Facebook, and other networks. So while social media races ahead, formal training and education programs for young people are lagging seriously behind or are completely lacking. \u2018Finding a Job by Being Socially Media Fabulous (Brand Savvy)\u2019, would be an exciting opportunity to build and upgrade your personal brand and your social media skills and experience.

A professional digital identity is the first step to gain any kind of formal work experience which will lead to a substantial improvement of career development.

Although English Football League Clubs play a major role in producing national players, Premier League Clubs are the highest recruiters of players and coaches from abroad, with 46.8% of players recruited internationally and only 7 British Managers for the 20 Premier League Clubs. Consequently, English players and coaches are the least represented in the other European Leagues, highlighting a clear reluctance or inability of English players to attain First Team opportunities abroad. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nLSE and its partners see European mobility as an invaluable way to address two of the key areas identified by the England Commission to enhance the quality of English footballers and coaches. The project aims to tackle the lack of quality coaching by integrating the BTEC/NVQ developed at the Academy with innovative elements from the Bozsik Elite Programme (founded in Hungary) by sending the academies to GLOBALL Football Park and Sporthotel in Telki, Hungary. They will undertake daily training sessions and progress will be monitored through use of video analysis and daily diaries. It is expected that the mobility will contribute to the improvement of the apprentice players skills whilst broadening their employment opportunities, allowing them to become more competitive within the English market and/or being able to pursue a career abroad. \r\n\r\nBeing subject to new training methodologies and elements of dance in the host country, the aim is that the apprentices will be pushed out of their comfort zone and have a desire to expose themselves to what were typically seen as unattainable opportunities. The project will be of primary importance to the staff, considering that very few coaches currently employed within UK Academies go on to achieve First Team coaching roles at the top tier of National Football and are often reluctant/unprepared to obtain similar opportunities abroad. It will enhance their coaching curriculum and will help them to transfer knowledge shared by their Hungarian counterparts into the UK coaching system.\r\n\r\nNR. AND PROFILES OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nA group comprised of 22 players and 6 staff from the Under 18 teams of each of the consortium Academies will participate in the project.

The experience of training in UEFA and FIFA recognised training centres will set the standards they need to achieve and the focus will not be limited to progressing their footballing career in UK, but also career opportunities at European and International level. Those who do not make the transition to a professional playing career are still four times more likely to be offered employment than those who have not undertaken mobility.\r\n \r\nThe project will broaden the coaching skills of participating staff, introducing them to new knowledge detailed in the Bozsik Elite Programme. Coaches undertaking the mobility abroad will receive an influential set of practical skills and knowledge from the mobility, allowing them to deliver enhanced qualitative football training to their apprentices, whilst boosting the quality of their colleagues at the Academy through a series of internal training sessions and seminars. As with the young apprentices, working in UEFA and FIFA recognised facilities will enhance their motivation and dedication to work, reinforcing their ambitions on career progression, either in the UK and abroad. \r\n\r\nThe mobility will represent a model for acquiring new knowledge that they can replicate in the future to further enhance their expertise.\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nEach participating Academy will benefit from innovative training methods that they can apply at their UK base to produce superior players who can play regularly for the First Team or for other professional teams, in the UK or abroad.

It is believed that young players do not possess the required skills to protect themselves when falling to the ground as a consequence of a tackle, increasing the possibility of getting injured. To date, an elite sportsman must be able to combine his athletic and technical training with mental coaching. Coaching in this sense is the process by which individuals and groups of people are helped to achieve the highest level of their performance skills. This is more apparent in sport, where the mental aspects of motivation and focus play an even more important role. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThis mobility sets out to enhance the professional and soft skills of participants from Gloucester Rugby, Ospreys Rugby and Ayr Rugby Academy. The project aims at providing innovative training sessions to rugby apprentice players, involving the use of parkour and mental strength sessions. The modules on parkour aim at enhancing the agility skills of the young players; the modules on mental strength coaching aim at revolutionise the connection between mind and body, to boost athletes\u2019 performances in training and matches. Part of the mental strength sessions will target coaches, to help them recognise and address the different needs for development of their players, assisting them maturing as individuals and as players.\r\n\r\nNR. AND PROFILES OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nThe three Rugby Clubs have selected their U18 squads to participate in this mobility as they strongly believe that the described programme can enhance their chances of becoming professional Rugby players, encouraging them to undertake overseas experiences and refine the profile of those apprentices who may decide not to pursue a playing career. Indeed in this final phase of their compulsory education pathway, apprentices need concrete working and training experiences which would allow them to understand the final steps they need to make to successfully secure a position in the world of work. \r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF EXPECTED RESULTS\r\nThis project will have a considerable positive impact on all the organisations involved, widening their theoretical and practical knowledge of coaching methodologies and organisational models. Transnational cooperation commonly brings many advantages to all participants: Ospreys Rugby, Gloucester Rugby and Ayr Rugby will improve their coaching methodologies by integrating additional modules deriving from the discipline of parkour, which will enhance the physical, physical, psychological skills of their Academy players. Petrarca Rugby has already saw modules of parkour integrated into the existing training programme, which produced tangible positive results on the  skills of their apprentices and helped the Academy tackle the number of injuries. Both sending organisations will have track records of results (those recorded by Petrarca Rugby) for comparison, and an open line of communication for further assistance.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, visiting players will test a new approach to mental strength thanks to the method developed and implemented by Mauro Bergamasco. This will allow staff at both sending organisations to enhance the efficacy and efficiency of the training while respecting each player\u2019s personal development pace, with cascade benefits on performances of the Academy teams. As already demonstrated by growing scientific literature, mental strength sessions applied since younger ages can greatly assist players developing into professionals. Another beneficial aspect of mental strength sessions is helping players recovering faster and better from injuries and setbacks, either it is applied at individual or at team level.\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL LONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nThe fact that Ospreys Rugby,Gloucester Rugby and Ayr Rugby also participate in Continental competitions represents a multiplier factor to encourage European Rugby Clubs to follow in the pathway of transnational cooperation in order to develop their coaching methodologies as well. In the long term, the European Rugby industry as a whole should benefit from the example set by this Mobility project as participants will understand the demands of a cross-cultural experience, making them a more attractive candidate to further education institutions, local and European rugby clubs and future employers alike.\r\n\r\nFurther additional benefits will be achieved by Rugby Clubs and participants discussing about their overseas experience with their own communities of fans and friends, reporting on the formative educational experiences made available by the European Union.", "http://www.liberoagency.com", "Libero Sport and Education Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047307_coordinator"], [2017, "Away Goals Count Double: Score Yours Through EU Mobility!", "Libero Sport and Education Limited", 308500.0, 2, 2, "CONTEXT/BACKGROUND\r\nCentre International d\u2019Etude du Sport produced an analysis of the association of origin for expatriate players. It highlights that in England in the 2015/16 season, club-trained players represented only 10% of the total number of English players, the lowest level among the European Big 5 Leagues. Although English Football League Clubs play a major role in producing national players, Premier League Clubs are the highest recruiters of players and coaches from abroad amongst the Big 5 Leagues, with 46.8% of players recruited internationally and only 7 British Managers for the 20 Premier League Clubs. Also, English players and coaches are the least represented in the other European Leagues, highlighting a clear reluctance or inability of English players to attain First Team opportunities abroad. Within English Football Academies, the situation is inverted: amongst 320 scholars aged between 16 and 18 over 85% are British and amongst the U16s 2,486 students the proportion rises to around 95%.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nLSE and its partners see European mobility as an invaluable way to address two of the key areas identified by the England Commission to enhance the quality of English footballers and coaches. The project aims to tackle the lack of quality coaching by integrating the BTEC/NVQ developed at the Academy with innovative elements from the Bozsik Elite Programme (founded in Hungary) by sending the academies to GLOBALL Football Park and Sporthotel in Telki, Hungary. They will undertake daily training sessions and progress will be monitored through use of video analysis and daily diaries. It is expected that this will improve the skills of the apprentice players whilst broadening their employment opportunities, allowing them to become more competitive within the English market and/or being able to pursue a career abroad as a consequence of the mobility.\r\n\r\nBeing subject to new training methodologies in the host country, the aim is that the apprentices will benefit both from improved employment rates in acquiring professional playing contracts and enhance their employability in a secondary career, either in the UK or in Europe.
