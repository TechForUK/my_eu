One expected consequence of these on new tyres will be the slow decreasing of the interest on retreaded tyres in the market. This will compromise the future activity of SMEs working in the field, and also determine a fatal risk for the smallest enterprises.\nTherefore, it is of vital importance for the retreaded truck tyre sector (400 companies, of which 95% SMEs and 14 SME associations/groupings in Europe who allow 50% of European trucks to drive on retreaded tyres) to find a scientifically sound and cost effective methodology for classification of retreaded truck tyres in order to comply with future environmental performance and safety requirements.\nTo maintain the standard in a long-term prospective, and hopefully even increase the market for retreaded tyres, it is necessary to provide clear statistic and reproducible results on the retreads performances. Only in such a way it would be possible to compete with the new tyre market.\nThe concept is to investigate all relevant parameters related to casings, retreading process and treads applied and to determine the influence thereof on the tyre performance.

The overarching theme is the development and dissemination of a common pedagogy based on the rapidly changing developments and requirements for ICT including computer programming and robotics. In response to developing economic and social needs of countries across the EU, elements of computer science have entered primary school programmes of work. These new curricula aim to provide a high quality education in the burgeoning field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), empowering pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. Engagement with this new discipline ensures that pupils become digitally literate, i.e. able to use and express themselves and extend their ideas through ICT, to become competent for their future workplaces and as active participants in the digital world. Although in the near future, we can expect the first \u2018digitally native\u2019 teachers, the present situation is that there is a discernible gap in confidence and competence between current teachers and their pupils. This has created a challenge for the professional development of teachers and so the overarching aim of this project is to provide some resolution to issues of curriculum implementation in  the fields of information technology in general and robotics and programming more specifically. The project aims to support current teachers and influence the content of  initial teacher education, whilst at the same time making positive impact upon the developing interests and skills of pupils within the primary age range of 4 -11/12 years. These skills are based upon the \u20184Cs\u2019: Collaboration, Communication, Creativity and Critical thinking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide evidence for effective:\r\n\u2022 development of 20th Century teachers\u2019 professional knowledge for preparation and delivery of 21st Century skills in learning and ICT for pupils;\r\n\u2022 coverage of new elements of ICT curricular content in computer programming and robotics; \r\n\u2022 provision of  new subject and pedagogic knowledge to support the use of robotics and programming in the primary age range;\r\n\u2022 enhancement of programmes of study to produce age-relevant resources, schemes of work and skills progression;\r\n\u2022 exploration of  ways of combining and generating creativity with logic;\r\n\u2022 understanding from pupils\u2019 viewpoints of the purpose of learning these new skills;\r\n\u2022 development of both  independence and cooperative learning and teamwork: the 4Cs.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To develop and enhance primary school teachers\u2019 skills and understanding within the emerging field of robotics and programming.\r\n2. To enable primary school pupils to use and apply their acquired skills to become responsible, confident and creative users of ICT.\r\n3. To create appropriate pedagogy and detailed schemes of work, including continuity and progression for development of specific skills.\r\n4. To develop effective partnerships with the 'world of work' to contextualize the pedagogy/learning.\r\n5.

Whilst it encompasses elements of the current vogue for maths mastery, it is so much more than this.\r\nThis project aims at providing an innovative approach to the development of the teaching of mathematics that will enhance existing good practice in the area and essentially support teachers\u2019 skills confidence and competence to teach. \r\nOne of our primary aims therefore is to equip teachers to enable them to be 'experts', to discover, how this can be achieved and share the outcomes, and to ensure future generations of teachers are equipped and prepared to enter the profession with similar degrees of expertise and expectation.\r\nFurthermore, the project also very importantly places clear emphasis on the links to the real world and aims to embrace, instilll and facilitate 21st century skills for project participants across all groups: teachers, pupils\u2019, parents and others. We have chosen key intellectual outputs which we believe will allow us to systematically capture the broad scope of the project. We recognise that individuals experience of maths is not just affected by their teacher\u2019s competency, enthusiasm for example, as there are greater complexities to review, such as parental engagement and non-formal educational links.\r\n\r\nThe project allows us to look more broadly than this, as education cannot sit in isolation from the world it operates within. Our focus on influences and demands outside of the school setting will be vital to see how these can be influenced, engaged and understood. Through this, further opportunities and best practice can be identified and potential barriers to pupils and future adults can be removed.

The project aims to engage with business, parents and local communities as this is the real world that we all operate within. Understanding and developing authentic parental engagements is going to be a key part of the project and seeing increased involvement and dialogue with parents is crucial to this. We believe that they have much to share, inform and teach stakeholders about their experiences of maths in their real worlds.
