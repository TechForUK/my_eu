These upward trends are worrying, as malignant melanoma is one of the most difficult cancers to treat, due to its ability to spread quickly and its resistance to standard chemotherapeutic agents. In order to counteract this trend, targeted therapies that inhibit melanoma metastasis are required. The aim of SYS-MEL is to identify and validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for melanoma, and to model the predictive value of these biomarkers in determining the efficacy of melanoma therapies. The central objective is to bring together four European academic institutes and two SMEs to develop 3 prognostic/predictive biomarker assays for melanoma. 3 core areas of interest are epigenetics, signalling pathways in melanoma and systems biological approaches for predicting chemotherapy responses. SYS-MEL will have three main elements: 1) Epigenomic and protein expression analysis of melanoma tissue, to validate an epigenomic signature initially identified in the FP7-funded programme Target-Melanoma; 2) In silico modelling and prediction of patient responses to decarbazine DTIC using both in vitro analysis of apoptotic pathways and a novel systems biology approach, incorporating mathematical systems modelling, quantitative biochemistry and cell biology; 3) Investigating the components of the P-Rex1 pathway that are involved in driving the migration of melanoblast cells, and thus the progression of metastasis, incorporating a computational system tailored to model complex signalling pathways.

Loss of the APC protein leads to the activation of Wnt signaling target genes such as c-Myc which is required for phenotypes causes by Apc loss.\nHowever, despite the clear importance of APC loss and deregulated Wnt signalling, additional events are required for the development of CRC such as KRAS and P53 mutations.The impact of these changes on the development of CRC and response to therapy is not well understood.

This is achieved through interactions with other transcription factors such as MyoD, E47 and Ets. To date, all of the published targets of Id regulation are genes encoding protein. However we have discovered that Ids can also stimulate expression of short non-coding RNAs that are transcribed by RNA polymerase (pol) III, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. This regulation appears to be direct, as endogenous Id proteins can be crosslinked in vivo to pol III transcribed genes. We also detect E47, a protein that promotes differentiation of several cell types, at these genes and find that it represses pol III transcription. This is consistent with the established antagonism between Id proteins and E47. It is well documented that pol III transcripts are overexpressed in many tumours. Our data suggests that, direct activation by Id proteins may contribute to this. It may be important, because elevated tRNA expression was recently shown to have proliferative and oncogenic effects in cell culture and in mice.\nThis proposal aims to dissect molecular mechanisms responsible for Id mediated activation of tRNA and other pol III transcribed genes.

State of the art genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and imaging analyses will be used to identify the roles of p53 in the response to metabolic stress caused by nutrient deficiency or excess, and investigate how these activities balance cell survival and cell death. Models will be developed to address how these functions of p53 relate to the control of metabolism and disease in vivo.

We expect the introduction of new methods and working formats/organization in the classroom in different age groups, more project and interdisciplinary learning, connecting the school\u00b4s objectives with life, outdoor learning and learning in nature, and the introduction of the necessary reorganization of teaching, as well as an update of the implementation of the curriculum of the school.  We will strive even further, that by the example and demonstration of our good practices we expand our knowledge outwards, first to the teacher practitioners through the \u201cMarket of knowledge\u201d, workshops, teacher trainings, and thus, we also indirectly influence on policy makers.", "http://www.bearsdenacademy.e-dunbarton.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SI01-KA101-012452_1"], ["2SY", "Introducing the Teaching of Spanish at Bearsden Primary School P5-7", "Bearsden Primary School", 2028.0, "Currently Bearsden Primary School teaches one Modern Language: French. As a school we aim to train a member of staff to lead and support staff and pupils in the teaching of Spanish as a second language to allow us to meet the requirements of The Scottish Governments policy of 1 +2 due to be implemented by 2020. This will allow us to begin to successfully teach and deliver Spanish in Bearsden Primary School from Primary 5 to Primary 7 and give children a better experience of Modern Languages in the school. We aim to better engage the children in our school in the learning of Spanish. To this we plan to send a staff member to  Full Immersion Spanish Course provided by LFEE. By attending the course the participant will improve their confidence and ability to communicate with others in Spanish, which in turn will improve the ability to teach the Spanish language in the primary setting in Bearsden Primary School. By completing the LFEE course in Malaga a certificate of attendance will be awarded to the candidate. This certificate is recognised by the General Teaching Council of Scotland and leads towards full accreditation of teaching Spanish. Attending the training in Spain will improve teaching ideas, help gain better knowledge of the Spanish language and culture and then allow a staff member to lead teachers and pupils in the Spanish language within Bearsden Primary School. Any resources gained from the course will be able to be shared with the school community to encourage all staff to use the language. \r\n\r\nThe training course would allow a member of Bearsden Primary School's staff to attend a one week course run by LFEE which would compliment the learning of Spanish that the staff member has already undertaken through Strathclyde University. The aim is to have more teachers trained in delivering Spanish in the primary school, which would create more engaging lessons encouraging more children to enjoy learning a foreign language. This in turn will aim to help support Bearsden Academy's Modern Language department as more children will have a positive experience of learning Spanish. \r\n\r\nAs a result of attending the course we believe our participant will be able to lead whole school and staff CPD. We aim to introduce children to eTwinning and to create links with Spanish schools allowing real life need to understand and use a foreign language. Having links to Spanish skills will help to improve the motivation for children to learn the language. \r\n\r\nIt will improve cultural awareness and this will be shared and taught to pupils. The participant will aim to inform other schools within the local area about the course, both promoting LFEE and Spanish learning, and as part of this will host a Spanish day in the school for staff and learners. Local councilors and members of the public will be able to attend part of this day to inspire and show the wider community exactly what the school are doing to promote language learning within the town of Bearsden.\r\n\r\nIf the number of teachers who can teach Spanish increases, we will be able to meet the First Minister's challenge of teaching 2 languages in schools by 2020.\r\n\r\nThe impact of attending this course will in turn allow a participant to improve their Spanish skills, will allow the participant to deliver whole staff CPD to sharing and resourcing others with Spanish teaching ideas and lessons. It will promote language learning in Bearsden Primary School, the local community and will encourage all learners to achieve excellence within the context of Spanish learning.", "https://blogs.glowscotland.org.uk/ed/bearsdenprimary/", "Bearsden Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046859_coordinator"], ["3AX", "Language training", "Bearsden Academy", 3891.0, "Since she started to learn Spanish in High School, Nadia has always expressed a strong interest for the language and culture of Spanish countries. By undertaking the Certificate in continuing education Spanish course at the University of Strathclyde, Nadia expressed the wish to be fully registered as a Spanish teacher and to complete an intensive course - it has been identified as part of her Personal Review and Development. She delivered lessons in Spanish and helped the department delivering lessons to S2-S3 pupils but had so far had limited opportunity to teach Spanish notably regards the senior phase. This immersion course will enable her to refresh and update her grammar and linguistic skills as well as to develop new methodology of teaching and learning of a foreign language. Nadia sustains effective professional relationships within the department by sharing classes with different teachers and sharing good practise with all her colleagues within the department and also from other subjects. Developing linguistic and teaching skills in Spanish can then be shared with the rest of the Modern Languages department, at whole school level, with parents at parents' information evening and the associated Primary schools.  Nadia is also responsible for the languages lunch club offered to pupils on a weekly basis, this immersion course will enable her to increase her awareness of the Spanish culture and to share it with pupils. It will also help her developing  knowledge of ICT tools and ressources suitable for the learning and teaching of Spanish in her class.\r\nAt Bearsden Academy, we strongly wish that Spanish can be established as a realistic option for pupils from S1 onwards, as French is being the only language offered in S1 at the moment.  The course will complement the school\u2019s strategy for the 1+2 in accordance with the Scottish Government\u2019s policy and will also help to develop a sense of International Global Citizenship within Bearsden Learning Community.  Language learning being life enhancing, the immersion course in Malaga will give Nadia the tools to help her pupils to open the doors to possibilities and experiences which are not available to those who are restricted to the knowledge of one language. The school will be able to raise the profile of languages and increase the intercultural awareness by strengthening links with fellow European colleagues and initiating international activities with partner schools. As a direct result of the course the pupils will have increased choice in the languages being offered at Bearsden Academy from S1 and will also benefit from new teaching methods and resources, which will be incorporated into teaching and learning within the classroom. It will also enable Bearsden Academy to organise and offer a trip to Spain in the near future.\r\nOverall, the impact of this training will be hugely significant, both to Nadia and the entire Bearsden Learning Community. Indeed, Nadia\u2019s participation in the LFEE 3 week immersion course is crucial in her process to become GTCS fully registered in Spanish and will help her deliver Spanish to pupils across the school. It will provide her with new and innovative teaching methodologies; help to improve her fluency in the use of the language and to increase her cultural awareness, which will be used in and out of the classroom. \r\nOur vision at Bearsden Academy, is to make French and Spanish accessible to all pupils within our school and our cluster primary schools. In terms of the impact in Bearsden Academy, the immersion course will allow our Modern Languages department to work together on creating and developing courses and sharing good practice to introduce Spanish within a Broad General Education. With regards the Senior Phase, attending the immersion course will afford Nadia the opportunity to be registered and to teach SQA certificated courses. With Spanish introduced into the school, the profile of the languages department will be raised and pupils' cultural awareness increased. Most importantly, Nadia's attendance on the course will allow pupils in Bearsden Academy to have personalisation and choice in terms of their own language learning. It will allow pupils to use their transferable language skills and develop a deeper and more profound understanding of both English and Modern Foreign Languages. Furthermore, once Spanish is launched in Bearsden Academy and our cluster primaries, we would look to initiating links through eTwinning with a Spanish-speaking school.", "http://www.bearsdenacademy.e-dunbarton.sch.uk", "Bearsden Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047250_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 9025.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_3771", 2016], ["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 2585.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_10300", 2016], ["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 1157.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_29052", 2016], ["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 6872.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_6158", 2017], ["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 398.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_27663", 2017], ["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 6132.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_29323", 2017], ["2RG", "DNA LANGUAGE LTD*", 417.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_55329", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "G61"}
