This theme is predicated on the notions, firstly, that an awareness of issues relating to sustainability, conservation, ecology, global warming and renewable resources should be developed at an early age and secondly that such an awareness produces practical implications and outcomes for the wider school community. Pupils will be able to discuss the issues at the appropriate level and offer possible action plans for dealing with these, eventually in a comparative international context.The three years of the project are divided into six periods termed Semesters of approximately equal length. This allows for differences in dates of academic terms across Europe.Throughout the Partnership, led by the Science Education Department at MAK\u00dc, threads will be followed which develop the Partnership's teaching ethos of encouraging pupils to develop logical coherent thinking and becoming articulate in expressing their own ideas whilst responding to the ideas of others. Within these threads pupils will engage in activities relating to the understanding of the issues and the addressing of questions of ultimate concern. Pupils will learn about the societal backgrounds of Partners and develop an appreciation that small changes at any level can have large consequences. They will undertake a range of activities at an appropriate level including conducting local research to include surveying both relevant school and local initiatives. Included in the plans are activities aimed at energy conservation;  national and international research aimed at producing comparative studies of relevant cross national initiatives; the study of renewable resources; plans for the future and activities intended to disseminate results to wide audiences including the production of an Erasmus Festival and conservation guides for wider school community consumption.Partnership plans include an emphasis on the introduction of appropriately levelled scientific concepts at as early an age as possible. The intention is to create a practical ecological curriculum which will have consequences for the wider communities.  The aim is to produce an innovatory approach and curriculum which can be adopted or adapted by primary schools wherever located. In order to achieve the goals the Partnership will support schools in developing to maximum capability their utilization of ICT applications, whilst supporting one another in areas where there is an inequitable distribution of resources. Students at MAK\u00dc will experience a range of hands on educational research.The programmes of work which are cognizant of the needs and aspirations of  pupils with special needs  or disabilities (SEND) who are vulnerable and for those who are gifted and talented in specific areas. Pupils in all Partner Institutions will contribute to planning and assessment.Semesters begin with a Planning & Review Meeting. These are the administrative driving force. As well as making administrative decisions they create Semester Action Plans and rigorously review the work of the previous Semester. Hosting rotates between Partner Institutions. In the final Semester the product of the Partnership will be drawn together and all communities involved will participate in a Europe-wide simultaneous Erasmus Festival.In terms of ethos, self-view and commitment to one another Partners will develop close and purposeful contacts which leave a legacy for the schools, the University and enhance future life choices for pupils. Partners wish to develop and enhance pupils' and students' views of themselves as contributing European citizens and to enable them to share their lives, languages, educational establishments and communities via a range of mediums in an enjoyable, productive and meaningful manner, whilst collaborating and sharing experiences with their peers in other countries.For staffs the aim is to promote good teaching practice within schools and the University and to disseminate this practice to a wide audience. Opportunities for staff mobilities will be maximized in order to enhance the relationships between staffs and develop the wider European perspective in their operational curricular.  One of the clear aims is to produce a practical view of a pedagogy for the teaching of ecology and related subject matter from a cross-cultural perspective with educational practice which is sustainable in the future. Mobilities both as part of cyclical review and for training will be directed towards this practical pedagogy.The Partnership will continually disseminate widely to all interested parties in various forums and via modern communication technology, the planning, progression and outcomes of the Partnership.The plans meet the criteria of substantial sections of the Key Action 2 expectations and the Strategic Partnership Horizontal and Field-Specific priorities.", "http://www.birchencoppiceprimary.co.uk", "Birchen Coppice Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024522_coordinator"]]}}}}
