This project seeks to move on from this and effect systemic change and have a greater impact on the philosophy and pedagogical of not only the partner schools but also to help support wider change in achieving its aims: \r\n\r\nThe use of IT to encourage motivation and engagement is often talked about, this project will put in place practical examples of how this can be delivered and include philosophical foundation practical outcomes, and a change of teaching approaches and attitudes.  We expect the outcomes to affect not only our immediate community but have a much wider effect on other groups though the multiplier events and intellectual outputs. \r\n\r\nFlipped learning is an area that is beginning to grow in a very small minority of schools, in order for us to continue in our journeys to become even better and this requires a shift in what we do to enable us to get better results for  our students and teachers. We believe that the flipped learning experience will begin with a significant change to the practice of individual teachers which will in turn provide us with more independent, confident, reflective, and focused students and in turn this will be identified through the impact on students achievement. \r\n\r\nWe expect there to be a cascade of change in teaching practice that will eventually shift the practice of schools, the changes will be made as teachers take part in the transnational meetings and receive high level training and work collaboratively with partner school staff to make significant changes in practice. \r\n\r\nThere will be an extensive support system for all staff involved in the project to help them through their change in teaching practice and methodology. Teachers and students will be trained to use the IT tools to support their teaching and learning, this will provide them with lifelong learning skills and tools that can be used in further education and in the future in the workplace.\r\n\r\n The new teaching methods for school staff will have a long term impact on their teaching style regardless of what school they teach in, these skills are transferable to different age ranges and different schools. Because of the documentation that will be produced as part of the project , new staff starting partner schools during the project term will have materials for and guidance for high quality training to enable them to join in with the project mid term and still have an impact on their teaching methodology and their students achievement.  \r\n\r\nThe desired impact at different levels will encompass the following points\r\n*increased quality of education in Europe and beyond: combining higher levels of excellence and attractiveness with increased opportunities for all, including those at disadvantage\r\n*improved provision and assessment of basic and transversal skills, particularly digital skills\r\n*more strategic and integrated use of ICTs and open educational resources (OER) by education\r\n*increased motivation for language learning through innovative teaching methods or better links to practical use of language skills  required by the labour market reinforced interaction between practice, research and policy in each systems\r\n\r\nWe have a vision that this project would bring the focus of a currently small group of flipped learning enthusiasts toward this transnational cooperative project to draw the attentionof a very wide world audience that would continue for many years.", null, "Jervoise School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013669_coordinator"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["6JA", "RYW", "West Midlands Rehabilitation Centre"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B29"}
