Also a comparative study of preschool activities shows that young children get involved in activities like constructing games, playing with toys, reading books, playing in the sandpit, using playground equipment, language, communication, art/creativity, health and physics whereas themes such as ethical and social issues seem to be neglected.This project is developed by UK, IT, LT, EE, TR with the aim of introducing moral values and ethics into pre-school education. The theme is decided by negotiation of all partners during preparation process. The tasks have been equally shared between all the partners. The project intends to increase the quality of kindergarten education and care services and it also aims to make it more accessible. Several preschool curricula will be analyzed and we will also make a theoretical study of ethical issues that should be forwarded to preschool children.
