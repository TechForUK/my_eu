At the same time, multi-core and many-core computing platforms are becoming available on the market and provide a breakthrough for system (and application) integration.\n\nA major industrial challenge arises facing (cost) efficient integration of different applications with different levels of safety and security on a single computing platform in an open context.\n\nThe objective of the EMC\u00b2 project (Embedded multi-core systems for mixed criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments) is to foster these changes through an innovative and sustainable service-oriented architecture approach for mixed criticality applications in dynamic and changeable real-time environments.\n\nThe EMC2 project focuses on the industrialization of European research outcomes and builds on the results of previous ARTEMIS, European and National projects.

This issue was identified to have high impact on European innovation productivity by the Report of the Independent Expert Group on R&D and Innovation, commonly known as the Aho-report. The report demanded incentives for the convergence of shared technologies and markets as a remedy. Actions creating standardized, commercially exploitable yet widely accessible ecosystems in European priority areas should be publicly supported. Real-time applications for heterogeneous, networked, embedded many-core systems suffer from the lack of trusted pathways to system realization and application deployment. Service and product development efforts are high with many uncertainties discouraging such ventures. This project brings to bear a holistically designed ecosystem from application to silicon. The ecosystem is realized as a tightly integrated multi-vendor solution and tool chain complementing existing standards. Feature-limited releases of reference tools and platforms are made available under favourable licensing conditions to support the evaluation and adoption of the results. Full-fledged versions are retained for commercial exploitation and standardization of the overall ecosystem is pursued. As direct effects of the project results 30% reduction of the total cost of ownership, 50% shorter time-to-market, and 30% decrease of the number of development assets are expected. Marketable lead applications driving ecosystem development and benchmarking on the fields of industrial & intelligent transport systems, video & image processing, and wireless communications are produced.

The increased numbers of cores is commonly regarded as a design challenge in the safety-critical area, as there are no established approaches to achieve certification.\nAt the same time there is an increased need for flexibility in the products in the safety-critical market. This need for flexibility puts new requirements on the customization and the upgradability of both the non-safety and safety-critical critical part. The difficulty with this is the large cost in both effort and money of the re-certification of the modified software, which means that companies cannot fully leverage the advantages of modular software system.\nRECOMP will provide reference designs and platform architectures together with the required design methods and tools for achieving cost-effective certification and re-certification of mixed-criticality, component based, multi-core systems.

This challenge brings the opportunity to integrate multiple applications onto the same hardware platform bringing significant advantages in performance, production costs, and reliability. It also brings a severe threat relating to a key problem of CRTES; the need to prove that all temporal constraints will be satisfied during operation. Current CRTES, based on relatively simple singlecore processors, are already extremely difficult to analyse for temporal behaviour, resulting in errors in operation costing EU industry billions each year. The advent of multicore and manycore platforms exacerbates this problem, rendering traditional temporal analysis techniques ineffectual. A new approach is needed.The PROXIMA thesis is that the temporal behaviour of mixed-criticality CRTES executing on multicore and manycore platforms can be analysed effectively via innovative probabilistic techniques. PROXIMA defines new hardware and software architectural paradigms based on the concept of randomisation. It extends this approach across the hardware and software stack ensuring that the risks of temporal pathological cases are reduced to quantifiably small levels. On top of this, PROXIMA builds a comprehensive suite of probabilistic analysis methods integrated into commercial design, development, and verification tools, complemented by appropriate arguments for certification.
