Collaborating with the teacher from Rodrigues and job shadowing with our partner school in Gloucester would enable us to see and understand how English is learned from an early stage and then developed into more progressive ability.\r\nThe two French teachers implied in the project, Mrs Fuentes and Mrs Mayoux, actually contemplate taking part together in the job shadowing in Gloucester, on the last week before the half-term holidays in October and first week of the holidays in the school year 2014-2015.\r\n\r\nFollowing the job shadowing experience, new teaching practices can be used to broaden our own approach of language teaching in secondary school and will enable to help students facing difficulties in developing their skills in English.\r\n\r\nThe partnership between the  Rodrigues nursery school and students from the upper sixth form taking part into activities in English to young learners has been going on for two years now. By doing so, our high school students feel valued and recognized in their skills and abilities, which is a key factor in gaining motivation in their studies and is highly important in their development as individuals with better self-esteem and self-confidence.\r\n\r\nWorking with a partner school in the United Kingdom will also enable our students, whether they take part to the pre-school activities or not, to get aware of the European dimension by realizing how much cultural background all European pupils and students have in common by sharing the same songs and nursery rhymes and kid stories.", "http://www.hillviewprimary.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA101-000910_1"], ["3LH", "Tourner le regard de la maternelle ,jumelage/observation dans une \u00e9cole partenaire", "Hillview Primary School", 1621.0, "Rodrigues nursery school recieves essentially children from North Africa : we intend to give to these children traditionnaly focusing on South, a look on european area ; we would like to stress on their  bilingual skills to improve their language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- The project is set up on two directions :\r\n\r\n                       - a partnership with the Lyc\u00e9e de Baudre, conducted by two teachers.

We also expected that they will have more confidence to experiment with different tools and approaches to developing competencies for employability of young people they are working with. By improving our participants' competencies, we are improving their future practice and thus impacting positively on the work of their organisations. Partners of this project are implementing number of youth work activities, and we expect that their project quality will be improved by using new tools that will acknowledge efforts of youth work in increasing employability of young people, which will give them new confidence in working with youngsters. In turn, we believe that these new approaches will attract more young people to partner organisations. N addition, partner organisations will use new possibilities offered by Erasmus+ programme. Finally, it is expected that young people, beneficiaries of partner organisations, should benefit from increased employability. They will have new tools that would help them recognise and develop their competences and link them to their employability and advantage on the labour market. \r\nWe expect that the long term benefits of this project will be giving confidence to youth workers to help young people increase their employability through youth work, as well as more innovative and creative tools for facilitating learning and increasing competencies of young people available in European youth field.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-CY02-KA105-000446_8"], ["2AN", "THE IDENTITY MAKERS - Building European identity together", "Gloucestershire Mentoring and Support CiC", 9981.0, "The project \"THE IDENTITY MAKERS\" involves the british organization GMAS (Gloucestershire Mentoring and Support), based in the rural region of Gloucestershire, and the Municipality of Tortona - Youth Policies Office and Youth Centre.

This first youth exchange will be the background of the youth exchange hosted in Tortona. \r\n\r\nThe project \"THE IDENTITY MAKERS\" is born from the meeting of the two organizations and from the common need of giving young people a new perspective, more intercultural and more european, and to lead them through a structured and shared path towards a greater awareness of their identities, their cultures and their role in Europe, sensitizing them on the topics of intercultural learning, tolerance and acceptance and knowledge of different cultures and realities. Starting from the analysis of their own cultures and asking themselves some key questions, participants will be able to address and learn the basic issues and values of the European Union: \"What makes us europeans? What does it mean the union of the european peoples? until which point are we italians/english and where do we start to be europeans? how much european our lives are? which visions do we have for the future of Europe? how can different cultures find common solutions and think in the interest of a common benefit?\"each theme will be introduced by  # to connect the project to the reality of young active European.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach these objectives, we will use non forma education methodologies and participatory approaches where decisions will be taken together and in which young people will be equally responsible for the success of the project.

We will then set up four multi-national \"businesses\", splitting the young people form different nations into joint teams.  From here we will run through daily tasks in a variety of methods.  We will explore marketing through a video and graphic design work shop; we will think about product/service design by visiting a successful local and pan-European business to see their product deisgn in action; we will explore ethics in business by visiting a business for adults with learning difficulties and also thinking about the local, unethical history of the slave trade and its heritage at Gloucester Docks.  We will do outdoor games in our leisure time to encourage informal sharing of culture and language.

The project will be particularly aimed at young people who face barriers to involvement in international work including young carers, young people who have educational difficulties, and young people with complex social circumstances that may stop them accessing positive activities.2016 is an Olympic Year and also European Football Championship year.  Interest in sport will be at a local, national and European peak.  We intend to harness this interest to work with young people to explore questions of identity and culture in a week long cooperation based on sporting activities.  Using YouthPass accreditation to certificate learning we will use informal methods, sport and play to explore big questions that young people face: where do I fit in in my community?  How does my country relate to others in Europe?  How is my sense of self defined?  The week is focusing on two outcomes - to improve young peoples' skills and employability through the development of language, cooperation and communication; and to increase participation for young people who face barriers to accessing such a project.
