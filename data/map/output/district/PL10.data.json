Since  the Call 2005 the programme has  been continued  by  the newly founded  ROC van Twente   under the supervision of its International  Office (IO). \r\n\r\nThe International Mobility flows in  IVT and Vetpro  grew: uniformity in process and regulations - improved quality - led  to an  increased impact within the institution. Result: continuously  growing numbers of participating ROC-departments and participants  - IVT as well as Vetpro - in successive Calls 2005, 2006 , 2007,2008, 2009 and 2010. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime a number of basic improvements was implemented :\r\n\r\n- improvement of ROC internal procedures:  in 2008  the project administration was  incorporated in the  ROC project office ( back- and front office)\r\n\r\n- a internal network of  coordinators internationalization ( on MBO College and team level) has been installed\r\n\r\n- supporting procedures and tools were developed and implemented on ROC level:  ROC van Twente Guideline for International Mobility, Digital Application Form, Insurance Brochure etc.\r\n\r\n- a large international network of reliable exchange partners in (almost) all European countries \r\n\r\nwas developed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall a strong organization, capable of implementing international mobility projects,  was created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 2011\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2011 board and managementeam ROC van Twente launched a new strategy document  on  Internationalization in 4 perspectives: Student, Employee, MBO College and ROC van Twente.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to  student- and staff mobility  new policies and objectives were defined, \r\n\r\n to be  implemented in future mobility calls:  2011, 2012, 2013 and  current Erasmus Plus Call 2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Mobility \r\n\r\n Policy:\r\n\r\nCompetence-based learning is in the heart of  our VET. We offer an inspiring learning environment in which students  can  develop professional as well as social competences. Through an international workplacement abroad, participation in study tours, exchanges and international projects  students get the opportunity to improve  their professional, communication  and intercultural skills in an international setting.  \r\n\r\nObjective:  strenghtening the employability by  developing international competences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff Mobility \r\n\r\nPolicy:\r\n\r\nparticipation in international mobility and activities reinforces the professional, didactic and pedagogical skills of staff. By participating in international activities (study visits, language trainings or workplacements abroad)  teachers will be able to share and enrich their professional expertise and to reflect on their own educational and teaching concepts from  different perspectives. It will motivate and revitalize them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Objectives:   - professionalizing  staff and improving  the quality of VET\r\n\r\n                          - creating  awareness of the international dimension in VET /labour market  developments\r\n\r\n                         -  orientation in the international branch-specific VET- field\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince then management and staff of ROC van Twente  work-  with renewed enthusiasm - on the realization of the strategy and the objectives. In the implementation of the Mobility  IVT and Vetpro Call 2013  this has now led to an explosion of student and teacher mobility. Mid-term (June 2014) the available  budgets allocated for the Call 2013 IVT and VETPRO are already deployed. \r\n\r\nWith the help of  this Erasmus Plus Mobility Application Eurolinks  X ROC van Twente  emphatically wants again to stimulate this growth and expansion: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nobjectives  per activity / target group in numbers of participants \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity 1:   Staff training abroad                                               10\r\n\r\nActivity 2:   Training/teaching assignments abroad            40\r\n\r\nActivity 3:   VET learners in companies                                   150\r\n\r\nActivity 4:   VET learners in vocational institutes                   30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal: student mobilities  180 per year, Staff mobilities  50 per 2 year. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past 10 years a broad international network  of education and business  partners has been established.

We want to include candidates with disadvantage (personal and/or socioeconomic). \r\nThe main objective is to offer our VET staff and learners a valuable and unique new opportunity, through a high-quality training and learning experience in another country.  We will accomplish this over the duration of the project by sending: 8 staff members and 16 VET learners to gain new skills and training in 4  VET organizations across Europe. \r\n\r\nVET staff  sometimes find that it is difficult to encourage learners  into training and into the workplace and our staff will learn new methods, approaches and tools that are used across Europe to increase the up take of VET courses. They will be able to establish what approaches our European partners use to incentive and motivate people to undertake VET courses. Through the job shadowing and training activities within the project our staff will be able to learn new skills, methods, techniques and approaches and cascade this learning through our organisation and consequently the impact and results will be used within the work they do with disadvantaged groups within our community. \r\n\r\nWe operate from an isolated, rural and socio-economically deprived region.

They will also obtain an insight in other cultures, mentalities and enterprises. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of a network of European intermediaries, receiving enterprises, sending partners of regional companies and vocational education schools (e.g.: secondary schools and colleges) such as the HLW Reutte, HLW Lienz, Zillertaler Tourismusschulen, Villa Blanka, HLW Landeck and Tyrolean companies for example: Swarovski Optik KG or TH\u00d6NI Industriebetriebe GmbH.\r\n\r\nThe planned project (scheduled for 24 months and starting in June 2015) is a long-term strategy in order to offer ongoing EU-granted placements to young Tyroleans. The demand on the part of students in vocational education is increasing, also the number of apprentices taking part. The project is managed and coordinated by the Local Agency Tyrol and it\u00b4s experienced staff, in close with the sending institutions as well as with the regional Chamber of Labour and the Tyrolean Government. The special character of the project is the use of expertise of previous projects and established links with social and regional partners.\r\nThe projects\u00b4 information and awareness activities will continue all over the project period, in form of e.g.: press releases, facebook www.facebook.at/bewegdeinleben, entries in (partner) websites etc.", "http://www.pointeuropa.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-AT01-KA102-004781_19"], ["1AS", "Eurolinks XI", "Point Europa", 241170.0, "Period: 2004 - 2010\r\n\r\nThe Eurolinks programme-  covering Leonardo Mobility Exchange and  Placements  - started in 2004. Since  the Call 2005 the programme has  been continued  by  the newly founded  ROC van Twente   under the supervision of its International  Office (IO). \r\nThe International Mobility flows in  IVT and Vetpro  grew: uniformity in process and regulations - improved quality - led  to an  increased impact within the institution. Result: continuously  growing numbers of participating ROC-departments and participants  - IVT as well as Vetpro - in successive Calls 2005, 2006 , 2007,2008, 2009 and 2010. \r\nIn the meantime a number of basic improvements was implemented :\r\n- improvement of ROC internal procedures:  in 2008  the project administration was  incorporated in the  ROC Project office ( back- and front office)\r\n- an internal network of  coordinators internationalization ( on MBO College and team level) has been installed\r\n- supporting procedures and tools were developed and implemented on ROC level:  ROC van Twente Guideline for International Mobility, Digital Application Form, Insurance Brochure etc.\r\n- a large international network of reliable exchange partners in (almost) all European countries was developed\r\n\r\nOverall a strong organization, capable of implementing international mobility projects,  was created.\r\n\r\n2011-2014 \r\n\r\nIn 2011 board and managementeam ROC van Twente launched a new strategy document  on  Internationalization in 4 perspectives: Student, Employee, MBO College and ROC van Twente.\r\n\r\nWith regard to  student- and staff mobility  new policies and objectives were defined,  to be  implemented in future mobility calls:  2011, 2012, 2013 and  current Erasmus Plus Call 2014.\r\n\r\nStudent Mobility: objective:  strenghtening the employability by  developing international competences.\r\n policy:\r\nCompetence-based learning is in the heart of  our VET. We offer an inspiring learning environment in which students  can  develop professional as well as social competences. Through an international workplacement abroad, participation in study tours, exchanges and international projects  students get the opportunity to improve  their professional, communication  and intercultural skills in an international setting.  \r\n\r\nStaff Mobility \r\nObjectives:   - professionalizing  staff and improving  the quality of VET\r\n                          - creating  awareness of the international dimension in VET /labour market  developments\r\n                         -  orientation in the international branch-specific VET- field\r\n\r\nPolicy:\r\nparticipation in international mobility and activities reinforces the professional, didactic and pedagogical skills of staff. By participating in international activities (study visits, language trainings or workplacements abroad)  teachers will be able to share and enrich their professional expertise and to reflect on their own educational and teaching concepts from  different perspectives. It will motivate and revitalize them. \r\n \r\nSince then management and staff of ROC van Twente  work-  with renewed enthusiasm - on the realization of the strategy and the objectives. In the implementation of the Mobility  IVT and Vetpro Call 2013  this has led to an explosion of student and teacher mobility. Mid-term (June 2014) the available  budgets allocated for the Call 2013 IVT and VETPRO were  already deployed. \r\n\r\nResults  over the years :  best performances in successive Mobility Calls as well as excellent scores in midterm- and final reports.\r\n\r\n2015 \u2013 2017 \r\nIn line with this structural development, the new international challenges (the  new internationalization agenda -Ministery of Education , the new ambitions in Quality - and Excellence Plan ROC van Twente - theme International Mobility) will be elaborated by redesigning curricula and implementing  new programs ( free elective modules ) on internationalization on all levels . This will give international mobilty an extra boost.\r\n\r\nWith the help of  this Erasmus Plus Mobility Application Eurolinks  XI ROC van Twente  forcefully wants to stimulate this growth and expansion for the period 2015 \u2013 2017:\r\n\r\nobjectives  per activity / target group in numbers of participants \r\nActivity 1:   Staff training abroad                                                   44\r\nActivity 2:   Training/teaching assignments abroad               10\r\nActivity 3:   VET learners in companies                                     199\r\nActivity 4:   VET learners in vocational institutes                     25\r\n\r\nTotal: student mobilities  224 per year, Staff mobilities  54 per 2 year. \r\n\r\nROC van Twente is ready for it: in terms of policy development,  the embedding of policy and structure in the organization, the available expertise and experience.", "http://www.pointeuropa.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA102-008650_3"], ["1AS", "Interactions franco-europ\u00e9ennes: des pratiques professionnelles partag\u00e9es", "Point Europa", 43700.0, "Our proposition is part of a multiple objective strategy : it intends to sustain tested partnerships inducing a positioning related to a quality approach \u2013 in terms of collaborative work on the design and implementation of the project \u2013 as well as it aims for a programme development intended to diversify beneficiaries and increase their number, favoured by cooperation with new partners.\r\n\r\nIn the course of Commerce students' Baccalaur\u00e9at Professionnel training  - secondary education vocational qualification \u2013 the Lyc\u00e9e Jean Capelle, in Bergerac,  intended to offer them the opportunity to  carry out a work experience in another European country. On the occasion of a contact seminary  - Bordeaux, France, November 2008 - we got to meet representatives from equivalent institutions to ours, in terms of structure and training courses, among which the Vocational and Technical State school in Kartuzy, Poland.\r\n\r\nWe,  then, agreed on a partnership mode which materialized - within the framework of Leonardo Da Vinci Mobility, then Erasmus+ programmes - by trainee exchanges, placed in retail businesses, in Bergerac, then in Kartuzy, four times, between 2010 and 2014. On the same terms, twelve Polish students will, once again,  carry out an internship, in France, in September 2015.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, we have also undertaken a partnership with the Italian catering school IPSSAR Artusi, based in Riolo Terme, near Faenza, Emilia-Romagna. That collaboration \u2013 developed within the framework of Aquitaine Regional Council calls for international mobility projects \u2013 is part of the particular context of a twinning partnership between the two towns and has allowed uninterrupted trainee exchanges \u2013 cooks and waiters \u2013 placed in local restaurants. Eight French students will take advantage out of a similar mobility experience, in March 2015. Placing us in a quality approach, we would like to include that cooperation into our Erasmus+ project, in the prospect of improving implementation and sustainability conditions.\r\n\r\nThanks to those experiences and aware of what is really at stake, for beneficiaries, in terms of professional increase in value and education to European citizenship, we intend to offer mobility experiences to students from every vocational training speciality taught in our school. For that purpose, we have initiated cooperation with two new partners : a British non-profit organisation and a Spanish school, who have assured us of their ability to materialize placement options, for the benefit of our Healthcare and Administration students.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the next step of our project would consist in providing a mobility experience to eight Commerce students, in Poland, and five Administration students, in Spain, in November 2015, for a four week internship. Then, our approach would lead to send eight Catering students to Italy, and five Healthcare students to Great-Britain, in March 2016, for a five week work experience.\r\n\r\nOur recent experiences and intense and ongoing collaborative work with our European conterparts allow us to guarantee the participants the best conditions for realising professional objectives, specified by academic curriculum, inherent in student training. Besides purely practical and technical aspects - in terms of work placement approach -  we also wish to favour the discovery of a different culture, a different lifestyle and a different language, in a spirit of sharing. We intend to value the use of language skills in a professional context as well as in socializing situations, too.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration we intend to intensify with our European partners is part and parcel of that context. As a matter of fact, we wish to capitalize on experience debreifing in order to define common strategies and work tools from which institutions, as well as participants, might take advantage, in a spirit of continuity including a clearly upgradable nature of the exchange, in keeping with lifelong learning prospects.\r\n\r\n Our application puts us  in a  position to confirm the decidedly Europe oriented nature of our educational project by intensifying Lyc\u00e9e Jean Capelle's International Action work group activites, which is dedicated to conception, undertaking and advertising of mobility programmes, as well as finalization of transnational related projects, the aim of which is to generate interaction between partners and to involve students who would not get a chance to take part in a mobility experience.", "http://www.pointeuropa.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-013651_4"], ["1AS", "Edumob - Education et mobilit\u00e9 en Europe", "Point Europa", 26475.0, "Edumob is a project of educational mobility to adult advisors and facilitators of mobility in organizations working with young adults (Pistes-Solidaires, IJ network, EDIC and Mission Locale) of Aquitaine and particularly Southern Aquitaine.\r\nThe objective is to strengthen and develop new skills for mobility operators and information / guidance and support for young people.

Participants will be immersed in the reality of the work of these partners to discover and test the practices and activities of these organizations.\r\n\r\nThe aims are at different levels:\r\n- Appropriation of new working methods\r\n- Training to new tools\r\n- Awareness of the impact of mobility on a territory\r\n- Better assessment of impacts of mobility on organization and youth\r\n- Integration of new integration possibilities of mobility in the field of each\r\n- Developing skills strengthened in the reception, information guidance and monitoring of young adults.\r\nAdult education providers sometimes find that it is difficult to encourage adults back into training and into the workplace and our staff will learn new methods, approaches and tools that are used across Europe to increase the up take of adult education and training. They will be able to establish what approaches our European partners use to incentive and motivate people to undertake adult education training. Through the job shadowing and training activities within the project, our staff will be able to learn new skills, methods, techniques and approaches and cascade this learning through our organisation and consequently the impact and results will be used within the work they do with groups (young and adults) within our community. \r\n\r\nEdumob has been developed to involve three activity flows per host partner.  We have developed this approach to ensure that the optimum results and benefits are achieved within the mobility time frame.\r\n\r\n- The first flow will involve two key members of staff who will travel to the partner organisation and will be fully immersed into the day to day activities of the host organisation and will be identifying new and innovative methodological and tools used. \r\n\r\nThese 2 members of staff will return to Pistes-Solidaires following their mobility and will cascade their learning and knowledge to staff and community members.

The training approaches and methods that they use are in some ways innovative and utilize techniques in the following areas; theatre, outdoor education activities (Forest School activities, Sports), Gardening, entrepreneurship, education for sustainable development and social inclusion. Our staff will be involved in the trainer activities within these areas. They will be able to learn new skills and develop existing skills from their European counterparts and will be empowered to utilise these tools and methods within their own work and community activities in France.\r\n\r\nThe impacts of the project are twofold; firstly staff will develop their professional and personal competences and secondly they will gain knowledge that they will use in their own work in France. They will achieve this by; examination and observation of the strategic approaches adopted by our partner organizations in providing skills and training for adult learners; identifying current examples of successful best practice in relation to promoting adult learning in community contexts; investigating these contexts, including partnership aspects, in order to develop understanding of how Pistes-Solidaires may best plan for adult learners through an analysis of the attributes of successful practice and identification of inhibiting factors; examining the cultural, ideological and attitudinal factors which shape the responses of adults to further training and up-skilling in order to gain employment; assessing the resource implications of planning for adult learners; providing recommendations for policy and practice in adult education.\r\n\r\nThrough transnational cooperation and partnership, the mutual benefits and impact Edumob will ensure a long lasting and sustainable legacy for future European cooperation projects.", "http://www.pointeuropa.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA104-014112_2"], ["1AS", "Star Gazy Sustainable Health", "Point Europa", 17951.0, "The overall aim of this project is, to give young people with fewer opportunities self-perception and self esteem.

All of the volunteers will be drawn from backgrounds of very restricted opportunity and will come to learn a variety of practical \u2018shipwright-type\u2019 skills as well as the softer skills of team playing, team leadership and cross-cultural communication which will serve them well as they progress through the rest of their lives. The Youthpass will be used, not only as a recognition of the volunteer\u2019s non-formal learning outcomes,  but also to structure and frame their individual learning plans. The boat itself, a tangible, touchable object, is also a symbol or metaphor of the approach and objectives of this project and on the other hand the film - are symbols of: - The volunteers\u2019 life journies (e.g their experience of rough conditions/stormy weather through to successful new beginnings)- The boat\u2019s history \u2013 having once been a successful fishing vessel, damage through use, disuse and age means it is now desperately in need of improvement and renovation- The boat - a bridge between history and the 21st century environment, a linking across generations.- From filming to cutting and editing the volunteers will be involved in the whole process and will get the chance to face different tasks in the development of a film.On completion of the restoration, the volunteers will, ceremoniously, take the boat out onto the sea under the direction of an expert fisherman and go fishing. At the end of the project the boat will remain in the community as a resource to be used by local youth, future groups of volunteers and other community organisations. The same is meant for the film the finished production will be  screened in the village aswell in the AK-Tirol in Innsbruck. Each the community and the volunteers will get an edition for their personal use. The \u2018star gazy\u2019 name is taken from a Cornish fish speciality strongly associated with the well-known fishing village of Mousehole.

The vocational training covered by this application is in the fields of automation, manufakturing, construction, aeronautics, vehicles, hotel and restaurant and child care. The consortium has an ongoing Erasmus+ KA102 project with 88 mobilities since 2014, Building Bridges. This project application is made for the continuation of that project when it finishes in the summer of 2016, thus the name Building Bridges 2. The hosting partners are eight schools/VET providers in France, Spain, UK, Lithuania and Portugal. The project is planned to last for two more years 2016-2018.The name is chosen because the project aims at building bridges between the Swedish consortium and the participating partner organisations, between schools and business, between different ways of working, between cultures and countries. In doing so, the applicant and the partners will continue to provide qualified and adequate placements for students and teachers in the EU. The application is aiming at the possibility for 82 students to do part of their VET-training in the partner countries, and for 10 teachers to do job-shadowing, exchanging experience, training and possibly try teaching in the same partner organisations. The consortium has well-established relations with the partner organisations, some from many years and some more recent. They are all based on long-term relationships, and the partners have been found to be reliable, with mutual areas of interest. The cooperation is of benefit for all involved. The hosting partners of this application will apply for corresponding projects, and the project is expected to be the basis for a continued good cooperation between the applicant and the partners with mutual exchanges. Within the consortium, there is a natural interaction as all members belong to the same organisation, in addition there is a team of contact persons chaired by the coordinators EU-coordinator. The team meets for joint planning, follow-up and evaluation.Participating students are expected to have improved knowledge within their field of work in a way that can be approved as part of their studies in accordance with the Swedish curriculum (Gy 11). They are given the opportunity to try their skills in a new context and surrounding, learn to adapt and become more independent, both professionally and socially. They also become more motivated and accustomed to taking personal responsibility for their studies and for their work. This in turn provides greater opportunities for the completion of studies and future social inclusion. They take part of another culture and are made aware of the possibility to seek employment within the EU. They are developing their European identity and are given the possibility to use other languages. Their employability is strengthened with an improved CV.The teachers in the exchange acquire new skills and knowledge, both from learning from others and from reflecting on their own practices. They experience personal growth and new ways of thinking.  As the participating teachers are transforming the knowledge they acquire into their schools, it becomes a tool for organisational development and competency enhancement, not only for themselves, but for the organisation as a whole.

On a practical side, more support such as methodological handbooks or diverse activities offering further exploration of advanced, participatory and sustainable approaches and underlying theories is needed. Therefore, a group of trainers, facilitators, youth workers, together with organisations working in this field developed this project to share and to further develop existing concepts, theories and approaches.The project is aiming at gathering around 20 educational experts from Germany, Austria, France, Czech Republic, Armenia, Serbia, Montenegro, UK and Belarus active in the European youth field (trainers, facilitators and youth workers) to explore together the issues mentioned above.The activity will be a  4 days' seminar taking place in Berlin to explore the current debates and developments in the different regions and in the frame of the work of the participants and the participating organisations. It aims to give impulses for further developments in the frame of European youth work and the Erasmus+ programme.The seminar programme will contain presentations - designed and delivered by the participants - concerning theories, concepts and methods in terms of (inter-)culture, ambiguity and change as well as the diversity and inclusion strategies in non-formal and international youth work in our countries. A fundamental element of the project will be the development of ideas to further qualify the field of non-formal learning in European youth work, concerning our topics.Another part will focus on the sharing of methods and approaches and the identification of common ground to be able to move forwards as a platform and produce effective outputs that will benefit young people across Europe. The methods will be very much non-formal and participatory as the main aim of the activity is sharing. The sharing of developments and methods needs participants to be involved in a meaningful and effective way, so there will be the encouragement of ownership and leadership of the content and the platform for all.

Through the design of participatory learning programs, in which both older and young people are able to learn and share in a mutual way. To this end, we believe it is important to equip ourselves with the knowledge and skills of leaders in the design of such programs.\r\n2.

To improve the didactic competences of our trainers, and to enable them to develop innovative programs that promote experiential and participatory learning.\r\n2.

The experience of previous projects has been drawn on in this current application, and is expected to lead to further improvements in all aspects of the project.\r\nThe name is chosen because the project aims at building bridges between the Swedish consortium and the participating partner organisations, between schools and business, between different ways of working, between cultures and countries.
