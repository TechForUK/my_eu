To ensure that we are fully prepared for this challenge and to improve the existing language learning for pupils at school, we aim to send four members of staff with some language skills, over a period of 24 months, on eight day language immersion courses in France. \r\n\r\nThe course provides 14 hours of high quality language lessons from native speakers. In order to prepare for the course, staff will be offered extra language lessons, prior to travelling and these sessions will also be delivered by a native speaker. Once in France, staff will be taught in groups according to their language ability and will be encouraged to speak in the target language as much as possible and communicate with local people. They will be fully supported and monitored by the course providers. \r\n\r\nThe course also includes a day in a French primary school and a wide range of carefully chosen cultural activities, with the aim of giving staff a sense of culture and to increase their subject knowledge. Staff will create a bank of resources and ideas to take back to school, to enable them to be more effective teachers. By maintaining a link with the school, staff will be able to develop and participate in future projects, such as job shadowing opportunities.\r\n\r\nParticipants are already part of a local language network, which aims to become stronger as a result of the project, enabling staff to support each other. Total immersion will challenge staff to use their language skills, which will then give them a greater confidence in their own abilities. The main objectives are to increase the level of competency across the whole school, so that language learning can be sustained, to increase cultural awareness amongst pupils so that they become global citizens and to establish and maintain a link with a partner primary school so that pupils can experience communicating and working with real pupils in another country.\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that the long term benefits of the training will be the delivery of high quality language learning throughout the whole school, with French completely embedded within the curriculum.", "http://www.cinnamonbrowceprimaryschool.co.uk", "Cinnamon Brow CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-000171_coordinator"], ["0QJ", "Christ Church: a French speaking school", "Christ Church CE Primary School", 2010.0, "We are a primary school wanting to improve our language provision.

The Senior Leadership Team comprises of a Head Teacher, a Deputy Head with 50% teaching, two  Teaching and Learning Responsibility teachers for Literary and Numeracy and one for Special Educational Needs.\r\n\r\nDue to the forthcoming introduction of compulsory language learning for Key Stage 2 in September the school feels that the subject needs to have a higher profile. There needs to be higher confidence in staff's ability to speak French so that more members of staff can be involved in language teaching; new and more engaging ways of delivering lessons  and up to date and relevant resources. Furthermore, the school wishes to form a link with a French school in order to improve its European dimension.\r\n\r\nThe school plans to send two participants, over a one year period, on a suitable 8 day language and methodology course which it has identified. The course consists of a combination of language learning, cultural activities, methodology and pedagogy as well as a one day job shadowing opportunity in a French school.  \r\n\r\nThe participants are being identified via a school skills audit which looks at National Qualifications obtained as well as looking for candidates who are motivated, enthusiastic and keen to share their knowledge. The participants are also carrying out language self assessments using Europass. The first participant to attend the course is a Teaching Assistant currently devising and delivering French lessons to all Key Stage 2 children during 50 minute weekly sessions. Although she holds a French degree it was obtained in 1989 and her confidence is currently low.\r\n\r\nThe project will be managed and monitored throughout by the Senior Leadership Team who will ensure that it is fully prepared. It will keep in regular contact with the course provider to ensure that all preliminary preparations are completed. All channels of communication will be kept open prior to, during and following the trip. Staff members, governors, children and parents will be kept fully up to date with the impending trip through a series of meetings, newsletters and via the school website. The children will have a direct input into the course by providing letters/emails to the French school and by devising questions which the participants will need to find answers to whilst away. The school will assist the participants by ensuring that  aspects of safe keeping e.g. emergency contacts, insurance etc. are in place and that there is regular contact with both parties whilst they are away.\r\n\r\nThe finding of a European link school forms part of the School's Development Plan. A meeting has taken place between the first participant and a member of the Senior Leadership Team and the project has been linked into her Professional Development Plan.  This will be regularly reviewed during the forthcoming year. It is anticipated that following the trip changes will be implemented into the School's Modern Foreign Languages Policy.\r\n\r\nFollowing the course the relevant project outcomes will be disseminated to the various stakeholders via a variety of means: meetings, presentations, question and answer sessions, website, newsletter and newspaper. \r\n\r\nAll outcomes will be evaluated both on the return of the participants and then throughout the year during review meetings.\r\n\r\nIt is envisaged that as a result of the project staff will have enhanced language skills; will have a greater enthusiasm and confidence in the delivery of lessons; will be able to engage the children in more creative ways; will be able to provide a more European dimension to learning cross curriculum via authentic learning resources and will have a link in place with a French school which will greatly improve the cultural awareness of our pupils. As a result of this we will hopefully develop our pupils' enthusiasm for continued language learning as they move into Secondary Education and beyond and will open their eyes to new cultures, enabling them to develop into effective global citizens.

Many experienced staff left the school and were replaced by teachers at the beginning of their career.In a drive by our Leadership team to increase standards and improve outcomes for all, there is a commitment to seek new and innovative approaches to teaching and learning. Through the innovative and creative teaching practices of our European counterparts, we aim to implement shared experiences that will result in our children understanding that they are part of an international learning community. The project's objectives are to:1. Gain knowledge of successful leadership models. 2. Develop staff confidence to gain innovative and creative approaches. 3. Improving standards. The newly formed leadership team have highlighted the need for all staff to become immersed in the creative and innovative teaching approaches that the international training courses provide. It is our intention to continue our teachers professional development in order to improve teaching and learning across the school. With this in mind, we aim to send four members of our Leadership Team to Sweden and Finland to look more closely at the successes of each individual country's education system.  It is our aim that ten of our staff will take part in mobilities linked to creativity and innovation. The expected impact of the mobilities will be a staff that are more confident in their own abilities, have raised self esteem and increased enthusiasm for delivering innovative and creative lessons that address the needs of our children and the school. Furthermore, the children will benefit from an increased knowledge of European countries and how they compare and contrast to their own country. As a result of improved self confidence our staff will use the pedagogical methodologies, gained during their training, to inform planning and deliver lessons that inspire and motivate the children. This will happen across the curriculum. In order to maximise the training undertaken, staff will disseminate their learning to other members of staff during staff meetings and Inset training days. Through these mobilities we will create strong partnerships with teachers and schools, which the staff encounter abroad.

Finally, through this immersion, young people understand more the need of learning another language. \r\n\r\nThe expected impacts on the apprentices are: \r\n- Personal fulfillment and development: Personal opening another operation, development of autonomy and maturity, self-recognition; \r\n- Active citizenship: evolution of personal representations of Europe: through these projects, Europe gets closer to citizens who are often quite distant from it; \r\n- Social inclusion and employment: professional skills, employability, language immersion, greater interdisciplinary. \r\n\r\nThese 3 elements overlap the components of the key competencies listed in the Regulation [EU] No 1288/2013 establishing the Erasmus + program. Company tutors, the first two elements are quite relevant; however a stronger relationship with company in designing training path is the main aspect of this exchange of practices and experiences.\r\n\r\nThe management scheme is that CCCA-BTP provides coordination, animation, administrative support and pedagogical coherence of the whole project. The CFAs build partnership relations with host organizations; provide logistical and pedagogical organization while monitoring of participants. Mobility Teams are dedicated to this in the CFAs, and an ad hoc steering committee within the CCCA-BTP which deals also with the ECEVT implementation.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve 762 apprentices (9 trades and 2 levels of certification) and 25 company tutor.", "http://www.warrington.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-035778_2"], ["8QA", "2015-1-FI01-KA109-009209", "WARRINGTON COLLEGIATE", 127316.0, "November 2016 CIMO run the \"System Check\" for Sataedu's internationalization activities. According to the report of the check, management and processes of Sataedu's internationalization activities are high quality, and the planning of the mobilities is very proactive. In addition, internationalization is seen in very wide scope in Sataedu, where many different actions support each other. Behind all this can be found management's strong commitment to the internationalization.  Sataedu's new strategy will be put to the market during this spring 2017, at which time also internationalization's importance will rise higher than before. The action plan of the international activites will be updated after the strategy publication, in autumn 2017.\r\n\r\nSATAMOVE 4 mobilities continue SATAMOVE 2 and SATAMOVE 3 projects' good practices. Our goal is still to improve students' graduation and to increase their possibilities to get employed in Finland and in Europe, by executing high quality, min. 5 weeks' internship with such a partners, who are familiar with our internship's content and way of assessment,  throughout our Learning Agreement.\r\n\r\n5-10 weeks' internship consist of the orientation period of the recieving organisation, tutoring action during the whole period, work practise, continuing self evaluation by means of blog writing, intermediate- and final evaluation by means of work place tutor and the culture visits by the partner organisation.\r\n\r\nOur participating students are 18 years old, motivated and target oriented young adults. During the next school year, following study fields will participate in this project with next amount of students: Hair & Beauty 8, Audio-Visual 8, Car Mechanic 8, Logistics 2, Electricity 8, Shoemaker 4, Construction 2, Tourism 2, Hotel- and Catering 8, Business 2, Photograph 4, Animation 4, Graphic Design 4,  Social and Health Care 8, Craft and Skills 2. In total 74 mobilities. \r\n\r\nRegarding our 14 days' expert mobilities, 4 mobilities are from Social  Health care sector to Germany and 2 mobilities to from education technology to Spain and Germany. \r\nSince our organization was reformed in the beginning of 2017, we are eager to find new know-how to our executive board members. For that reason we are cooperating with organizations similar to FI AMKE, AoC in UK and MBORaad in the Netherlands. Both organizations are familiar with Sataedu  throughout E+ KA2 project and EUproVET. Those two organizations have more than 100 VET providers as their members, so we are sure that our topics will be met during the periods.\r\nThe subjects during the period are pedagogical and organization management, quality management, HR and finance management. Periods are planned so that 3 persons will move to AoC targets and during the other mobility period 2 persons to MBORaad.", "http://www.warrington.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034419_16"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA2"}
