These molecular alloys allow for adjustment of the melting point and lead to a significantly increased energy density compared not only to that of their components, but also to that of n-alkanes molecular alloys. Furthermore sugar alcohols permit high levels of undercooling thus minimizing the risk for spontaneous PCM solidification and at the same time reducing insulation requirements as well as thermal losses during long term storage. The application of a local thermal shock or ultrasound will induce nucleation and subsequent crystallization thus provoking easy discharge of the storage system.\n\nLike most PCM, sugar alcohols due to their low thermal conductivity (typically < 1 W/m/K) impose a principal heat transfer problem on the storage design.

It will take place from November 18th to December 21st 2017 in Peterborough (Cambridgeshire, England) with the same intermediary organization partner (EUROSTAFF) for the 8th time. The four weeks\u2019 work experience will be preceded by three days of linguistic, cultural and professional integration organised by EUROSTAFF and financed by the school funds and a contribution from the families.\r\n\r\nAre concerned by the project from the beginning:\r\n- the headmaster,\r\n- the deputy head,\r\n- the accountant,\r\n- the vocational section head,\r\n- the English teacher & the vocational training English teacher,\r\n- the teachers who are in charge of the class,\r\n- the regional council and the local education authority (LEA),\r\n- the trainees and their parents.\r\n\r\nThis three years\u2019 BTEC was created in September 2006 responding to the request of the vice-chancellor of Versailles Local Education Authority. The concomitant opening of the European section was a school initiative to be in conformity with the school project entitled \"Personal culture and international opening\".\r\nAs a matter of fact, our students will have to work on a market in constant evolution, with foreign suppliers and customers. In order to increase their chances to be hired, it is necessary for them to be fluent in English. We are the only school in the area to offer this qualification with this option. Vincent Van Gogh School, inaugurated in 1991, welcomes 1137 students who come from 5 local areas and from the working classes localities - Mantes, Les Mureaux and Aubergenville.\r\n\r\nThe 10 students concerned by this mobility project represent this social diversity, and they are all preparing a BTEC in Administrative Duties and Management with the European option in English. They have to carry out a four weeks\u2019 work experience in a British firm where they will work on administrative tasks, adapted to their professional and English levels.
