Since it is a water-based PTO system, the risks of oil leaks in the ocean will also be fully eliminated. The system and components developed will have a broad range of applications, from wave energy, as the main application area, to water desalinization and small hydro power generation, and will therefore benefit a European value chain of SMEs specialised in engineering and green energy generation. To achieve our objectives, we need to develop new scientific knowledge in: design of innovative system components such as a variable speed generator, an adaptative blade turbine, elastomeric structures and the overall hydraulic system; protective coatings for marine environments; modeling the ageing of elastomeric structures; and wireless controlled monitoring of offshore moving equipment. Due to the technical challenges of testing the system, there was a conscious decision to hold the activities of AQUAGEN during a 39 month period. Whilst the SMEs form a supply chain for the manufacture of the ultimate PTO system we have neither the facilities nor the resources to undertake the necessary R&D. The Research for SMEs funding instrument provides the ideal solution, allowing us to outsource the R&D to four RTD Performers \u2013 VP, NTNU, UM and CMG. The Foreground Intellectual Property (FIP) generated in the AQUAGEN project will be owned and exploited by the SMEs, envisaging several market segments and a geographical distribution of non-exclusive licenses for markets outside Europe.

In this way, not only the personal development of the learners is promoted but also the possibility of getting a job on the (European) labour market. Additionally, it counteracts prospective youth unemployment. Therefore, the Elisabeth-Selbert-Schule can support the professional development of  the students and promote the quality of the apprenticeship and the further education. \r\nWithin the scope of this project the participants should be able to recognize the differences of the vocational systems and evaluate them. Moreover, practical skills are provided, a sensitisation for other cultures is initiated and flexibility and independent working are ensured. \r\nThrough the work in other vocational- or social facilities the participants are able to learn new methods and gain experience, which can be applied in their own working environment and it can be passed on to other learners. In this way the learners\u2019 competences are promoted and the curiosity towards new trends is aroused. Especially jobs in the catering trade require local flexibility. Therefore, the first steps within the programme are decisive for the further process.   \r\nFurthermore, a placement abroad supports the natural handling with other people and foreign cultures. These are factors that play a great role in the service sector and also in jobs that deal with people, who have special needs. This target group is particular important because they are a minority of whom the learners can profit a lot. After successfully completing the stay abroad the sense of self-esteem and the personality of the learners are strengthened.   \r\nBack in their home country the learners pass on their newly learned knowledge and experience along with a detailed evaluation of the vocational system. \r\nThe intercultural aspects play a substantial role for the nursery nurse trainees, because they are visiting countries without speaking the native language. Therefore, the students have to be more sensitive towards requirements and the behaviour of people of the target culture. Cultural openness and curiosity are essential, especially regarding the work with parents of children who have a migratory background. But also getting into contact with children by using the body language enables the learners to lay special focus on gestures, mimic and the overall behaviour. This is usually not possible in the dense school curriculum of the learners. Everyone included in the exchange can only profit from such cultural diversity. The acquired experience of the nursery nurse trainees can be applied to different working fields during the training course. E.g. the learners are able to find different ways of communicating. This can be helpful if the communication of a child is restricted in some way. \r\nForeign language learning should be an additional goal in the different branches of the work experience. Standardized learning results and the specific understanding between the partner institutions are the criteria for a quality-assured assessment. This makes the acknowledgement of the acquired knowledge and competences possible. \r\nFor this it is necessary that every person involved, including the participating learners, have to have a clear understanding of what has to be learned and how this is documented within the scope of the Europass. The utilisation of the standardized ECVET-Instrument (Memorandum of Understanding/Learning Agreement/Learning standards/Europass) makes the transfer of duties for the quality-assured mobility project easier.", "http://www.kendal.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE02-KA102-001946_12"], ["5AY", "Clusterprojekt f\u00fcr die Luft- und Raumfahrt", "Kendal college", 44566.0, "The cluster project for the aerospace industry has its origins in 2007.

This not only encourages the personal development of the learners, but also improves their employment opportunities on the (European) labor market, which counteracts the unemployment of many young people. This allows the Elisabeth-Selbert School to support the professional development of young people and to promote the quality of teaching, training and learning.\r\nIn the framework of this project the participants will recognize and evaluate the differences in vocational education and training systems, provide practical skills and supplement them, and initiate sensitization to other cultures, flexibility and self-employment. The work in other training enterprises or social institutions creates the possibility for participants to get to know new and / or other working methods, which they can apply and pass on afterwards. This underpins the workspace of the participants, makes the participants safer and more open to new trends and methods. In particular, catering professionals require local flexibility so that the first steps in the project are crucial for their future professional career.\r\nThe self-understanding of dealing with foreign people, with foreign cultures, which is expected in the services of gastronomy and personal care, can only be promoted by an internship abroad. In the TN of the Healing Disability / Personal Assistance and Care Assistance, an important role is played by the fact that elderly disabled people hardly exist and thus new experiences with these target groups can be mediated.\r\nCompleting or practicing an internship strengthens self-esteem and gives the participants their own personality. In the home country itself, the knowledge and experience gained and the critical examination of different training procedures are passed on. The intercultural aspect will be the focus of the pupils of the Fachschule Sozialp\u00e4dagogik, which is very personal. The language of the host country does not understand and does not speak makes sensitive to the emotional condition of people with similar background. With regard to the parents' work in children's day-care centers with families with an immigration background and the educational work with the children, this understanding creates a cultural openness which can only be positively expressed in the corresponding implementation of pedagogical measures, A contact with children with gestures and facial expressions, with pantomimic signs, creates a sensitivity for observations of behaviors of other people, which can only be experienced in such situations and often can not be mediated in this intensity. This experience creates a great empathy for the participants in the field of social pedagogy in professional fields, where people are very linguistically limited and other ways of communication have to be found.\r\nIn some areas of this project the foreign language skills of the participants can be improved.\r\nThe criteria of the quality assurance of learning abroad abroad will in future be the orientation to learning outcomes and the understanding of the partner institutions (Memorandum of Understanding). This enables us to ensure the recognition of the acquired learning outcomes and competences. This requires that all stakeholders - including the learners - have a concrete idea of \u200b\u200bwhat is learned and how this is to be recorded. Documented in Europass mobility, these learning results can then be validated and calculated in the home country.\r\nThe use of the standardized ECVET instruments (Memorandum of Understandanding / Learning Standards / Europass) facilitates the implementation of quality-assured mobility.\r\nThe desire to expand the circle of participants by already educated educators of the district of Hameln-Pyrmont on the Erasmus exchange to Trontheim, Norway, organized by the ESS for years, lies in the widening of the viewpoints by other concepts of the PISA winners with regard to early childhood education and support systems.", "http://www.kendal.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA102-003853_12"], ["5AY", "Clusterprojekt f\u00fcr die Luft- und Raumfahrt", "Kendal college", 43037.0, "The cluster project for the aerospace industry has its origins in 2007.
