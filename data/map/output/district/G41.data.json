In this way, the making of a sense of European citizenship, through a constant flow of teachers and students from other partner institutions, and the promotion of foreign languages learning and teaching, have been some of the main priorities in the philosophy of IES A Sangri\u00f1a.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the present project has a main purpose, the observation of new methodologies in the teaching of foreign languages, both being understood as pure subjects and through the CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning).  In our case, a teacher will be sent to a French school in order to follow-up the teaching of the Spanish language as a foreign language. And two of our teachers will be sent to two different British schools to deepen and observe the teaching methodology of their subjects being taught in English (in this case Physical Education and History). At the same time, the contact with other schools will provide participants with new perspectives and initiatives for European cooperation, mainly in the framework of Erasmus+ program.\r\n\r\nAll the participants are active members of the international team of IES A Sangri\u00f1a, and for this reason, they have a remarkable and wide background to tackle a project like this: an active and tolerant European consciousness and, above all, the certainty that the teacher training is essential to provide our students with a comprehensive education and future prospects.\r\n\r\nThe activities that will be carried out in their host schools are observation and direct participation in teaching activities, both as complementary and extracurricular teaching. Further meetings are planned with the teacher staff, educational authorities, parents associations and other institutions in the area with a different educational offer. The methodology of this project will be immersion in the life of the host school, so participants could feel another member of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe expected results are acquiring new perspectives, methodologies and teaching approaches, improving communication skills (linguistic and social) and the opening of new avenues of European cooperation.

He is currently working with a circus company called Bright Night International as part of the Commonwealth Youth Circus and is particularly interested in social circus (circus trainings and activities with children who have fewer possibilities) as he would like to become a youth worker.  \r\n\r\nDuring his stay with Circusplaneet, he wil work on learning Dutch, becoming a better performer, and develop Clowning and other circus teaching skills, particularly in a social circus environment.

Youth unemployment rates are historically four to five times more than the adult rates in every country in the world. In 2012, youth made up to 40% of the world unemployed. Close to 75 million youth were unemployed worldwide. The quality and relevance of education is often considered as the first root cause of youth unemployment. Yet, high education does not guarantee a decent job. One global survey found that more than 55% of employers worldwide believe there is a \u201cskill crisis\u201d as businesses witness a growing mismatch between the skills students learn in the education system and those required in the workplace. \r\nWithin the frameworks of this project we want to promote volunteering as an important tool for unemployment solution. Different types of volunteering \u2013 short-termed and long-termed EVS, engagement with local CSOs and charities, internships in NGOs and businesses \u2013 all these types of activities increase person\u2019s chances for employment. Volunteering a person gets new skills and knowledge, learns useful tools, gets experience of teamwork and subordination. In many cases the experience of volunteering changes the person\u2019s attitudes towards their life plans changing the direction of what kind of employment they are looking for. Volunteering creates new working places, develops entrepreneurship, contributes to person\u2019s CV.\r\nThere are different levels of youth involvement into volunteering activities in different countries. While in Western Europe it\u2019s quite common for students to take a year off studies to volunteer abroad or to be involved in number of local charities, in Eastern Europe and Caucasus and Mediterranean countries it\u2019s still something strange and foreign. Raising awareness of volunteering opportunities in these countries may turn beneficial for students, young unemployed graduates, organisations \u2013 NGOs and developed business enterprises, society in general. Using methods of non-formal education we want to promote volunteering activities and for this to establish a network for volunteering opportunities for the young people in different NGOs around Eastern and Western Europe, Balkans, Caucasus and Mediterranean countries. It will help to make people from these countries closer to each other, to exchange experience, project ideas and stories of success. With the help of existing youth programs young people from Western Europe will volunteer in Eastern Europe and vice versa. During our TC we plan to give the participants space to create their future projects related to volunteering, to make the participants use their creativity to develop new approaches of volunteering, to establish informal contacts necessary to this task. \r\nObjectives: 1. to establish good connections between the young people from participating countries; 2. to transfer the good practices in the field of youth work, cultural diversity and social inclusion; 3. to promote volunteering activities and for this to establish a network of organisations involved in volunteering of the young people in different NGOs around Eastern and Western Europe, Balkans, Caucasus and Mediterranean countries.\r\nThe participating countries are: Austria, Israel, Netherlands, UK from countries with better employment situation and more developed volunteering programs and Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYROM, Georgia, Greece, Jordan,  Romania, Russia, Turkey,  Ukraine with very bad situation with youth unemployment and volunteering opportunities. With these partners we have a good set of Project and Partner (50/50) for the aims of this project and the variety of skills, experience and competences to have great discussions that will allow us to share the tools the participants and their NGOs could use in their future work with youth for the promotion of volunteering and to create new approaches for future projects and international cooperation. The group will consist of 27 participants (youth workers) plus 3 facilitators.\r\nThe 7 days long TC will take place October 8-16, 2015 in Yerevan, Armenia. The working methods will be discussions, work in pairs, trios, small and big groups, interactive role-playing games, icebreakers, team-building, simulations, intercultural and other parties, energizers, daily evaluations etc. The participants will be given a chance to act as trainers/facilitators.

The service provides a hot meal every day, homework supervision and a range of developmental activities \u2013 drama, art, music, swimming, sports, gardening and arts and crafts etc.  The project will be based on the social and personal development of the young people through activity based programmes.This EVS project aims to develop links with other parts of Europe so that young people from different countries will have an experience of different cultures. The participants will learn more about the Irish culture as they immerse themselves in it, and also about youth work practices within an Irish context. The young people that we work with at Aisling Project will learn about their fellow Europeans \u2013 gaining an insight into Spanish, Italian and French cultures in a way they may not have the opportunity to otherwise.Our intention is to provide the participants with many opportunities to gain valuable experience and skills in working with young people and in living abroad - under the supervision of a coordinator, and with the support of colleagues and a mentor. We hope that this personal and professional development will lead to increased employability following the project.The project will have 5 participants from various programme countries. The participants will all have a demonstrated interest in working with children, a belief in helping young people achieve their true potential and be aged between 21 and 30. We are open to candidates of all backgrounds, including those with fewer opportunities, providing that we have the capacity to cater to their needs and provide a quality project that will achieve the objectives outlined in the Erasmus + Programme Guide, meeting the needs of both the participants and the organisation.The participants, along with other members of the team, will assist the children with homework, and provide other developmental and purposeful activities thought to enhance the young person\u2019s ability to remain in school, their developmental progression and their resilience to everyday stresses and challenges. They will be involved in the day-to-day planning, implementation and delivery of the activities described above. They will also have the opportunity to plan and develop their own programmes for the children that interest them, with the support of their supervisor and colleagues.  The paticipants will be asked to complete some office work at different times.They will work from 11.00am until 18.30pm Monday to Thursday and 11.00am to 13.00pm on Friday The volunteers will work during Irish school term and will be off for the school holidays. However they will be asked to work extra hours from time to time to cover residential trips, summer projects and outings during the school  holidays. We hope that this project will provide the participants with invaluable experience of working in the youth field, develop their intercultural awareness and provide them with skills for living in an unfamiliar place. We also hope as a result of the participants being in the project, the young people we work with will have a broader knowledge of Europe, and experience of other cultures.", "http://www.xchangescotland.org", null, "erasmus_2016-2-IE01-KA105-016979_1"], ["1BA", "Youthworker 2.0", "XCHANGE SCOTLAND", 45398.0, "The applicant and the partner organisations have been in contact through the Alliance of European Voluntary Service Organisations.

That\u2019s why this project identified several concrete needs of these networks and developed 3 Training Courses to support quality of our activities by raising competencies of youth workers in our networks and support sharing of experience.Overall objectives:- The youth workers improve their ability to independently and reliably work with groups of participants/youth, while reflecting  their special needs.- The youth workers know what makes their activities of a high-quality and it is important for them to continue working with youth on a high-quality level.- They apply methods and tools to maintain their motivation and energy.- They boost their creativity and entrepreneurship skills by making up new activities, projects and partnerships and inspire other youth workers and organisations in the Alliance by multiplying the results of the projectOverview of the Activities:Activity 1: Youthworker 2.0.1: How to work with complicated participants? - hosted  in the Czech Republic on 19 - 26/9 2016Activity 2: Youthworker 2.0.2: How to work with participants with special needs? - hosted  in Hungary between 20 - 27/2/2017Activity 3: Youthworker 2.0.3: How to work with attitudes on international projects? - hosted in Czech Republic between 5-12/6/2017Each of the activity is designed for 24 youth workers as participants + 3 trainers and 2 support staff, altogether 29 people participating. Methods will come out of non-formal education: group work, role plays, simulations, brainstorming etc. Main impact: Improved quality of activities the participants are organising will positively influence their target groups (young people, who will have better overview on the educational progress they\u2019re doing) and the organisations they work for and cooperate with.

It is also hoped that there will be an increase in the amount of young people taking part in such activities, leading to an increase in the skills and experience, their intercultural competences, understanding of their role as active citizens and their participantion in the democratic lives of their communities.The project shall also create a new partnership between a range of organisations that had never collaborated before, with the possibility of future joint projects as a result of a successful implementation of this project.", "http://www.xchangescotland.org", "XCHANGE SCOTLAND", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023990_coordinator"], ["4HS", "Comunicando", "Craigholme School", 11213.0, "Our school develops a Teachers\u2019 training programme at the beginning of every school year which is implemented later on,  at different moments during the school year. It\u2019s based on a previous detection of the teachers\u2019 training needs in our school and it seeks for the inclusion of training, evaluative and innovative activities. In order to prioritize,  and make sure that the above mentioned needs are taken into account and included in our training programme, our school counts on the help of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes.\r\n This Department, in an attempt to give an answer to the training needs, seeks for the participation in programmes such as Erasmus+ Ka1 since we think that this kind of programme is a guarantee for us to get the objectives related to the previously detected needs. \r\n\r\nAt IES Chaves Nogales, we are constantly doing our best to improve the quality of teaching since we know well that it affects considerably students\u2019 learning and outcome. As teachers too, we  constantly keep in mind the importance of giving an answer to our students\u2019 needs. They  are very important and valuable for us and in this sense, we usually need to go beyond making reports or using statistics.\r\nOur main goal is that students are able to manage by themselves in their social world. For that reason, we have developed some work strategies which take into consideration the following: collaborative team work, the library as an element for cultural dissemination, the necessary involvement of students\u2019 families in the school library and the use of social networks as a tool for communication within an educational environment.\r\n\r\nConsequently, by taking into account all the strategies mentioned above, we have detected that those activities which are susceptible to some kind of improvement in our school can be divided into three main areas of interest. They are the following:\r\n\r\nWorking collaboratively in the planning,  elaboration and development  of Content Units. Also, the collaborative implementation of projects and activities by students\u2019 families, teachers , pupils, scientific community, social agents, etc.\r\nRevitalising and dynamizing the library by supplying it with new formats and communication systems so that it may be transformed into a MEDIA LIBRARY.        Also carrying out regular activities which contribute to the dissemination of culture and the full  integration of the whole school community members.\r\nFostering social competence and strategies for good and effective communication when using social networks, including the e-twinning platform. In both cases, under the framework of interdisciplinary learning contexts, the efficient use of language as a means of communication achieves a special relevance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding  teachers\u2019 training needs, the most notorious are those which would allow us to conceive Learning communities as a feasible reality in our educational environment. Last but not least important is the challenge of transforming our Library in a \u201csource of resources\u201d, a real Media library , which would become a central axis for the search of knowledge in our school or a starting point from which any search of knowledge would be carried out. In this sense the library would encourage multidirectional communication among all the members of the school community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo finish, in the next school year training period, we will keep on pursuing our objectives by sharing the acquired experience and by inviting other colleagues to participate in a seminary dealing with the different areas of interest established in our project. Furthermore, the project could also become extensive to other schools which could be interested in it, including the Primary schools usually assigned to our school.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our school blog and our profile in some social networking services such as Twitter- also linked to the blog- will be constantly updated. This will allow us to disseminate in an open and extensive way our already acquired experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe IES Chaves Nogales has always proved its willingness to internationalize the teaching process as it has successfully demonstrated with the creation of the Department for National and International Plans and Programmes. Thanks to this Department the innovative knowledge and information acquired during the mobility and European cooperation period will also be disseminated through the different didactic programmings.

This rising dynamic between international partnerships and institutional exchanges needs to be reinforced to an operational and citizen level. The aim of Twin\u2019Go is to use this springboard (the wishes of the international development of the cities) and to make it available to the associations and especially for the youngsters. Actually young people are often the missing ones in international partnerships, town twinnings and other economic partnership agreements. With the project Twin\u2019Go, Eurocircle propose to live up youth projects within the existing partnerships of Marseille and (therefore) to benefit effectively of the most positive dimensions/elements of the European Union and the globalization in general. The youngsters could develop their professional abilities, reinforce their international openness, practice one or more foreign languages, confirm their training, expand their networks\u2026\r\nThe foreseen activities of the Twin\u2019Go project are multifaceted, and able to cause the curiosity and motivation of the young people: activities related to the communication of an important city/district, missions related to the European citizenship within Eurocircle, engagement to reinforce the relations between France and Germany and the development of projects for European mobility in Bulgaria. Resolutely oriented towards European actions fulfillment, our project also includes parallel sportive activities like a sportive and cultural exchange project organized by Eurocircle, as well as communication and promotion of the city of Marseille\u2019s activities around the context of Marseille-Provence as the \u00ab European capital of sport 2017 \u00bb. \r\n\r\nMore generally Twin\u2019Go is also part of a big project that involves the international mobility of EVS, French Civic Services, Ecological French-German Volunteering, and professional internships between the international cooperation zones of the city of Marseille. The project Twin\u2019Go wants to involve all in all 20 youngsters into these different programs. The result of this first expected edition for the period 2017-2018 and the jointly sending and hosting of young people in Marseille and its partner cities, should implement new relationships which can be expanded during the following years. That is actually the fervent desire of the city of Marseille.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to favor the inclusion of the participants and their employability. The OECD ciphers the unemployment of the youngsters aged 15 to 24 at a rate of more than 20% in the European Union in 2015; the opportunities of mobility aim as well the remobilization of young people, to give or to give back to them confidence into themselves, to make them increase their autonomy, to make them discover a new field of activities as well as a new manner to learn by means of non-formal education.

The 1st part will be self-reflective, focused on self-awareness. The participants will be guided by methods of coaching to sensitize their own approach and attitudes regarding leadership, reflect on their behaviour, characteristics and inner motivation. For the purposes of our project, we will closely connect this attitude reflection with leadership in projects (in positions of campleaders, coordinators etc.) and will use it as essential base for the second, practical part of the trainings. The second, practical part of the 1st training will be focused on coaching and mentoring methods in supporting the groups; the 2nd training will focus its second part on team and project management.

As we state in the title of this project, we are convinced that as teachers we must rethink on the skills and abilities which are needed in the 21st century. It is essential to move towards more innovative methodologies based on equity, inclusion and suitable for life in a digital and multicultural society.\r\n\r\nTherefore we have defined the following improvement areas:\r\n1. Transformation of the culture of the organization and of the educational practices in order to  meet the diversity of educational needs of our students.\r\n2. Development of the digital skills needed to live and work in the era of digital transformation. Use of collaborative platforms and development of assessment tools to guarantee the quality throughout the process.\r\n3.

Implementation of an Interculturality Plan which will reflect the social, ethnic and linguistic diversity present at our school and society.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of innovative methodologies and the use of ICT in all areas will meet the demands of the labour market in the 21st century.

For this proposal we define three relevant target groups: students, graduates and teaching staff. During the project period of two years students and graduates will be sent abraod in small groups. The  students get the chance tomake contact with new cultures and its people. They can experience the differences between worklife in Germany and other countries.\r\nAt a later stage the department for vocational schools helps the EU-coordinators when it comes to submitting their own project proposals. We offer advice and organisational support. \r\nNext to this the vocational education staff (i.e. staff in charge of EU projects or staff from companies responsible for training) will have the opportunity to spend a work stay abroad in a European country. For improving the Europeanization of the Nuremberg vocational training system it is crucial to include this target group in the proposal. They can multiply their gained expereniences within their school/company.\r\nThe objective of each work stay varies, depending on the stage of the partnership between the vocational school in Nuremberg and the foreign partner. Major aims are:\r\n- Study stay to gain job-specific and expert experience .\r\n- Initiation of new contacts and agreements on details for possible new mobility projects. \r\n\r\nThe project implementation is launched by the Department for Vocational schools at the City of Nuremberg.
