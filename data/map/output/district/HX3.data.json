It is estimated that in the US ~$17 billion were spent annually treating sepsis in patients and a similar amount is spent across the EU. To reduce costs and provide better treatment to patients, early, accurate diagnosis is critically important.\n\nThe CE-microArray project will utilize existing technology from clinical chemistry, microplate readers and cavity enhanced spectroscopy in a truly novel way to develop more sensitive, accurate, faster and more useful diagnostic platform.\nThe project consortium comprises experienced SMEs from across Europe who have developed the concept but do not have the capability to undertake the required Research and Development to produce working prototypes in preparation for commercialization. To do this they require funding to pay third party R&D specialists to undertake the R&D.\nThe project aims to produce a solution based on colorimetric detection that will be up to 100 times more sensitive, reducing the damage to patients with sepsis, allow sensitive and accurate detection of an increased range of biomarkers at lower cost and higher throughput.

This comprises an analysis of the entire life cycle identify significant environmental and economic impacts and hence potential for improvement guaranteeing high product quality, as well as high product safety. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) allows to identify the crucial weak points in the life cycle and to assess improvement strategies to achieve an environmentally sensitive product design. LCA informs designers and developers concerning the implications of their choices on the environmental impacts and is therefore a decision-making tool. The innovative methodology faces the challenge to solve the paradox of textiles coverings: on the one hand the bonding of the multi layers has to be solid; on the other hand the multi layers have to be easy to dismantle for recycling. Applying this methodology a closed loop system of resources is realised, enabling material recycling. Re-design comprises not only optimisation of currently used material sets or manufacturing and distribution processes but also product and process innovations: It covers the development of innovative material adaptations as well as new approaches within the manufacturing process, recovery and reuse stage itself. The feasibility of the re-design concepts will be proven by producing prototypes of eco-designed textile floor coverings from the construction sector. The work will be completed by describing the methodology in a Code of Pratice which will be implemented in a customised, practical and intuitive software tool. The Ecodesign methodology will provide additionally a communication scheme for external communication based upon LCA results too.

The prospect of a technology enabling removal of pigments and selected additives from scrap opens up a range of possibilities in terms of quality of, and applications for recycled material. In addition, it would have a large impact on the need for virgin material and thus, raw material consumption. The overall technological aim of the project is the development of a controlled supercritical fluid extraction unit that quickly and efficiently removes pigments and selected additives from waste polyethylene. Among the drivers are European Commission directives such as 2004/12/EC Packaging and packaging waste, in addition to the strategy on prevention and recycling of waste. Today, China is a large player on the scrap market, buying enormous volumes. China has reduced imports of virgin resin by importing recycled and scrap polymer, increasing the amount of domestic recycling. China is the world\u2019s largest polyethylene customer, importing 5.65tonnes in 2005, which was well below expectations due to the imports of recycled and scrap polymer.
