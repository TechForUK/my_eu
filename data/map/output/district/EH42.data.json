It is also our objective that staff will have an opportunity to visit a French school and establish a link with that school which can be continued through a joint project via eTwinning in future.\r\n\r\nWe have a big and growing school with more than thirty classes.

The teachers will spend one week following intensive language and methodology lessons, learning about French culture and the French way of life, including the French school system. After classes they will participate in traditional French extra-curricular activities such as learning to play petanque, they will eat typical French meals and some teachers will have the opportunity to visit a French school, observe lessons and investigate the possibility of continuing a link via eTwinning to complete a joint project.\r\n\r\nWe envisage that this project will build on first steps our teachers have already begun to take to learn French. It will build teachers' confidence, enhance their teaching skills and also the school's focus on international links. It will impact on the whole school, staff and pupils, by bringing the teaching and learning of French to life through an integrated approach and real communication through a range of themes both within the classroom and around the rest of the school.\r\n\r\nIt will provide these teachers with enhanced opportunities for career development through on-going dissemination of good practice within the school and beyond in the Local Authority.
