High Energy Fluid Jets (HEFJet) processing is a niche technology with outstanding capabilities: cuts any material at negligible cutting forces; generates virtual zero heat; uses the abrasive jet plume as a \u201cuniversal tool\u201d. Nevertheless, freeform machining by High Energy Fluid Jets Milling (HEFJet_Mill) is still at infancy level. This is because no control solution for HEFJet_Mill exists.  ConforM-Jet will develop and demonstrate, for the fist time, a self-learning control system for HEFJet_Mill to generate freeform parts. This will be done by integrating models of HEFJet_Mill with patterns of multi-sensory signals to control the outcomes of jet plume \u2013 workpiece interaction, i.e. magnitude and shape of abraded footprint; these are key issues in controlling the generation of freeforms via HEFJet_Mill. This will be done via the following research steps: - Develop a novel integrative energy-based model of HEFJet_Mill. - Develop an innovative energy-based multi-sensing monitoring system for HEFJet_Mill. - Develop a radically new control system for HEFJet_Mill of freeforms that is equipped with novel abilities: Self-learning ability: Self-gauging of the energetic models of HEFJet_Mill vs. key energy-based sensory signals. Thus, whenever new working scenario occurs, updated models are employed by the model predictive controller. Self-adaptive ability: The energy-based sensory signals, trained with the data available in the process database, will be taught to respond to process variations by feeding back the correct combination of process parameters. - Demonstrate ConforM-Jet control strategy on multi-axis HEFJet_Mill systems to generate aerospace, medical, and optical freeform components made of difficult-to-cut materials (Ni/Ti alloys, optical glass).", 496006.0, 4334916.0, 5, 9, "CONFORM-JET", "http://www.conformjet.eu/", "http://www.zeeko.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/149755.jpg", "fp7_91317_995760000"], [1358208000000, 1468454400000, "Enabling advanced functionalities of Diamond and other ultra-hard materials by Integrated Pulsed Laser Ablation Technologies", "Zeeko Limited", "Diamond and other ultra-hard materials possess outstanding mechanical, wear and thermal properties that make them attractive to manufacture a wide range of high value-added products such as high-performance, smart tools. However, due to the extreme properties of this group of materials, efficient and precise generation of complex 3D freeform geometries and structures to meet the needs for a further development of high-performance tools is still a challenge. DIPLAT addresses the need for an efficient, precise and flexible processing technology for ultra-hard materials in tooling applications, in order to fully exploit the potential of these materials. By smartly utilizing the advantages of high brilliance short and ultra-short pulsed lasers, a tooling technology based on 3D Pulsed Laser Ablation (PLA) will be developed and demonstrated for various industrial applications. DIPLAT will introduce new technology platform for producing ultra-hard tools with enhanced functionality, outstanding machining performance and superior lift-time. In this regard, DIPLAT fosters the following four main scientific and technological objectives: (1) Design functional surfaces (with controlled micro geometries) on diamond and other ultra-hard materials to enable enhanced functionality for tooling applications; (2) Study and development of advanced 3D processing strategies for structuring/conditioning of ultra-hard tool surfaces and superabrasive grain layers by Pulsed Laser Ablation; (3) Develop and implement a novel multi-axis control concept and a model-based CAM software support module to enable optimized 3D pulsed laser processing; (4) Fabrication of various novel prototype tools made of ultra-hard materials and demonstration of their superior performance and functionality in challenging industrial applications.

The domestic sector is of major significance, as it will reduce reliance on large centralized energy plants. There are several domestic options including solar thermal, solar electric, heat pump and biomass systems. Of these, solar and heat pump technologies have the widest potential application as they require no physical feedstock. However, despite steady market growth, these technologies still make up only a small fraction of total household energy supply. One of the main reasons for this is the initial investment required, coupled with uncertainty over return on investment. This is compounded by the huge range of available products and a lack of objective information relating to system performance.  As a result, consumers are often confused and unable to make informed decisions. In addition, installation companies often experience difficulties when advising customers on the various options and their respective benefits. Hence, despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, there exists a significant knowledge and confidence barrier that restricts increased market acceptance.  In order to address this problem, we propose to develop a system that can automatically provide accurate and objective information about the suitability of a renewable energy technology for a given user scenario. The system will be intuitive and easy to use employing a unique dynamic grading technology.
