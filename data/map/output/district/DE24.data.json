This is not the case for Electromagnetic Compatibility between rail vehicle and installed track circuits, which represents one of the major cost drivers in the authorisation process. Indeed each country has developed its own requirements and assessment process \u2013 in many cases on an empirical basis and/or not even written down.\nThe EUREMCO objective is to harmonise and reduce the certification process of rail vehicle against Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).

For this purpose, a common understanding of transients \u2013 very short and very high interference currents \u2013and a harmonized test procedure will be also developed. By addressing also non electrified lines, the EUREMCO project will cover the whole European railway network.\nBy closing the corresponding \u201copen points\u201d in the TSIs, the EUREMCO project will lead to a time and cost reduction of the certification process of rail vehicle against Electromagnetic Compatibility issues, which correspond to an estimated saving of \u20ac60m for the next 15 years.", 147707.0, 3057274.0, "EUREMCO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.bombardier.com", null, "fp7_100605_998543512"], ["8AD", "INtegrated European Signalling System", "Bombardier Transportation Uk Ltd", "Due to the seamless guidance by rails, the railway system requires a dedicated signalling sub-system, whereby a major part of the functionality must be ensured and controlled on the infrastructure side.

Also the implementation of systems utilising centralised and automated route-setting of trains will be economically constrained.Railways are aiming for significantly reduced life-cycle costs of future interlocking and associated outdoor equipment. Standardisation, increased competitive tendering and significant reduction of implementation time are considered to be key requirements for the future.Without an approach, similar to that underway for ERTMS-ETCS, many suppliers will run into resource constraints, making it difficult for them to keep up with the many new concurrent developments.Therefore, railways and the signalling supply industry agree that the scope of INESS should be the interlocking up to the point of interfaces with the surrounding other signalling and train control systems like centralised traffic control, neighbouring interlocking, ETCS Radio-block centres and possibly object controllers for out-door devices.INESS will adopt the CENELEC norm with the underlying system engineering principles.

Together, key railway actors worked on articulating specifications for new interlocking systems and reducing the life-cycle cost (LCC) of signalling systems. The EU-funded project 'Integrated European signalling system' (INESS) took up the challenge to streamline railway operation, enhance safety and contribute to implementing the ERTMS.\n\nBuilding on the research of a similar previous project, EuroInterLocking, the project team mapped the value chain of interlocking systems and defined a new data model, including needed adaptations and applicability. It completed reports on a life-cycle\u2013based cost model for interlocking systems, market-specific cost drivers, and cost-saving potential within the interlocking life-cycle.\n\nIn terms of generic needs for new generation interlocking systems, the team mapped necessary requirements and interfaces to produce a strategy for verification and validation. It then studied safety constraints related to the interfaces and proposed one of several harmonised structures, outlining viable migration strategies to the new system.\n\nAmong the project's greatest achievements was defining how the system should be implemented. The new strategy was based on transferring relevant railway data to industry stakeholders in order to configure an INESS interlocking-specific application, a model dubbed European Unified Description of Railway Infrastructure (EUDRI). INESS also published a handbook on best practices for testing the interlocking system and developed an open source software support tool to reduce time and money in signalling while enhancing safety.\n\nAll these valuable initiatives and efforts have been detailed in around 100 deliverables that can be accessed on the project's website. In parallel, the International Union of Railways (UIC) produced a final technical report on the project's results and made it available to the public, paving the way for harmonised signalling and interlocking systems.

For example, a 10C uncertainty on turbine entry temperature changes the specific fuel consumption by 0.2%. Also a 0.2mm change in turbine tip clearance changes the specific fuel consumption by 0.4%.

Their low weight, along with their inherent resistance to corrosion and fatigue, enables more fuel efficient and sustainable transport structures. However, for many applications, the biggest factor currently preventing the more widespread use of light high-performance polymer matrix composites is their poor fire performance. This is due to the organic matrices, which first soften on heating, causing a loss of mechanical properties and then, at higher temperatures, decompose. Decomposition results in the production of smoke and toxic or flammable decomposition products. These products are not only hazardous in terms of lack of visibility and toxicity; they can also burn, releasing heat, which can lead to flame spread and exacerbate the fire. Furthermore, loaded composite structures often collapse in a fire within a period of minutes, depending on the magnitude of the load and heat flux. The overall aim of the project is to develop novel, cost-effective, high-performance, lightweight polymer matrix composites with a step-change improvement in fire behaviour. FIRE-RESIST will achieve this by carefully targeted research in five key areas: 1. Micro-layered structural materials that are designed to delaminate extensively when exposed to heat, thereby generating a multiplicity of internal interfaces that provide a fire barrier of exceptionally low thermal conductivity. 2.

Two promising epoxy resins were selected, manufactured and distributed to partners for the benchmarking process.

In 2008, Noel-Baker (via the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy) became one of the first institutions in the UK to deliver the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) framework on behalf of England Basketball. AASE is a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport by competing on the world stage or securing a professional contract. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy. Working with BC Ninane in Belgium, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Embedding LLP principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 24 (male and female) Apprentices undertaking the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy programme in the 2014/15 academic year (ie the 2013 and 2014 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their basketball ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at BC Ninane, including:\r\n\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n\r\n- Games versus high quality Belgian youth teams.\r\n\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBC Ninane has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable Noel-Baker to enhance the work placement activities of participants. For example:\r\n\r\n- Access to high quality local and regional basketball clubs with activities to include training sessions and games at world class training facilities.\r\n\r\n- A visit to the Royal Belgian Basketball Federation to undertake work shadowing, observe the professional practices and explore exit pathways.\r\n\r\n- Observation of a live Basketball League Belgium (BLB) Basketball game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoel-Baker will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.\r\n\r\n2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.\r\n\r\n3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.\r\n\r\n5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.\r\n\r\n6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.\r\n\r\n7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.\r\n\r\n8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n\r\n10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n\r\n- Achievement of recognised qualifications (e.g. BTEC L1 Work Skills). \r\n\r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impacts on Noel-Baker are expected to include:\r\n\r\n- Enhancement of the Basketball Academy programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. \r\n\r\n- Implementation of best practice across the Sports Academy programme and also the wider school.\r\n\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for students, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.noel-baker.derby.sch.uk", "Noel-Baker School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000329_coordinator"], ["8JE", "Support of Trainees leading to European Competences in Foreign Apprenticeship Systems", "Derby College", 134358.0, "The mobility projekt \"Support of trainees leading to European Competences in Foreign Apprenticeship system \" of vocational schools of the district of Osnabr\u00fcck Brinkstra\u00dfe has consistently developed .

As evidence of learning the participants will reflect on and document this process. The plan is for the trainees to be certified through the partner organizations, which will be recognized as part of their actual qualification.\r\nIn the \u201eLetter of Intent\u201c the cooperating partners agree that the hosting organizations will see to the logistical operations and aspects of the trainees' stay.  Questions as to the lodgings, communication with the internship businesses, transfer of tutoring services, and emergency procedures fall under the agreed-upon duties.  \r\nBSZW wants zu sign \"learning agreements\" with his partnerinstitutions to determine the role of each organisation to rule the planned mobilities. Learning agreements as an element of the ECVET-instruments serve to determine the attained learning outcomes achieved by the students during their mobilities. Stuff members of the BSZW contribute with their partnerinstitutions to the documentation, validation and acknowledement of achieved and proved competences of the students at the end of their mobilities and deliver the europass mobility.\r\nThe specific reconfiguration of the workprogram will be decided upon during the initial contact visits with the individual partnering institutions. The unified goal of all 6 partnering institutions aligns with the direction of using the ECVET-instruments and strives to reshape its ideas within the parameters of the European qualifications of career training.  Joint developmental work will be achieved, project goals and materials will be evaluated, and learning agreements or continued memorandums for a mutual agreement will be formulated. In addition, certificates and Euro-passports will also be obtained for the individual project participant.\r\nIt is expected that the participant will benefit from an increased intercultural competence. The trainees should dismantle their preconceived notions of various European cultures and accept and recognize them. The trainees are to become conscious of the fact that learning another language (mainly English) is crucial within the European business community. \r\nAnother useful point of this program is for the trainees to learn about specific work and operations-related procedures and to differentiate content learning within various businesses (eventually business sizes).  \r\nThe motivation of the returning participants should change the attitude and thinking of the previously unconvinced career training centers, with the hope of sending future trainees to mobile learning sites and hosting trainees from partnering countries.

This project also aims to improve the possibilities to enter the job market or to get a study placement for further studies. Participating into this project improves learners\u2019 capability to handle different kind of situations in life and interact with people from other cultures. Mobility period abroad also inspires participants to work or study in another EU country in the future.  \r\n \r\nThe objective of the staff mobility is to improve Omnia\u2019s personnel\u2019s internationalization competences.

As an important result of the project the guidance skills of the personnel improve, the roles of each staff group clear up and guidance will be part of daily teaching- and monitoring work. Teachers and guidance personnel also get to know and use the ECVET-documents provided by European Comission and are able to make personal plans for contents of each student\u2019s mobility period. The use of new social media enables more people to get to know about the results of the project.   \r\n\r\nParticipants represent different vocational fields. In this project there are 234 mobilities for students and freshly graduates and 42 for Omnia\u2019s staff from different vocational units. The age of the learners varies very much, but mostly all the students are in the final year of their studies. The aims and contents of all mobilities are planned individually. The duration of the mobility period can be from 14 days (group mobility) up to 100 days (individual work based learning). For the staff there are one and two weeks staff training and teaching assignment periods. \r\n\r\nAll participants prepare themselves before the mobility period. Omnia has developed a versatile preparation program including language and cultural preparation, guidance for practical matters and preparation of the documents, personal meetings with international coordinator and vocational guidance. Host partners help with the practical issues like accommodation and finding a work placement, give guidance in the work placement and evaluate the skills and competences. After the work based learning period the skills and competences will be recognized and validated as part of student\u2019s studies. \r\n\r\nIn the staff mobilities international coordinators and assistant help participants with the practical matters. The host partner helps to create suitable work program for each participant and is the contact person for the local companies and educational organisations. After the mobility participant disseminates the experiences and results in the home organization in team meetings. \r\n\r\nThere are several impacts in many different levels: student/freshly graduate, staff, organisation, capital area and international. \r\nThis project has big impact on students\u2019 and freshly graduates\u2019 working life and lifelong learning skills, and also on the possibilities to cope and further develop in the working life.

In 2008, Noel-Baker (via the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy) became one of the first institutions in the UK to deliver the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) framework on behalf of England Basketball. AASE is a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people who have the realistic potential to achieve excellence in their sport by competing on the world stage or securing a professional contract. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to further enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy. Working with BC Ninane in Belgium, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for students upon completion of the Academy programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing the students to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip students with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\nParticipants will be the circa 20 (male and female) Apprentices undertaking the Noel-Baker Basketball Academy programme in the 2015/16 academic year (i.e. the 2014 and 2015 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their basketball ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at BC Ninane, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n- Games versus high quality Belgian youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nBC Ninane has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable Noel-Baker to enhance the work placement activities of participants. For example:\r\n- Access to high quality local and regional basketball clubs with activities to include training sessions and games at world class training facilities.\r\n- A visit to the Royal Belgian Basketball Federation to undertake work shadowing, observe the professional practices and explore exit pathways.\r\n- Observation of a live Basketball League Belgium (BLB) Basketball game. \r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\nNoel-Baker will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.\r\n2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.\r\n3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.\r\n4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.\r\n5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.\r\n6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.\r\n7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.\r\n8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. \r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n- Achievement of recognised qualifications (e.g. BTEC L1 Work Skills). \r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\nThe impacts on Noel-Baker are expected to include:\r\n- Enhancement of the Basketball Academy programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of students and coaches, and also student achievement rates. \r\n- Implementation of best practice across the Academy programme and also the wider school.\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for students, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.noel-baker.derby.sch.uk", "Noel-Baker School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012958_coordinator"], ["8JE", "Improving the quality of traineeship", "Derby College", 233603.0, "Tartu Vocational Education Centre (TVEC) where 3500 students or approximately 14% of Estonian students learning a trade either after basic or secondary school attend studies on a daily basis, is the largest institution providing vocational education in Estonia. Due to the impressive number of students we have an influential role in Estonian economy which means a great deal of responsibility. The new law for vocational education schools in Estonia binds over output-oriented curricula, shortening the duration of studies, increasing the importance of practical work and the flexibility of studies. Companies expect us to teach modern skills and trades which more closely correspond with the needs of labor market today. In addition, vocational school leavers have to meet high requirements in the fields of  foreign languages and other key competences. The school plan for 2014-2018 in TVEC has been compiled taking into account the forementioned priorities including increasing the amount of practical studies, improving their quality, developing output-oriented curricula and professional skills of our teachers. In the current project the following ambitious objectives have been set: to considerably improve the quality of practical studies through learning mobility of 34 teachers (teachers of professional skills for trades and internship co-ordinators) which will bring modern competences and help them to be implemented at our school. We will be able to establish closer contacts with companies and the labor market which is of vital importance for a vocational school. An additional value to learning mobility will be internship curricula and their implementation plans for 10 specialties which will be the basis for recognizing the students` studies at the receiving partner in the framework of ECVET. Another important objective of the project is to reduce dropping out of school and further improve the reputation of vocational education (candidates are more aware of what they want to learn) and to raise learning motivation (practical and flexible studies, internship also in foreign countries). \r\nSatisfaction polls for the students of TVEC during the last five years have reported foreign internship as one the aspects that raises motivation and enhances satisfaction. By 2018 the number of students who have had their internship in a foreign country is supposed to  increase from the current 2,9% to 5%. \r\nTo achieve the aim altogether 180 mobilities will be organized during the project, including 146 students (from 28 specialties) and 34 teachers. In collaboration with international partners will be developed 10 output criteria of studies practical modules or full parts of the modules (achieved the learning outcomes + assessment). During teachers mobilities will be acquired knowledge and experiences how to find and choose suitable internship company, to make individual traineeship tasks, to instruct supervisors and to evaluate. During students mobility will be test in practice achieved knowledge and created practical modules. Students mobility will be recognised by ECVET principles.\r\nThe Project will be coordinated by the three members of TVEC project unit who will initiate project activities, appoint people who are responsible, supervise and check if the desired results are achieved. Special attention will be paid to all-around support when preparing and organising mobility (creating project teams, selecting applicants, supporting participants, arranging assessment, giving information, guaranteeing communication with departments and partners etc). \r\nAs a result of the project students learning motivation will be raised, pre-conditions for reducing dropping out will be created; organisation, supervision and assessment of practical studies will improve. The implementation plans for curricula that follow the principles of  ECVET will be developed and recognised as part of TVEC studies in the framework of the current project and in future. The long-term influence of the project will be the rise of  popularity of vocational education, raised competence of TVEC personnel which willenable them to prepare highly skilled professionals for labour market in cooperation with entrepreneurs.", "http://www.derby-college.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-EE01-KA102-013334_12"], ["8HG", "Learning for a Global Future", "InterCollege (UK) Ltd", 9174.0, "The need of developing the intercultural competences of individuals through adult education are twofold.

Building on our previous Leonado da Vinci Lifelong Learning mobility projects and Erasmus programmes, this project aims to develop participants as international professionals through specialised placement programmes in Denmark Estonia, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. This project will incorporate a range of vocational areas from Derby College's vast array of subject areas and acts as a positive promotion of the opportunities of vocational learning by encouraging participants to develop and acquire new skills and explore international work, training and enterprise opportunities. 120 learners and staff from Derby College will visit Denmark Estonia, Finland, Germany and Sweden, countries which they may not have had the opportunity to visit if not for this project.Typically, level 2 & 3 learners do not consider the opportunities to work or train abroad, especially Eastern and Northern Europe, or opportunities for self employment. This project will encourage participants to consider different progression opportunities by offering challenging and exciting, but safe work and training placement opportunities to a learner cohort which is normally reticent. Further barriers to workforce mobility will be removed by linguistic and cultural preparation and the acquisition of specific industry terminology during the placement period abroad.The project will provide enrichment for the employability unit of the participants' core learning aim and is a pedagogically sound vehicle for learning.  This is supported by specialist work placement opportunities that will provide a rich source of information, skills development and real work experiences. These experiences will enable learners to explore the different approaches to employment commerce and entrepreneurship in each country. This fits with overall strategy of active learning and development of employability and enterprise skills that is strongly embedded in the college's curriculum. The overarching unit fits well with the intention to promote enterprise and skilled employment through development of vocational skills and work and training placements.  This adds value to the participants vocational subject expertise and links this skill development to further opportunities for them by developing their enterprise skills. The opportunities to work aboard will further broaden learners horizons and instill new attitudes based on real work experiences. The project seeks to develop expertise in the specialist area and complement the particpants' knowledge with more technical and practical training. One example is work shadowing in spas which is available during the Estonia visit. It is believed that the acquirement of these skills, not yet available to  our UK learners, will greatly increase the participating learners\u2019 chance of finding a job and being successful at work as these can be used immediately after the end of international placement, either in an employed or self-employed role.The participating staff will have an opportunity to tour the partner institution, to include observations of lessons taking place, to shadow an advance practitioner of partner institution, observe a range of teaching and learning activities, coaching and feedback sessions and team teach, if desired. The outcomes of the project are disseminated and used to facilitate the adoption of any best practices that are identified as a result of the project activities.  Participation in this project results in the College adopting a new technique or assessment practice, or questioning strategy as observed as part of the European visit, and putting it into practice.

Each partner will be expected to select and nominate two members of their organization to the UNA for final selection.A2 \u2013 Training courseFor the training course in Moldova, the participants will be youth leaders, preferably with experience within the field of human rights and human rights education. The youth leaders will have an interest in further extending their knowledge regarding the topic and gain new tools and best practices in promoting human rights and active participation among young people.The partners will select and nominate their participants from their organizations and networks. Once they are selected, the potential participants will fill out an application form with their personal and professional information which will be overviewed by the project manager appointed by UNA. The final selection and confirmation of the participants will be made by UNA, together with the team of trainers/facilitators.In the long term, as a result of the project, the European community will become stronger, as people realize their own role in the shaping of society and become more sensitive toward each other. Members of the communities will start to take responsibility for each other, pay more attention and take the right steps whenever they will see a need.Their enhanced awareness of the importance of human rights and its protection will bring about a decrease in human rights violations in general and a more tolerant population of Europe. The recent refugee crises has shown that it is of utmost importance to educate the citizens of the European Union on acceptance and equal rights.", "http://www.intercollege.info", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA105-022030_1"], ["8JE", "European Classmates Benefit from Mobilities for Vocational Education and Training III", "Derby College", 31100.0, "We are planning to send 22 trainees and 6 members of the educational staff to 6 different partnerships to participate in 8 different courses of study.  As most of the mobility partnerships are relatively known institutions, except the French partner organisation, the number of staff member mobilities could be reduced a bit in favour of VET-learners mobilities. They are nevertheless still necessary to maintain and strengthen contacts, introduce new staff members or new courses of study into the cooperation. Additionally, BSZW wants to be able to send the development staff to its partner organisations repeatedly, for several days each time, to smoothly and effectively plan and coordinate the main activities of the exchange as well as for job-shadowing purposes.\r\nThe initial goal, according to the school's and this program's mission, is to be able to globalize all course offerings at the BSZW. It is of the utmost importance to expand foreign language education in a unified Europe where workers have the freedom to live and work where they choose. The creation of a shared European learning space will be defined by the partnership with the help of reference work processes called  \u201eWork Units\"/\"Mobility Units\"/\u201cActivity Units\". In the end these will serve as measurable and examinable evidences of learning of our mobility abroad and are a portion of an externally-obtained (degree) qualifcation. \r\nIn order to suitably represent Germany in Europe interested participants, at least aged 18, will be chosen based on their independence, flexibility, adaptability, and willingness to learn. \r\nThe experience of the participants, in conjunction with the local training and work, is the main focus of this program. As evidence of learning the participants will reflect on and document this process. The plan is for the trainees to be certified through the partner organizations, which will be recognized as part of their actual qualification.\r\nIn the \u201eLetter of Intent\u201c the cooperating partners agree that the hosting organizations will see to the logistical operations and aspects of the trainees' stay.  Questions as to the lodgings, communication with the internship businesses, transfer of tutoring services, and emergency procedures fall under the agreed-upon duties.  \r\nBSZW wants zu sign \"learning agreements\" with his partnerinstitutions to determine the role of each organisation to rule the planned mobilities. Learning agreements as an element of the ECVET-instruments serve to determine the attained learning outcomes achieved by the students during their mobilities. Stuff members of the BSZW contribute with their partnerinstitutions to the documentation, validation and acknowledement of achieved and proved competences of the students at the end of their mobilities and deliver the europass mobility.\r\nThe specific reconfiguration of the workprogram will be decided upon during the initial contact visits with the individual partnering institutions. The unified goal of all 6 partnering institutions aligns with the direction of using the ECVET-instruments and strives to reshape its ideas within the parameters of the European qualifications of career training.  Joint developmental work will be achieved, project goals and materials will be evaluated, and learning agreements or continued memorandums for a mutual agreement will be formulated. In addition, certificates and Euro-passports will also be obtained for the individual project participant.\r\nIt is expected that the participant will benefit from an increased intercultural competence. The trainees should dismantle their preconceived notions of various European cultures and accept and recognize them. The trainees are to become conscious of the fact that learning another language (mainly English) is crucial within the European business community. \r\nAnother useful point of this program is for the trainees to learn about specific work and operations-related procedures and to differentiate content learning within various businesses (eventually business sizes).  \r\nThe motivation of the returning participants should change the attitude and thinking of the previously unconvinced career training centers, with the hope of sending future trainees to mobile learning sites and hosting trainees from partnering countries. The end result is a more positive view of the exchange program. Through a participation in the exchange the businesses strengthen their position in the workforce.
