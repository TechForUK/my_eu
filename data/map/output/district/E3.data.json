A group of pupils in the school are so called \"euro - orphans\", a number of the parents are unemployed while teachers are far away from the academic centres. Therefore, our school is searching for innovative ways of imroving its education for the sake of the pupils. After the educational reform, we are facing a new challange - the education of 5 and 6 year olds. Coping with young children requires an adequate approach. Our teaching staff is experiencing some difficulties with that. We need new forms and methods of work. English teachers are not prepared to work with children. Moreover, they have limited contact with the real language, they do not go abroad, which prevents them from improving their accent, developing their speaking skills. The teachers of other subjects are not fluent in foreign languages, either. It impedes them from using modern technology (eTwinning, the internet), exchanging experiences and reaching the European level. They are not prepared to travel abroad. What is more, teachers are reluctant to use the ICT. \r\nWe would like to educate our pupils as Europeans. We are searching for new solutions in this respect. The actions of this project are addressed to the English teachers and the teachers who teach other subjects to the children, from the kindergarten to the primary school. The implementation of this project is another step of our teachers towards the professional development. In order to prepare themselves for the mobility, the participants are going to improve their language skills, learn about the eduaction, culture and history of Ireland and Great Britain. During the mobility, we are going to learn new forms & methods of work. We are going to observe how ICT is used in practise and improve our language skills. In addition, we are going to share our experience with the teachers from our partner school. After our return, we are going to improve our teaching skills and share our experiences with other teachers and parents of our region. Our teachers are not going to be afraid of ICT any more. The contacts with other EU countries are going to give our school the European dimension. \r\nWe are planning to organize 2 mobilities:\r\nA1. Four English teachers are going to attend teaching young children methodology course in SWAN Training Institute in Dublin from 14 - 21.02.2016, which is our winter break. We are going to learn how to teach 5 to 10 year olds and how teachers from other countries (present at the course) deal with that. We are going to improve our language skills through immersion. We are going to establish contact with different foreign teacher and use eTwinning for our actions. \r\nA2.

We are going to have meetings with the partner teachers, shadow their classes, learn about the ways of motivating, methods and forms used by them while teaching, learn about the procedures used to solve pupils' problems with learing, behaviour, developmental & social deficits.

They are not able to confidently consolidate and extend pupils learning with any follow-up activities. With the time constraints of only one French specialist teacher, French is also limited to Key Stage 2. As the school continues to expand to a 3 form entry school over the next 4 years, this limitation will become even more apparent and there will be a deficit in staff capacity to teach French.\r\n  Our objective is to upskill tour eachers and teaching assistants to support the delivery of the French curriculum across the school. From September 2017, we will extend the curriculum to cover KS1 classes and our 2 year project is focused on  staff undertaking training  in France to support this. We have identified 5 staff members to participate in this project based on factors including individual  linguistic skills, motivation to develop their skills, their role within the school and in the expansion of the languages provision to meet increased pupil numbers. The MFL coordinator had a crucial role in this selection process with the oversight of  senior leaders.\r\n  The participating teachers will carry out 2 mobilities--one each year.

There are 5 flows to Italy and 3 to the UK because the profile of the partners as well as the different geographical areas of them will enable the students to carry out their work. training in different fields since companies, even if they are from the same sectors, are very different.\r\n\r\nThe main OBJECTIVE of the project is:\r\nTo allow VET students to develop, through training practices in European companies, the skills and abilities to complete, in a practical way, the skills acquired in VET to be incorporated efficiently into the  European labor market, either on account own or for others. To do this, VET students needs to develop specific tecnical skills on the specialty that they has studied, but transversal, social and intercultural skills will also be necessary to face new challenges and become active citizens with values for the future.\r\n\r\nThe main ACTIVITIES  will be carried out are:\r\n- PREPARATION of the motilities: selection of the participants, initial evaluation of their competences, pre-departure training of participants, logistics and agreements\u2019 tasks definition, coordination, etc.\r\n- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY. Implementing the internship programs in the companies. The mobility also includes cultural activities.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PARTICIPANTS. The competences that will be acquired during the stay abroad will be evaluated according to the ECVET system and will be previously set, during the initial evaluation. All the internship activities will be planned to achieve these competences and will be customized.\r\n- MONITORING. The development of the internships will be monitored by all the tools and processes, previously agreed by the project.\r\n- EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT. \r\n- DISSEMINATION. The dissemination activities will be carried out in all project\u2019s phases. A final conference for the dissemination of the project\u2019s results will be organized. Besides the impact on the participants, the project will benefit all partners, fostering the European cooperation and relationships between companies and educational centres.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION activities and the mobility itself will generate an IMPACT at local, regional and national level. \r\n\r\nThe IMPACT of the project will be:\r\nThe project will improve the opportunities for VET students to be actively incorporate national or European labor market, either on their own account or as an employee, in a more effective way\r\nThe collaboration between the participating organizations will allow promoting European cooperation and internationalization and it will make it possible to bring companies closer to VET schools and it will improve too the collaboration with other VET schools, public authotities, etc. It will give participating entities a vision about most demanded professional profiles and the skills that students must learn\r\n\r\nThe project is directly linked to the 2020 strategy, the skills agenda and the European priorities  to help the EU and its Member States generate a higher level of employment, productivity ,social cohesion and development.", "http://www.itsdes.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA102-048381_18"], ["2AD", "Phoenix/Motylek Schools Strategic Partnership", "Phoenix School", 77035.0, "The project was conceived following successful visits from the partner school, visiting educational settings in London on the first occasion and then a longer visit to the applicant school over a period of 5 days.
