By integrating these new, innovative process steps with full automation in -nowadays mostly manually performed- complex handling operations, it will be possible to obtain a fully automated and highly adaptable manufacturing chain. 3D-LightTrans will open the way to a totally new concept for the design, manufacturing and application of composites for low-cost mass products in a wide range of sectors.\nThe Consortium brings together multidisciplinary research teams involving five industrial stakeholders from machine tools and machine automation (P-D Glasseiden, Van de Wiele, Lindauer Dornier, Coatema) and several OEM active in the field of processing of flexible materials and composite manufacturing, including Federal Mogul, among others, as well as from the application sector (FIAT and Bentley), and extensive expertise from well known research specialists in the area of materials, production research and technical textiles in particular, like AIT, TU-Dresden and University of Ghent.", 99217.0, 6482506.0, "3D-LIGHTTRANS", "Fibrous fabrics reinforce plastics", "Textile-reinforced polymer composites (TRPCs) could provide even more benefits than simpler fibre-reinforced ones. Comprehensive and cost-effective technology covering the entire production chain could expand markets from niche to mass production.", "Advanced polymer composites such as reinforced plastics combine the light weight and low cost of a polymer matrix with the superior properties of the reinforcing fibres embedded in it. When these fibres are woven to create fabrics, even more benefits can be expected. However, widespread commercial application has so far been hindered, largely due to processing difficulties and their inherently high costs.\n\nThe EU-funded 'Large scale manufacturing technology for high-performance lightweight 3D multifunctional composites' (http://www.3d-lighttrans.com/ (3D-LIGHTTRANS)) project is overcoming these limitations. A highly flexible manufacturing chain for low-cost production of high-performance 3D TRPCs will open new markets beyond aeronautics. Targets include transportation, health, energy, leisure and other important sectors.\n\nConsortium members are exploiting individual processes developed by partners. Multi-material semi-finished fabrics made of hybrid yarn are formed into draped, pre-fixed multi-layered and multifunctional 3D textile preforms. Thermoforming then creates the final composite part from those. Integration of the steps into a complete and automated process chain will pave the way to an entirely new concept for low-cost, mass production of TRPCs and applications.\n\nTwo demonstration parts, a wheel well and a tailgate, are being produced for the automotive industry from polyethylene terephthalate and glass fibre reinforcement. Extensive modelling of the 3D-LIGHTTRANS composites is supporting the work.\n\nProduction of hybrid yarns by the air mingling process is progressing. A multi-layer fabric has been developed according to demonstrator requirements and 120\u00a0m of it was produced on a newly modified partner loom for manufacturing of the demonstrators. The team is investigating sewing and bonding to increase width greater than that accommodated by the loom. This will provide important insight into such capabilities.\n\nRobotics capabilities for handling the fabrics are in place for scale-up of mass production. Manufacture of the demonstrators is underway and first data have been obtained on scale-up. A single piece takes approximately 35 minutes to produce.\n\nUsing lightweight materials will result in significant savings in fuel consumption, translating to both financial benefits for the consumer and reduced carbon dioxide emissions.

All projects aim at helping small VET schools which lack the means or the experience to put forward an individual mobility project to take part in an Erasmus + KA1 VET project. The Consortium is coordinated by the Department for Education of the Balearic Islands, being the following its main responsibilities: \r\n-Financial, administrative and contract management\r\n-Create contacts\r\n-Assessment, results analysis, widespread dissemination\r\n\r\n36 out of the 66 formal VET schools and 1 of the 2 art schools which offer Intermediate VET are an integral part of this Consortium. It is made up of 23 VET programmes belonging to 18 vocational fields.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at meeting the needs of its members, in particular:\r\n-Modernize the schools and boost the appeal and quality of their Intermediate VET \r\n-Acquire the necessary skills to implement the dual learning apprenticeship model\r\n-Initiate or consolidate internationalization \r\n-Incorporate the European dimension in the curriculum\r\n-Improve the participant\u2019s global competences \r\n-Ameliorate key competences in students and boost professional competence in teachers.\r\n\r\nThese needs would translate into the following project objectives:  Contribute to lowering school drop out rates. Diversify the educational offering of the dual learning apprenticeship model. Give educational institutions a global dimension while fostering transnational mobility. Raise employability of Intermediate VET graduates and increase the number of students going on to study Higher VET.\r\n\r\nWith a means to achieve these objectives, two types of mobilities are being considered:\r\n- Mobility of 74 students to take their 5 week on-the-job training in companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Finland \r\n- Mobility of 44 CFGM teachers and members of the Department for Education, with a view to do job shadowing for the dual learning apprenticeship model in Germany the United Kingdom and Findland.\r\n \r\nIn order to make these mobilities a reality, there are 11 European VET shools acting as partners, all of them of considerable size, with international experience and most of them with previous experience of cooperation with the Department for Education. Agreements are celebrated for the exchange of teachers and students. The latter will be sent for internships to the companies with which agreements have been entered. The students will be also mentored by the VET institutions at their destination. The cooperation consists of visits, phone calls and emails.\r\n\r\nParticipants are selected at each educational institution, following a call and based on specific common criteria. Each school takes care of preparing for the visit on different dimensions: pedagogical, cultural, health and safety, trips, protection, etc. This preparation can also be done in cooperation with other schools be it a face to face cooperation or via the Moodle platform created to this effect. The students use the OLS and specific language courses,  and an online course is created for the staff at the Department for education.
