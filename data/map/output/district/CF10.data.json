The proposed integrated concept will be first modelled and simulated for different typologies of buildings and water distribution network, then tested at an intermediate level in a full-scale experimental facility in France (AQUASIM) before being finally installed, monitored and evaluated in two pilot projects (including residential and non residential buildings) in the UK (Cardiff - Wales) and Italy (La Spezia).<br/>These demonstrators will be used to assess the societal, environmental and economic benefits of the new integrated concept and also to validate models and technologies in order for the concept to be easily replicable throughout all countries and differing European areas.

The participants will come from a range of backgrounds (NEET, homelessness, social isolation, family breakdown, health problems) but the common factor is a low level of self-confidence which has a big impact on their (in)ability to see opportunities as being within their reach.

The volunteering is central to all the activities and enables the group to achieve visible results with a high level of satisfaction and accomplishment.

This will enable them to develop their skills and experiences in teamwork; intercultural communication; problem solving and dealing with conflict; expressing ideas and influencing others; practical working skills; language awareness/acquisition; planning and preparation; budget management and fundraising. These skills/experiences will lead to enhanced emotional competences which young adults need in order to make positive and successful life choices: a \u2018can-do\u2019 approach; increased self-belief and motivation; ability to build new relationships; empathy with and understanding of others and an understanding and appreciation of diversity.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Step Up To Change, 30 young people with fewer opportunities from across Wales will have widened their base of skills and experiences, and will have increased confidence to change their situations.

The growing need for more relevant and competent professional expertise, changes in demographics, and increased globalisation all require new and innovative professional competences and relevant vocational education and training. International cooperation is an integral part of the Hordaland County Council\u2019s (HCC) strategy for regional development. The strategy aims to create a sustainable, attractive and competitive region, and give young people international competence, experience and shared responsibility. As these challenges are not only valid for Hordaland, the HCC see international cooperation as a tool to finding possible solutions to such challenges. The HCC is therefore using participation in different European mobility programmes, such as Erasmus+ VET mobility, as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting the needs for more relevant professional expertise and pedagogical knowledge, international experience, as well as improved foreign language competences and enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\nAs part of the HCC\u2019s strategic plans for internationalisation, international cooperation is to be an integrated part of education and training, as it adds value and quality to the training of professionals. International competences offer VET learners the opportunity to develop their abilities to actively participate in an increasing multicultural society and global world. To achieve these goals, it is an important task of the HCC to mobilise VET schools and training agencies to participate in European mobility programmes. As a regional developer, the HCC also encourage staff in public offices, enterprises and other relevant organisations to improve and strengthen their professional skills within their field of expertise, as well as developing intercultural competence and knowledge. \r\nThe target groups for this mobility project are VET learners, VET staff and other staff in institutions where training is offered. A large portion of the staff mobility projects consists of interdisciplinary groups where at least one of the participants is representing a VET organisation.

In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as health promoting work in schools, welfare technology, civil entrepreneurship, broader understanding of practices and systems in VET, as well as cooperation between VET and enterprises. \r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to strengthen the region through the acquisition of professional knowledge and expertise, develop new skills and competences, to develop prosperous local communities, improve learning outcomes for VET learners, increase recruitment and the number of VET learners finishing with a trade certificate. In addition to professional competences, it is expected that the project will increase foreign language and intercultural competences, as well as motivate participants to take part in and develop other international projects in the future.

It will make it possible to implement and disseminate new and innovative tools and methods to a wide variety of relevant stakeholders. It will also strengthen the quality of education and training, and the region will be able to offer activities and programmes that better respond to the needs of both the individual and the region.

The main establishment is a museum that is also named Jamtli and has approx. 200 000 visits every year. There is an indoor museum with exhibitions and a big open air museum with old buildings, parks, and animals - for example horses, cows and sheep.  In the summer the outdoor museum is transformed into a successful theme park, where the old buildings are animated with actors who roleplay through first person interpretation the actual people who have lived in the houses.  The roleplay is Jamtli\u00b4s signature method for learning for  the school programmes and familiy activities throughout the year.  Jamtli also runs historical farming, has a large collection of historical items, arts and photographs. Jamtli  Foundation also provides the services of building curators and archaeologists  and is the general owner of three joint-stock companies based on cultural heritage in other parts of the Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen. The Foundation is also general owner of NCK, The Nordic Centre for Heritage Learning and Creativity, their remit is research on cultural heritage activities across Europe.\r\n\r\nFor about a decade, there has been contacts between Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen and Welsh Government and also between the museum organisations in the regions.  Through this relationship it became apparent that we could learn a lot from each organisation and this led to the idea of a mobility pilot project between the two regions.  A Memorandum of Understanding was signed and National Museum Wales and Jamtli Foundation agreed to send staff on job shadowing and exchanges for five years.   With this project, Sharing and Learning, we are applying for funding support for the first two years of staff exchanges. Our focus is on increasing the number of learning experiences and opportunities within our two museums.\r\nIn both museum organisations, there are occupational groups that traditionally don\u00b4t work with learning. It\u00b4s groups like receptionists, janitors and household technicians, people who work with the collections, animal keepers, photographers and marketing staff.  However these groups do have contact with the visitors, and we would like to make better use of those contacts. Through job shadowing we want to make it possible for Jamtli staff to visit colleagues at National Museum Wales and identify a number of situations where they actually meet and interact with visitors. How can they transform these moments, that may be limited to a tender stroke of a horseneck or a brief question about where the nearest park bench is into a learning situation?\r\n\r\nDuring the project time of 24 months we want to perform 15 mobilities at four different occasions, with the occupational groups mentioned above.  We want the line manager closest to the employees , together with the leader of the project, to decide which employees could be most adequate for a staff exchange.  We would contact the National Museum Wales at least four months in advance of a proposed visit and they let Jamtli know if they can welcome colleauges at the proposed date. Then the employees make contact with eachother by e-mail or phone, and raise common questions. What kind of opportunities with visitors will be available?\r\n\r\nDuring the visit, the Jamtli staff write a diary and also follow up on the common questions. Together, the staff from Wales and J\u00e4mtland discuss how meetings with visitors can be transformed into learning situations. How can the tasks be communicated to different groups of visitors - children, old, disabled, people who speak another language? Can you invite visitors to take part in the work tasks? When the staff returns home, they go through the diaries with their line manager, a learning officer and the project leader. Together they agree upon a few learning activities that can be tested at Jamtli.  These test activities will be evaluated within 2-3 months and if the results are good, the activity will become a permanent learning activity and part of our programme.  The results of the exchange will also become a part of a report and a presentation given of the project. The presentation is published on Jamtli\u00b4s website and is also presented to Region J\u00e4mtland H\u00e4rjedalen and the owners of NCK.\r\n\r\nThere are several impacts and long term benefits of the project. The most important effect is that learning become a vital part of other museum departments not only of the learning department. The visitor should not be forced to take a guided tour to come across new knowledge - the learning should be found all over the museum, and every employee should be able to feel self secure, proud and happy to share his or her knowledge with others. Another effect of the project is that the pedagogical focus of National Museum Wales and Jamtli Foundation will make the two institutions more well-known, which will lead to more visitors and through that - more learning.", "http://www.museumwales.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA104-012003_1"], ["3NP", "Sharing and Learning", "National Museum Wales", 15534.0, "National Museum Wales consists of National Museum Cardiff, St Fagans National History Museum, the National Slate Museum, the National Wool museum, the National Roman Legion Museum, Big Pit National Coal Museum, the National Waterfront Museum and the National Collections Centre. These 8 are across wales and the collections cover earth and natural sciences, fine and applied art and the archaeology, industrial and social history of Wales. Our aim is to be a world class museum of learning. We have over 1.5 million visitors a year with 435,000 learners.\r\n\r\nSt Fagans National History Museum combines on one site functions which are generally delivered by separate institutions: the cultural learning experiences of a heritage site, an open-air museum of translocated historic buildings, gallery exhibitions, as well as the national archive of Welsh oral testimony. Over the next decade, the aim is to make St Fagans the most important centre for the enjoyment, understanding and study of the lives of peoples of Wales, from prehistory to the present day. The fundamental aim is to become a participatory museum which will allow us to get better the more people get involved.\r\n\r\nSt Fagans has established a partnership with Jamtli Foundation in Sweden, which similarly to St Fagans, is an open air museum with historic buildings and exhibitions as well as livestock. During the busy summer months Jamtli transform the site into a 'theme park' where 'actors' animate each building bringing them to life. St Fagans recognise that this process of operating in different modes is one from which we can learn. A Memorandum of Understanding has been drawn up between the two organisations and a  programme of job shadowing staff exchanges has been committed to.\r\n\r\nBoth organisations recognise that traditionally non learning focused roles can in fact provide a rich learning experience to the visitor. For example rather than closing an historic building for cleaning it may be possible to keep the building open so the visitor can observe the cleaning process. The member of staff can engage with the visitor explaining the task which they are undertaking. This is a learning experience which may be of interest and enriching to the visitor, but which at present is not available. Through the process of considering what staff roles may be able to interact with the public, to share their experiences in a coherent learning focused way,  it is imperative to consider the skills that the staff member may have. For example the cleaner, whilst confident in their abilities in the duties, may feel less confident relaying the importance of the task to the general public. \r\n\r\nThis process of understanding that all members of staff are able to engage with the visitor and increase their learning and awareness has lead to the Sharing and Learning project. Both organisations recognise that some staff will need to be upskilled to have the confidence to share their work duties and their importance with the visitors. The establishment of a job shadowing exchange project will boost the confidence of participants and enthuse them to consider how they can incorporate learning elements into various aspects of the work. This confidence and enthusiasm will cascade through the organisation as they consider potential development opportunities to provide excellent learner engagements.\r\n\r\nSt Fagans National History Museum and Jamtli Foundation are seeking funding for the Sharing and Learning project which will allow 15 staff members from Wales to visit Sweden, during 4 visits, over the course of 2 years.

The four partners share several commonfeatures: they all met during a contact making seminar held in December 2014, they are all partners from the same network (ALLIANCE) and  live in countries where the balance between national and regional identities is often at the center of public debate: It feels like this is an ongoing issue in Belgium, where Flanders and Wallonia are constantly struggling to find political and economical balance, in the UK, where a referendum for the independence of Scotland took place last year and there is a significant voice for independence in Wales, and in Spain, where the central government had to deal with regional demands for the longest time. Montenegro went a step further since the country won its independance from Serbia in 2006.\r\nAs youth workers, we are confronted with the issue of how the youngsters we work with will define themselves (that is, what is their identity) ans where they belong (that is, what is their community). It is understandable that youngsters are even more confused when facing these questions. They are still constructing their identity and they are still looking for references in order to do so. But what happens when the references are not as clear as they used to be? What if youngsters have so many options to choose from that eventually they decided not to choose any?\r\nThis is the starting point of this youth exchange. Through this project, we aim to explore the concepts of identity, community, intercultural awareness, citizenship and boundaries through the idea of \"home\". We'll support youngsters in sharing their points of view and experiences around the following questions: where do youngsters feel safe? where are their roots? How do I define myself? How do I define my community? Which community do I belong to?\r\nThe exchange will take place in the village of Borreda (near Barcelona, Spain).

To reach this change in our own country, we need strong leaders and entrepreneurs who stimulate sustainable development in both the North and the South. In September 2014 CATAPA, together with Mediaraven, Putumayo and Act 4 Change, have started a new campaign named \u2018Generation Transition\u2019. The aim of this campaign is to offer the new generation or 'Generation Transition' (managers, leaders, politicians, CEO\u2019s, teachers etc) skills and tools on sustainable development, in order to make the transition towards a society that uses resources in a sustainable manner.

The young people live, work and spend their freetime together, enabling an intensive exchange of cultures and life experiences. This provides a safe, structured and supportive environment for all participants, one in which the wellbeing of our young people is assured.The project will provide group volunteering activities for young people who face one or more of the seven Erasmus+ Inclusion & Diversity strategy obstacles, and will also have in common a lack of family support and low levels of self-confidence. The issues they face have a significant impact on their (in)abilities to see opportunities as being within their reach so the potential gains of participation are huge. With careful and structured support a young person who completes a period of volunteering abroad will achieve an accelerated personal development that raises their sense of self-worth and confidence. The activities in which the young people will participate are structured to respond to the needs, interests and strengths of those who take part.

A network of local partners in Wales enables us to reach young people, and to provide two layers of support especially in the preparatory and follow-up phases. We have selected our seven strongest European partners who, from experience, we know to approach youth inclusion in the same way as UNA Exchange and whom we can trust to fully support our young people. These partners also prioritise the inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities and are being invited to send their young people to our activities in Wales through a parallel project (\u201cGam wrth gam i Gymru\u201d). These relationships involve strong mechanisms (preparation, training, mentoring, follow-up) which enable the young people to achieve their goals.Participation in the project will involve young people contributing to and taking active roles in ways which they may not yet have experienced; decision making; expressing opinions and being listened to; having a purpose/goals; enjoyment and achievement; meeting & overcoming challenges and self-management. This will enable them to develop their skills and experiences in teamwork; intercultural communication; problem solving and dealing with conflict; expressing ideas; influencing others; practical working skills; language awareness; planning and preparation. These experiences will lead to enhanced maturity and resilience: a \u2018can-do\u2019 approach; increased self-belief and motivation; abilities to build new relationships; empathy with and understanding of others and an appreciation of diversity. This experiential form of learning is especially well suited to our target group.As a result of the project, participants will have widened their base of skills and experiences, and have increased confidence. They will make more active and positive contributions to their home communities (eg. work, training, participation). We expect further involvement from approximately half the group, continuing their roles as active citizens. It is part of a long-term process that over 2-3 years of involvement in positive activities at home and abroad, with sustained support from workers and UNA Exchange, young people with fewer opportunities can gain a stability and sense of purpose that enables them to move forward in their lives.The intercultural nature of the project will positively impact on participants attitudes to diversity in their home communities.

This is mainly due to the diversity of the adult learning sector and the diversity of the professional pathways to becoming an adult learning professional. The need for the safeguarding and improvement of the professional quality of Learning Facilitators in Adult and Continuing Education (ACE) is ongoing as the demands of the society change rapidly along with its demographics. Adult learning staff have a key role in facilitating lifelong learning experiences and thus, their professional development is one of the vital measures to improve quality of adult learning. As competences are context bound, it is therefore necessary to take the context in which professionals are working into account.The Lifelong learning at Open Air Museums: Improving Competences of Adult Learning Facilitators at European Open Air Museums (LOAM) project addresses adult learning and competences development for museum personnel at four Open Air museums in Sweden. It unfolds in a systematic attempt to explore how museums can become better adult learning providers and facilitators, and how can we ensure high quality provision? How to address better the diverse range of adults we receive nowadays? How to become and remain relevant to these adults?In collaboration with three receiving organisations in the UK and Norway, LOAM will give the opportunity to 24 participants from Sweden to meet staff who are involved in similar activities but in a different context. Through the collaboration and exchange of practices, knowledge and skills among the partners, LOAM aims at improving the competences of adult learning facilitators at six open air museums in three European countries. Each partner is carefully selected on the basis of the competences and services that they have developed through the years. All four Swedish museums are members of the Swedish Association of Open Air museums, and have longstanding commitment and collaboration with each other. Each organisation has specific competences that will benefit the work carried out by the rest of the partner organisations. The aim of the project is to initiate a process of continuous professional development for museum staff by joining up eight partners in three countries that contribute to lifelong and informal learning. The project will provide opportunities to share skills, approaches and expertise between these adult learning providers and thus, cement a truly joined-up lifelong learning movement. The key aim of the project is for staff members from all participating museums to improve competences on how to reach audiences based on the specific competences of the staff in for example crafts or farming.Colleagues from all partners together will hone their competences and develop their skills and knowledge. The insight and lessons learned will inform best practice guidelines for reaching and facilitating adult audiences. There could be a final course in Norway for two days during which the participants from Sweden will be instructed by NCK into using the Generic Learning Outcomes (GLOs) to assess their learning outcomes. The Generic Learning Outcomes are underpinned by a broad definition of learning which identifies benefits that people gain from interacting with arts and cultural organisations.The project develops within two years and includes both job shadowing, and a structured course in Trondheim, Norway.

The partners (both sending and receiving) will identify the key areas of expertise and the members of staff responsible for carrying these out. The line manager together with the leader of the project will decide which employees will be selected after inviting them to express interest in mobilities. The selections will be in line with the area of expertise of the receiving organisations. Negotiations and practical arrangements will be finalised at least four months in advance of a proposed activity. All participants will compile a written report before, during and after their participation.   It would be essential that participants learn together and that for example the Swedish participants offer to disseminate the results to colleagues from other open air museums in Sweden.

The volunteers will learn  skills, attitude and knowledge necessary for animal caretaking, but also gain general life, social and intercultural experience. As most of them have background or career plans involving animals, it's likely that their EVS-experience at AAP or Primadomus improves their chances on the labor market.

As we have become clearer about what it really takes for young people to be the bearers of prosperity of the EU, it is more evident that strategies to improve youth outreach need to focus on strengthening safe environments, not just on changing individual youth.

The project involves more than 100 youngsters from Belgium, Austria, Italy, Turkey, FYRoM, Portugal, Greece,  Poland, UK, Lithuania and Cyprus. Activities will take place between May and December 2016. YEU is an international network born in 1986 with the aim of bringing young people together from all over Europe and to build peace, understanding, European citizenship and a common sense of belonging. These ideas and values, however, seem to strike with today's feelings and situation in Europe. Current social changes brought both more opportunities and more risks and constraints for all European citizens, above all for young people. In this unique period in Europe, young people (and society in general) have to face a great number of issues: youth unemployment rates in EU are generally twice as high as those for adults, with the current risk of becoming permanently unemployed; young people throughout Europe are distanced from and disillusioned with the channels of representative democracy, whose institutions and methods are neither willing nor capable of listening and responding positively to their needs and demands; many young people are skeptical of the political and administrative machineries that go along with it; problematic access to education and rising unemployment have obliged young people to rely more and more on family support and therefore curtailing their independence. The basic result of all this is the lack of confidence in European institutions and policies and an increasingly scattered continent (due to inequalities, different access to education and mobility, etc.). That\u2019s why, nowadays, young people, wherever they live and perhaps more than ever before, need to gain and be able to use life management skills and the capacity for critical judgment, in order to be able to answer a set of questions they will have to face in future scenarios of EU: are some Europeans at risk of becoming permanently unemployable? how can Europe better integrate migrants? is people becoming more racist? why should young people bother voting in elections? is the EU still only an economic bloc that countries join (only) for economic reasons? will countries ever decide to join or stay in the Union because of the common good (if such thing exists) instead of their national interests? Moreover, all these factors also translate in the lack of \u201cbelonging\u201d: young people do not feel as European citizens. YEU believes that the development of European identity is an unfinished business which risks jeopardizing the concept of Europe itself and that has to be addressed: is a common European identity possible? what are the values and ideals that bring us together as European citizenship and how can we awake and embed them in us? \"Europe from Scratch\" actually aims at bringing participants on a journey through the roots and values of Europe and of YEU (dignity,social inclusion,solidarity,tolerance,human rights,dialogue) and to give them the opportunity to reflect and think about the birth of Europe and the concepts of European identity and citizenship, in order to \"re-create\" European society/community from scratch, overcoming cultural differences and setting common goals and values. Through 2 youth exchanges, young people will: investigate current trends and issues; learn about European roots and history; gather different perspective on Europe and European identity; identify and create small practical tools that will help youth workers, trainers and youth organizations to deal with a changing Europe and its future scenarios; have the opportunity to recreate Europe from scratch, and therefore reflect on values/ideals,objectives, frameworks, institutions, relationships at the base of it; spread the information and increase awareness on the future of EU by creating and disseminating a set of guidelines and a shared \u201cAgenda for future of Europe\u201d. The job shadowing period, involving 1 youth worker from partner organizations, will be fundamental in order to create continuity among the exchanges, to better develop and shape the guidelines and the agenda, to collect additional data among YEU members. This activity will also help to boost quality in partner organizations that will want to keep on working on this topics, since the participant will share his/her experiences through online blogs and platforms. All activities will be carried out through flexible, variable and innovative NFE methodologies. Finally, the project objective is to give young people, youth workers and youth organizations the opportunity to reflect on the origins and roots of Europe, what values and ideals keep it together and how these values can be \"adapted\" and used to build a common and passionate feeling of belonging and of European identity in the world of today.", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE05-KA105-001867_1"], ["5LR", "BREAD & ROSES - FIGHTING MULTIPLE DISCRIMINATION", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 14808.0, "\"BREAD & ROSES - FIGHTING MULTIPLE DISCRIMINATION\" is a project aimed at addressing and exploring the concepts of Islamophobia and multiple discrimination on the grounds of gender, ethnicity and religion and at empowering young european women by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to create a more equal and inclusive society.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are: \r\n- To promote intercultural dialogue and learning\r\n- To promote inclusion, tolerance and mutual understanding / fight generalization, racism and stereotypes\r\n- To fight radicalization and islamophobia among european young people and local communities\r\n- To analyze and counteract the disproportionate impact of Islamophobia on Muslim women\r\n- To counter stereotypes about Muslim women and promoting more positive messages in order to address the intersectional discrimination affecting women (gender, race, class, nationality, migration status and religion)\r\n- To create solidarity and empathy among European young women and to empower them as key drivers of change in their local communities and at the European level\r\n\r\n\"Bread & Roses\" will gather 28 female participants and 7 facilitators/group leaders with different backgrounds (nationalities, religion, orientation) coming from 7 different countries around Europe (Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Macedonia/FYROM, Spain and UK).

Societies we live in expect us to develop identities following certain standards and fulfilling norms. Although emancipation has happened already and women are allowed to wear trousers and vote, understandings of rights and choices are not the same in different parts of Europe and the world. For this reason, through this exchange we want to connect young women from different societies to talk, discuss, share and understand each other.

To know that they are beings of love and passion and not there to please others and their standards.

There is a constant need for new and innovative methods, which would ease this process and also give them an inspiring environment to develop their potential. Artistic forms of expressions are very promising in this field for several reasons. Regarding the aspect of personal development, artistic methods are very powerful as they give an opportunity for self- discovery. In the process of creation, we always express more than we are consciously aware at the moment. Especially the spontaneous creations in an improvisation setting are very useful in this sense and the outcomes can be used as a mirror to reflect on your \u2018inner world\u2019. Apart from the benefit regarding personal development, they have the clear advantage of not relying on spoken language. This can be very helpful while organizing international encounters with people whose language skills are not good enough to get into verbal communication.

Most of them were Syrian, followed by Afghans and Iraqis. They arrived and are still arriving in a moment of time where many citizens in European countries feel threatened by foreigners. In about every European country there is a heavy debate ongoing, on how to deal with the situation. Populist political parties profit from these sentiments, using simple slogans like \u2018no more foreigners\u2019. At the same time, it would not be correct to call all people who are critical towards the recent immigration wave \u2018bigots\u2019 or \u2018racists\u2019. Then we would basically shut down the discussion. Furthermore, we see that the debates of today are very much based on stereotypes and prejudices. With this project we call for a dialogue, to share opinions from all sides to develop better informed opinions. We also believe that knowledge is the key to understanding and compassion. This training course is organized for representatives of youth organizations from different European countries, to create a common strategy. As the crisis is a cross-border problem, it only makes sense to coordinate our actions in a European framework. After the training, the participating youth workers will be able to promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue in local and international activities. This project aims to equip youth workers with competences to promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue in local and international activities, particularly focused on the European Refugee Crisis. Objectives:\u2022 to exchange knowledge between representatives from different European youth organizations about the European Refugee Crisis: its origins and how way countries deal with it, including the public response;\u2022 to get a thorough understanding of concepts such as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination;\u2022 to promote intercultural, interreligious dialogue and respect for human rights;\u2022 to develop detailed, realistic plans to promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue in local and international projects;\u2022 to promote the Erasmus Plus programme.There will be in total 25 youth workers involved, and a team of 5 trainers and organizers will guide the process and manage the logistics. The working methods are based on non-formal education, with brain storms, group discussions, inputs, learning by doing, theatrical methods, energizers etc. The project will have a big impact on several target groups and fields: on the participating youth workers, on the participating youth organizations, on the youngsters in those organizations and on the general public. The participants will learn about prejudices, about the situation in Europe, about setting up local activities and on transferring knowledge and skills to youngsters in their organizations. The youngsters will be actively contributing to the society (and acquiring useful skills and attitudes) by implementing the different local activities.

The project takes the refugee situation in Europe as the context for which such values could be discussed, based on the policies of differing countries in Europe on how to handle the incoming refugees, as well as attitudes of the local population.  In addition to an examination of the current situation, the experiential and interactive activities in this training course shed light on our own practices of inclusion and exclusion within a small group.  Perhaps it is easier to hold up our values when speaking in theory, but in actuality, there are far deeper and more complex dilemmas in ourselves to discover.  This discovery allows for a greater empathy, as it no longer puts a conflicting line between our moral positions.  It allows for an examination of needs, especially in a conflict, so as to realize that my need in one situation might be yours in another.The objectives of this project are as follows:- To become aware of the mechanism of exclusion in ourselves- To see how this mechanism of exclusion is projected in society today, especially in Europe- To explore what we can do to make conditions more inclusive in our own communities- To become aware of the minorities of Europe and the relationship between majorities and minorities.- To use interactive activities to learn non-formally through the experience.There will be 22 participants and 3 trainers for this project, and they will come from 10 countries across Europe.  The training course will take place in Aghveran, Armenia, in a training facility outside of Yerevan, allowing for a focused discussion into these topics.  Participants will be diverse in age, and will include those with fewer opportunities, either who have never left their countries, or have what would be considered a lower socio-economic status.  There will also be a conscious effort to make the training gender balanced.The activities taking place will run over 6 days, with 2 travel days before and after.  The methodology will primarily be interactive, task-based activities, where the participants explore a certain topic, or engage in a task (in small groups), and then come back to plenary to reflect together.  The role of the trainers is to ask questions which might bring up some dilemmas, to encourage them to open up questions, rather than hold onto answers and opinions.  As the week goes on, participants become more open and free to express themselves, and this also means that conflict may occur.  There will also be a conflict resolution methodology used to allow them to connect to their needs and increase their empathy.  The result is a greater awareness of themselves and how they affect others, as well as an ability to see beyond arguments and into the each other's needs. They also compare this to the greater societal issues now relevant (i.e. the Refugee crisis) and can understand more about society and their role in it.The long term benefits include an ability to contribute to society through each person's grown sense of responsibility that they access through this training course.

In fact, more than a million migrants and refugees crossed into Europe in 2015, sparking a crisis as countries struggled to cope with the influx and with integration issues. By now, the \u201cEU response to the refugee crisis has been chaotic and divisive, characterized by squabbling over sharing responsibility, cascading border closures and finger-pointing. (\u2026) And recent events in Paris and Brussels have interjected fear of terrorism into the mix.\u201d (J. Sunderland, Associate Director, Europe and Central Asia Division - Human Rights Watch). Historically, however, the EU has a long record of migrations and European societies have been dealing with increasing diversity for years, in such a way that we may all consider ourselves as \u201cmigrants\u201d. Yet, with the last year trends in migration flows, opinion and political debates all over Europe have been increasingly shaped by concerns about cultural identity, social cohesion, security, access to public services, crime and employment, always largely focusing on the immigrant population as a stereotyped and generalized \u201cwhole\u201d. To make things worst, the European Union does not require any particular integration approach. The EU Common Basic Principles (2004) define integration as \u201ca dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States\u201d. But actual national and regional policies have too often tended toward coercive integration (such as discriminatory measures such as religious-dress bans in France, Belgium and parts of Italy and Spain). As J. Sunderland underlines, \u201cmany of those who have risked their lives to reach Europe this year will have strong motivation to do what they can to rebuild their lives in their new homes. But integration policies that require people to shed fundamental aspects of their identity are unlikely to succeed. Sustainable integration should aim at giving migrants a real stake in their new home, encouraging participation rather than exclusion, while requiring full adherence to laws and respect for the rights of others.\u201d This perspective is included not only in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.In this sense, guided by its principles and values, PROJECT2020 and its partners believe that the starting point of any sustainable integration policy should be the respect for migrants and refugees as individuals, with their own stories, dreams and competences. We feel that youth organizations and European youth can have a great role in addressing this gap. By meeting the refugees/migrants and collecting their stories (needs, dreams, fears, personal stories, journeys, expectations, goals, hopes, competences, skills, contributions), they can provide the host population with accurate and fair information about who refugees are and what are the benefits of welcoming them in the local community, promoting therefore an inclusive and tolerant society, able to recognize and value personal talents and to empower and integrate them. Aims and general objectives will be, therefore, to develop and promote a new positive narrative of inclusion, giving the chance to young europeans and young migrants to meet and share their stories (their journeys) in order to match them with the needs of the communities they live in. Specific objectives will be: - To contribute to migrants and refugees integration- To promote intercultural dialogue and learning- To promote inclusion, tolerance and mutual understanding / fight generalization, racism and stereotypes- To promote a change of perception towards migration and refugees- To analyze the migrants\u2019 background, the migration flows and reasons behind it- To avoid generalization and promote \u201creal life encounters\u201d / to meet refugees and collect their stories - To raise awareness on the feelings, hopes, needs, fears, dreams, expectations, competences and skills of migrants/refugees and on their positive contribution to local communities- To develop strategies to match community needs and migrants\u2019 storiesThe project also foresees the following expected results: - A final publication/book in which thoughts, reflections stories of migrations developed as \u201cmodern fairy-tales\u201d will be presented- Promotion of the concept of \u201ccommunity match\u201d, defined as the opportunity to match the stories, skills and knowledge of the migrants with the needs and opportunities of the community they live in- A social campaign aiming at changing the perception and view of local communities towards migrants and refugeesThe project will involve 28 young people and 7 youth workers/facilitators from 7 countries in one APV (to be held in september 2016), a youth exchange in Cardiff - UK (to be held at the end of september/beginning of october 2016) and a youth exchange in Thessaloniki - Greece (november 2016).", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024694_coordinator"], ["5LR", "Experiential Education", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 17051.0, "Experiential Education is a 9 day training course funded by the Eramus+ Youth in Action programme on developing youth workers competence in delivering experiential education to Young People especially those from marginalized, vulnerable and underprivileged backgrounds.

So the objectives of the project are:\r\n1) to increase interest to European culture, language, history, art of Russian youth;\r\n2) to create the kind social atmosphere in SFERA, the workcamps or other places of work \u2013 friends, interesting spending of spare time, personal development;\r\n3) to involve Russian volunteers into work with such groups of youth;\r\n4) to adopt the world  international experience of work with youth to Russian conditions and to show staff of Russian NGOs other way of working, to teach them European style;\r\n5) to participate, lead and co-ordinate activities aimed inclusion of disadvantaged youth into international youth programs.\r\n\r\nThe project meets aim of EVS, because it is directed on development of solidarity and promotion of active citizenship and mutual understanding among young people. First of all, the volunteer will show his culture, will find new contacts. All these activities will be connected with European culture, thus the mutual understanding among volunteer and Russian youth will be developed. Besides, the EVS volunteer will increase interest to foreign cultures and languages, will try to break some stereotypes and as a result he will help Russians to develop tolerance to other people.\r\n\r\nAlso, the priorities of the Erasmus+ Programme are met by context of the project \u2013 the volunteer in realising his own project can influence the community by this way as well as involve Russian volunteers to participation of this project. Youth in Europe are much more involved in non-fornal education than in Russia, and a volunteer will try to smooth over these differences promoting European awareness by this way. So Erasmus+ priorities are matched by the project. As it\u2019s planned that the volunteer will actively involve Russian NGOs into international activities, and help them raising at this new challenge, it\u2019ll contribute to developing the quality of support systems for youth activities and the capabilities of civil society organisations in the youth field. Presence of European volunteer in youth organization will give added value to the activities implemented, as it\u2019ll help local volunteers get to know European culture, values and mentality better, and thus \u2013 break stereotypes. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also important to note, that through the project activities volunteer will help unemployed youth in Nizhny Novgorod, providing information about experience in European Union and giving them the opportunity and most importantly, information on how to take part in various youth initiatives across Europe. Needless to say, the project will stimulate sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, creativity, because of the specifics of hosting organization\u2019s work.

This will be conducted mostly with 30 participants within a 21 day youth exchange period in the rural city of Kavadarci post industrial city of Kumanovo with preparation and follow up activities happening across Europe during the projects entire period. \r\n\r\nThe whole project will take place between March 2017 and March 2018. The venues identified are Kavadarci and Kumanovo. \"Born 2 Run: Plus\" will involve a total of 24 youngsters aged 16-26 with 6 leaders from 5 different countries and will have a strong impact at the local level, where each partner organization will be able to involve hundreds of young people through implementation back home.\r\n\r\nA1 (APV) - Partners will agree on all the project contents and methodologies, as well as on logistic and practical aspects, above all concerning local activities.

The aim of the action is to help participants to get a complete overview on the skills required to run community sporting events with an inclusive perspective. Participants will have the chance to share perspectives and inputs from their own countries, but above all they will be able to meet young people and locals and get to know their experiences, applying an exchange of experience approach in order to gather and \"explore\" the different perspectives.

These will consist of trail runs, road runs, track runs, short and long runs as well as walks and routes that double up as bike tracks also.  The participants will create and essential Runs map of Kavadarci and Kumanovo municipalities while searching for, developing and commenting these routes of a 3 week period. The exchange will conclude with Kumanovo's first 10km race as well as a small street festival to promote healthy lifestyles. Alongside the 10km race will be a 5 & 3km race as well as a choice of walks for inclusion of all no matter there ability. This the reason the exchange is in September as it is the best time of year for such an event, Kavadarci and Kumanovo are too hot in June, July and August and will be too cold in December. \r\n\r\nThe exchange will use non-formal and informal educations methods to combat the cultural barriers that may occur during the exchange, promote team work and critical thinking, develop a sense of European citizenship and highlight the need for a healthy lifestyle.

Hordaland is a region in growth, having reached half a million inhabitants it is now one of the fastest growing counties in Norway. This development creates opportunities as well as challenges. There are increasing numbers of skilled workers who now face unemployment, at the same time there is a gap between skills and the needs on the labour market. These challenges require restructuring and flexible solutions that demand more relevant and competent professional expertise and competences, new and innovative methods as well as an increasing need for more relevant vocational education and training.International cooperation is an integral part of HCC\u2019s strategy for regional development (International Strategy 2013-2016). As the challenges the region is faced with are not only valid for Hordaland, HCC sees international cooperation as a tool in finding possible solutions to challenges that are either common for many, or that are transregional/ transnational.HCC aims at using Erasmus+ VET Mobility 2016-18 as a strategic tool in developing the region. The programme will be an important contribution in meeting both the challenge of restructuring, as well as creating closer cooperation between VET and the labour market. Further, the programme will be important in improving language and intercultural competences.HCC has been an active user of mobility programmes, and has sent a large number of VET pupils on mobilities every year. This year we also aspired, and worked strategically to increase the number of participants within staff mobility.By including participation in the Erasmus+ programme as a tool in the Competence Development Plan 2016-20 (CDP), we aim to strengthen professional skills and intercultural competences among VET teachers. Including job shadowing abroad into the CDP, contributes to the quality of the projects as well as long term competence development. Teachers from work committees for vocational specific programmes (FAU), working across several schools, have also been included in this application. This will strengthen professional skills and competences, as well as being an important contributor in the dissemination of results. This year we have also made an effort to include staff mobility to the mobilities for apprentices. Giving mentors the opportunity to take part in a work placement together with their apprentice will not only improve the quality of training, but also increase the impact of the mobility. Sustainable development requires international cooperation across sectors, administrative levels and disciplines. There is a need to gain knowledge and insight into the disciplines that future businesses will require. The project has therefore placed emphasis on developing interdisciplinary group mobilities. It will increase the expertise and networks across different sectors, enhance value creation and innovation, facilitate better use of regional advantages and enhance restructuring to greener jobs. An example involving technology is a group from Nordhordaland (vocational school, business and municipality) that intends to visit Denmark to further develop the industrial foundation in Mongstad in a greener and more progressive direction.In this, and future projects, HCC will work more systematically to increase the quality of preparation and implementation. Quality management and preparation are important for the desired effects and impact of the projects, such as attitudes, shared responsibility, reflection, enhanced cultural awareness as well as more active and positive participation in a multicultural Norwegian and international society and work force. HCC is applying for 37 mobility projects which count 173 pupils and apprentices from 15 different upper secondary schools and 4 training offices, and 68 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 29 mobility projects which count 178 staff from 28 businesses, municipalities, VET schools and other regional developers. The disciplines represented in this application includes: health care/social work, restaurant/hotel, industrial technology, design/crafts, agriculture, electricity/electronics, and tourism. In addition, the mobility projects will cover themes such as entrepreneurship, green and blue growth, innovation, progressive healthcare, school administration, assessment, and cooperation between VET and businesses. As a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects. The majority of the pupils are under the age of 18, and it is important that they are accompanied while traveling to and from their host countries. The accompanying persons will assist the pupils while traveling and make sure the pupils settle in at both their place of accommodation and the work place.", "http://www.cardiff.gov.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-NO01-KA116-021918_31"], ["3BD", "Mobility Opportunities for Vocational Educational and International Training", "CCW-TRAINING ACADEMY LIMITED", 110167.0, "The goal of ADICE, and of the project, is to ensure the social and professional development of the learners (including those with fewer opportunities), by participating in a valuable mobility experience. ADICE considers the mobility experience as a tool allowing the development of technical, transverse and social skills which favors employment. The project \u201cMOVE IT: Mobility Opportunities for Vocational Educational and International Training\u201d plans for two years, from the 1st of June 2016, the sending of 40 learners in vocational training, in mobility for purposes of learning, in the eligible countries of the European Union, planned in our partnership agreement: in United Kingdom, in Malta, in Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Germany, Spain, Poland, Romania and Greece. These mobility projects will be characterized by professional internships in companies or within non for profit organizations, and would last for 3, 6 or 10 months.These placements will be organized and defined according to the experience, sector of activity, professional project, needs, expectations at short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goal is to promote the European mobility, but also to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person.  Applications are thus estimated with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. At the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures who organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.Our partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom, etc.) a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end.  The diversity of the partners allows us to answer the majority of the candidates\u2019 needs. Thus, our international strategy aims to offer internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.Regarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Nord-Pas-De-Calais area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is largely exceeding the national rate (12.8%, while 10.0% in metropolitan France, especially for Young people aged from 15 to 24 years old, with a 23.6% unemployment rate, data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2015). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 22% of the local population. With mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.careerchangewales.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA116-023570_5"], ["4UW", "Digital Competence - a vision for Europe", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", 128439.0, "The Welsh Government introduced the Digital Competency Framework (DCF) as a priority for schools in September 2016 but schools in Wales have a long way to go before effectively introducing these skills across the curriculum.

The training will take place in Brussels (Belgium) in November 2017 and will involve a total of 15 different partners from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania, Egypt, Portugal, Kosovo*, FYROM/Macedonia, UK and Ukraine. The project will involve 30 youth workers/facilitators from 15 different countries. \r\n\r\nThe main objective of the project is to develop and promote a new positive narrative of inclusion, giving the chance to young europeans and young migrants to meet and share their stories (their journeys) in order to match them with the needs of the communities they live in. To do so, we plan to train youth workers (and educators, staff members, volunteers, etc.) on two complementary methodologies and approaches: on one side, participants will  learn how to use storytelling as a tool that can foster unique encounters and create inclusion (sharing a story is like sharing a bit of ourselves with the people around us: this is the perfect cure to any form of intolerance and radicalization!) ... while on the other side, they will explore and further develop the concept of \"community matching\". This consists in observing local communities and realities in order to find inclusion opportunities that would match with the dreams, hopes and competences of the asylum seekers/migrants/refugees previously met. Participants will therefore transform themselves in storytellers and sociologists, and they will be mentored, in their search for new inclusive methodologies and tools, by interns and volunteers (all migrants and refugees with granted asylum) from the Brussels-based refugees project/network \"Tandem\". Through the TC, we will build the personal and professional capacities of youth workers and educators to deal with the needs and claims for inclusion in the local communities we live in. The specific objectives will be: \r\n- To contribute to migrants and refugees integration by promoting intercultural dialogue, inclusion, tolerance and mutual understanding\r\n- To promote a change of perception towards migration and refugees, within young people and communities\r\n- To avoid generalization and promote \u201creal life encounters\u201d / to meet refugees and collect their stories\r\n- To raise awareness on the feelings, hopes, needs, fears, dreams, expectations, competences and skills of migrants/refugees \r\n- To explore and develop the concept of \"Community matching\"\r\n- To foster the role of youth organizations in creating sustainable integration and bridges among young refugees and young Europeans\r\n- To increase the quality of youth work by providing youth workers and youth organisations with additional tools to address inclusion and integration needs in local communities and in Europe\r\n\r\nThe project also foresees the following expected results: \r\n- A final publication, developed as an online interactive platform, in which thoughts, reflections stories of migrations developed as \u201cmodern fairy-tales\u201d will be presented - each \"fairytale\" (story) will have different open finales among which users will be able to choose: in this way, the platform will show them different opportunities (already existing in their communities) and actions (something that they can also initiate, from daily behaviors to voluntarism) that would allow to reach the \"inlucsion happy ending\". \r\n- Promotion of the concept of \u201ccommunity match\u201d, defined as the opportunity to match the stories, skills and knowledge of the migrants with the needs and opportunities of the community they live in. This will be partially addressed in the final publication and web platform. However we believe the approach should be further developed and tested: for this reason, partners already committed to develop some topic-related local activity, that will allow to test different tools and to better observe the local community (and the possibility to have ... a match!) \r\n- A social campaign aiming at changing the perception and view of local communities towards migrants and refugees: the campaign will play on empathy and strong-impact data that could move citizens and young people to take action in some way. We will develop the campaign thanks to the practical labs that are included in the training course (as tests of Storytelling methodologies)\r\n\r\nThe starting point of any sustainable integration policy should be the respect for migrants and refugees as individuals, with their own stories, dreams and competences.

And it is soon becoming a fundamental feature of modern societies. Intercultural learning was tentatively defined in different studies and conclusions during the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) as a process \"that comprises an open and respectful exchange or interaction between individuals, groups and organizations with different cultural backgrounds or world views; whereas among its aims are: to develop a deeper understanding of diverse perspectives and practices; to increase participation and the freedom and ability to make choices; to foster equality; and to enhance creative processes\" (European Parliament resolution of 19 January 2016 on the role of intercultural dialogue, cultural diversity and education in promoting EU fundamental values - 2015/2139(INI)).\r\nICL helps youth to better comprehend cultures in modern societies and respect them. It reinforces the communication between people from different cultures and stimulates social interaction. It also helps young people recognize the cultural diversity and recognize the common heritage of humanity. It is therefore a key competence in order to read and adapt to the challenges that Europe is now facing, referring in particular to a generic crisis of values and references and to the continuous influx of migrants and refugees. \r\nHowever, as educators, youth workers and organizers of youth events and activities at the local and at the european level, we feel that this dimension, so important and fundamental, is often given for granted in these projects or it's diminished in what is usually called \"the intercultural night\". We fear this is not how true ICL can be fostered and promoted, we see instead the risk that these practices of competing to present our own countries as touristic offices could be counterproductive, nourishing young people nationalism and radicalism. Therefore, we think it's the moment to act and to go beyond intercultural learning, by experimenting new tools and approaches (I-LAB)!! \r\nWe want, together, to renew our educational approach to ICL: we live in the first globalized society, where everything and everyone is interconnected and where stereotypes are everywhere... but to understand and internalize true ICL we need explanations, debriefings, debates and what we call a \"human touch\". We are all (all our members, educators, trainers, youth workers, volunteers) feeling this need and we are all eager to contribute to the innovation process. The aim of our project is therefore to develop a new innovative approach to ICL and to consequently equip youth trainers, youth workers, organizers and volunteers with the necessary competences, knwoledge and practical tools to foster a human and true intercultural dimension in all the projects they deliver (especially the ones under the E+ framework and especially those addressing refugees and migrants). \r\nThe specific objectives of the course are:\r\nto start a shared and dynamic lab aimed at creating innovative methodologies and tools for intercultural dialogue and learning, with a specific attention to the inclusion and integration processes of young refugees and migrants in the local communities and in the youth organizations\r\nto contribute to the professional and personal development and to improve the competences of the youth workers and educators of partner organizations, providing tools, knowledge and skills useful to face the need for intercultural dialogue among young people and their communities\r\nto contribute to improve quality in youth work, at the local and european level, keeping into consideration the changes and challenges of today\u2019s society as for the inclusion and integration of young people with different cultural backgrounds\r\nto contribute to fight radicalization and xenophobia among young europeans and local communities, providing with opportunities of intercultural dialogue and real and true encounters\r\nIn this way, we will train active multipliers able to intervene at the local level and to develop new events, raising social awareness towards true interculturalism in society and above all in the youth sector.\r\nThe project will involve 2 activities: \r\n- a prep meeting with 10 experts from 7 different countries who will meet in Tortona (Italy) in november 2017 in order to analyze and discuss the theoretical and methodological background and who will develop a draft of the innovative approach in the following two months\r\n- a training course (Tortona, february 2018) for 30 educators/youth workers/junior trainers/organizers and representatives of youth organizations from 16 different countries, who will work together to finalize and test new practical tools for intercultural learning and dialogue, based on the theoretical and methodological inputs given by the experts", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT03-KA105-010691_3"], ["3AP", "Intercultural learning and mobility for young people XIplus", "UNA Exchange", 13716.0, "The project Intercultural learning and mobility for young people XIplus is a mobility project within European Voluntary Service, which involves the hosting of 2 english volunteers in the cooperative Ture Nirvane for 4 and 5 months and of 1 german volunteer in association Sant\u2019Andrea.\r\nDuring their stay in Italy they will support the host organizations with activities in the youth, social and cultural field, in contrast with social exclusion and marginalization and for the exchange of best practice in the topic of sustainability and health..

This is a novelty that few would want reversed, but it should not surprise us that the ever-expanding world of online interaction has also come to reflect and feed back into many of the difficulties that human beings have historically encountered in their \u2018real\u2019 existence. Intolerance and \u2018hate\u2019 have been a feature of human society almost since time began. A number of studies have identify an increase in these attitudes over recent years. The problem is that if there is less tolerance of differences, and if the constraints on that intolerance are not watched, then intolerance \u2013 and hate \u2013 will find expression, both in the things that people do and in the things they say. The internet has opened up new ways of saying things, and it has opened up new avenues to say them to more people. The constraints, however, on what we can say online are far fewer than those which exist off-line: we can say things over the Internet that we would not dare to say in public in the \u2018real\u2019 world. If hate speech offline is a problem that societies have recognised, and found the need to address, is online hate speech something that we can ignore? Of course not.\r\nYoung people are already suffering from online hate speech:\r\n \u2022 Across Europe, 6% of 9 to 16-year-old Internet users reported having been bullied online, and 3% confessed to having bullied others.\r\n\u2022 16% of young Internet users in Europe say they have posted comments on the Internet that were hateful towards a person or group of people.\r\n \u2022 78% of the respondents of an online survey stated they had encountered hate speech online on a regular basis. The three most recurrent targets of hate speech were: LGBT people (70%), Muslims including refugees and migrants of Muslim origin (60%) and women.\r\nThe problem is huge, and it becomes bigger and bigger especially in nowadays when we all face economic  breakdown and unemployment as result, huge refugee wave, raise of extremism and terrorism etc. All those challenges contributes to spreading hate speech online, as young people are in the situation of ambiguity and frustration.\r\nIn 2012, Advisory Council on Youth of Council of Europe started the No Hate Speech Movement, the campaign that aimed to combat the hate speech online in all its forms, and with this \u201cNo hate\u201d project we want to contribute to making internet a safer place for young people and to prevent human rights violation online.\r\nThe issues that will be addressed by competences developed during the project are:\r\n\u2022 Decrease the level of aggression and intolerance online through civil society organisations/youth workers.\r\n\u2022 Perception of phenomena of hate speech and its influence on young people's lives.\r\n\u2022 Subjective opinion, memory and bias.\r\n\u2022 Human rights online\r\n\u2022 Peace-building\r\n\u2022 Internet literacy\r\n\u2022 Freedom of speech\r\n\u2022 Promoting intercultural dialogue\r\n\u2022 Preventing radicalization of young people\r\nA project \u201cNo hate\u201d is a long-term project aiming at combating  with the hate speech online and to promote no hate speech movement among young people, if approved it will consist of  TC and YE:\r\nThe first activity, a training course will be run in Armenia, 9-17 September 2016 This will be TC for youth workers teachers and trainers aiming to equip them with knowledge and skills on how to tackle the topic of hate speech with young people through non-formal education.\r\nThe second activity (youth exchange) will be run in Luxembourg on 7-16 December 2017 That will be a youth exchange on internet literacy, that will involve not just young people but also bloggers and online activists. After this exchange, we expect our group to start the online campaign \u201cBe the change: make internet safe for everybody\u201d.", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LU01-KA105-023921_6"], ["5NE", "Labyrinth in the Head", "The Republic of the Imagination", 11560.0, "The main objective of the project \u201eLabyrinth in the Head\u201d is to equip youth workers with Sensory Labyrinth Theatre (SLT) method, which helps them in their every day work with the youth to address personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees/ migrants and to disseminate the European common values, especially connection to common humanity and compassion. \r\n\r\n6 organisations from 5 European countries, who are partners in this project, have pointed out intolerance towards refugees in their home countries. \r\n\r\nOn the local (community) level people tend to express intolerance through hate speech and hate acts. There have been reports about vandalism in refugee centres in the very beginning they were established. Several neo-nazi groupings have got wind under their wings and right-wing parties have got more supporters. \r\n\r\nOn personal level a lot of local people believe that refugees represent a threat to host countries, that there is a lot of terrorists among refugees, that they want to spread islam and steal jobs from the local. In addition local people are afraid of losing their own identity, nationality, culture, religion, jobs etc. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the core of the problem lies in dehumanization of refugees, dividing people into \u201eus\u201d and \u201ethem\u201d. What is needed most by both refugees and people living in countries who host them is a sense of connectedness: a connection to common humanity. In our opinion, drama methods are best to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nSLT provides this connectedness for those who engage with it. From this connection to common humanity, which transcends cultural and even linguistic differences, compassion emerges naturally. SLT harnesses this emerging compassion and supports participants to channel it in useful ways to support and guide each other through uncertain and precarious times.\r\n\r\n18 youth workers from 5 European countries will meet on 25.09.-04.10.2017 in Tartu, Estonia in a training to learn SLT methods. 8 days long training includes morning and afternoon SLT workshops lead by creator of SLT method, Iwan Brioc, evaluation sessions in the end of every day, SLT performances in the end of the training to try out and share the results of the training, socializing time etc. All this serves the aim to equip the participating youth workers with competence and methods for addressing personal- and local level challenges associated with refugees.\r\n\r\nTo deepen understanding of refugees' situation every group prepares a research of the current refugees crisis as a homework \u2013 what are the main personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees in their countries. The researches are presented in the beginning of the training session. During training Skype interview with Syrian refugees in Turkey and a meeting with refugees in Estonia take place to provoke intercultural dialogue and search for similarities in differences. \r\n\r\nDuring this training the youth workers have chance to experience the method themselves through exercises. Then they work in groups and create for each other improvisational sensory journeys. Also they can try the method out with the adults. After acquiring the essence of the method they create sensory portals and form a structure of the SLT production for the youth. They learn to use and tune this method on a very specific topic - refugees, which is very relevant in nowadays' world. \r\n\r\nAfter the training 18 youth workers are ready to use SLT in their every day youth work. To test it partner organisations will arrange 4-6 dissemination events after the training course. So the participants/ participating organisations can try out their competence to use SLT as a method to address personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees, share their multi-pointed overview of the current refugee crisis and disseminate European common values. \r\n\r\nCapacity to use SLT methods in addressing personal- and local-level challenges associated with refugees/ migrants or other socially sensitive topics will be available in youth work field of 6 different countries. Youth workers will use the method of SLT or parts of it (games, exercises) in their daily work with the youth and in community.\r\n\r\nThe local communities and Europe as a whole becomes more tolerant. Disseminating the project results supports the resistance to the hate speech and intolerance and hopefully prevent violent radicalisation of several young people.\r\n\r\n(People in the roles of) refugees/ migrants will find more understanding and help in hosting societies. They will have better opportunities to get involved and integrated into hosting societies. Hosting communities and countries will act more smoothly. Europe as a whole will become again a bit more tolerant. People will acknowledge a little bit more common humanity and compassion in themselves.\r\n\r\nThe project widens its impact through Timo Mikkola's thesis on how to use SLT method in approaching refugee topic, which will be available on web.", "http://www.troti.org", null, "erasmus_2017-2-EE01-KA105-035009_4"], ["3AP", "European Youth Work in South Wales", "UNA Exchange", 65055.0, "\u201cEuropean Youth Work in Wales\u201d will provide a mobility activity for 8 volunteers from Spain, Belgium, France, Poland, Russia and Austria.

It will be held in Kumanovo, Macedonia and Cardiff, Wales, UK and bring together two different partners from distinct different countries; 20 participants will take part support by 4 staff / team members. The youth exchanges will use non-formal methods and activities to help participants connect the use of creative online journalism with inter-cultural learning, breaking down barriers to inclusion, experiential learning, development of critical thinking, developing teamwork and citizenship. The participants will take part in a huge amount of experiential learning themselves through the use of different activities such as research, design, investigative journalism, art, etc..    \r\n\r\nThe main focus of the youth exchanges will be developing an online magazine as a learning tool and form of self development. The educational programme will aim to develop young peoples abilities to use online journalism, artistic pursuits and creativity as a learning tool, formally, informally and non-formally as well as a method of pushing their comfort levels and developing their confidence. Using these methods to raise awareness about youth issues, human separation from the natural world and explore the possibilities to act toward sustainable culture as well as tools for breaking cultural, social and geographical barriers. \r\n\r\nBy exchanging their own experiences on this project, participants will get first-hand practice in inter-cultural learning.

Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person. Participants are supported with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. \r\n\r\nAt the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures which organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.\r\nOur partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end. The diversity of the partners allows us to offer a large panel of relevant opportunities to the participants\u2019 needs and careers. Thus, our international strategy aims at offering internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.\r\n\r\nRegarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Hauts-de-France area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is higher than other area and largely exceeding the national rate (12%, while 9.6% in metropolitan France data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2016). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 30.9% of the local population. \r\nWith mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.careerchangewales.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035846_12"], ["4UW", "All Age Schools", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", 80134.0, "All Age Schools are those that combine at least two stages of a child\u2019s education \u2013 typically primary and secondary.

The centers must bet on a new pedagogical renewal in which the demands of technological updating of society are incorporated. This commitment is reflected in the strategic documents of the European Commission such as Rethinking Education that advocate strengthening the contents of science and technology.\r\nOur training project coincides with this line of action and aims to support the teaching profession, specifically in the teachers of STEAM areas. Promoting the use of science and technology, developing skills and competencies necessary for the 21st century (creativity, innovation, teamwork, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship and solving problems in a very practical and fun way), creating an innovative culture and increasing the number of professionals in sectors of science and technology.\r\nWith this aim we intend to make use of the tools that Erasmus offers us thanks to the values \u200b\u200bthat add internationalization, the increase of mobility and European cooperation of teachers and schools.\r\nRegarding the antecedents of this project, we would like to point out that the Department of Education, and especially the CPR, have placed a strategic bet for the internationalization of schools in the Region since the beginning of European programs such as Comenius. This can be verified in many CPR projects in collaboration with other international centers.\r\nIn this line, we highlight the numerous training activities such as the annual Erasmus Experience Days or the workshops for the preparation of Erasmus projects. In addition, the CPR offers a variety of training activities related to STEAM within the annual Training Plan for teachers in the Region of Murcia. We intend with this, that our teachers experience a different educational system, with different methodologies from the usual ones in Spain so that they can compare and extract from their experience uses and tools to move to the classroom. In addition to promoting the mobility of teachers and the internationalization of schools, involving schools and teachers in European programs and deepening the strategic framework Education and Training 2020 and its document Rethinking Education to identify improvement policies in schools.\r\nWith this objective we have designed a training action that includes 28 teachers from the region with a profile of teachers motivated by innovation through the STEAM methodology and who have a command of the English language that allows them to follow this training in an international context.\r\nThe activities to be carried out are a one-week course in which they will experience the Welsh school reality and they will observe experiences of schools with STEAM combined with visits to schools in Cardiff to observe good practices.\r\nThe methodology that we have followed to design this project starts from the annual detection of needs that we carry out among the entire school community in which there is a demand for training in innovation with STEAM and in internationalization. An online survey has been carried out, taking into account the principles of previous experience, but also giving the opportunity to centers that have not internationalized their management to join programs such as Erasmus. In this selection, the domain of the language in which the training will be carried out has been taken into account, requiring a minimum level of B2.\r\nAmong the results we expect, the most important is the training of teachers in STEAM methodology to join the improvement of educational quality and contribute to the development of the skills and competencies needed for the 21st century (creativity, innovation, teamwork, leadership, communication, entrepreneurship and problem solving) in a very practical and fun way, creating an innovative culture and increasing the number of professionals in sectors of science and technology at the same time that we develop their European dimension.\r\nThe contents developed in the training in Wales will serve to increase the training possibilities in the training activities in the region and the experience will be disseminated in the annual Erasmus days and in the activities related to STEAM.\r\nWith this project we hope to advance the objectives of the 2020 Strategy on the promotion of scientific-technological vocations and achievement of learning thresholds.

To do so, we will take inspiration by the approaches and methodologies suggested by  the CoE \"WE CAN!\" Manual and we'll understand a narrative as \u201ca logical, internally coherent report and interpretation of connected events. Narratives are present cultures transcending a particular moment and space. They are rather stable and collectively shared interpretations and explanations of social reality in which emotions and meaning play an important role.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is where the project \"Brave New You\" was born.

The specific objectives of the project are:\r\n- To build capacities of youth workers to reach out and empower disadvantaged young people of different backgrounds (ethnic, religious, cultural, gender) to be more engaged in societies and voice up their realities\r\n- To enhance social cohesion in communities by bringing closer realities of disadvantaged young people to majority population\r\n- To challenge and deconstruct current narratives related to position of disadvantaged groups in societies (newcomers, women, LGBT+ youth), create new ones and implement them in local communities by using We Can! Manual of Council of Europe and putting it in practice\r\n- To strengthen the impact of youth work on local and european level by engaging disadvantaged youth and majority population (youth) to work together for better and more inclusive societies by celebrating instead of being afraid of differences between them\r\n\r\nThe expected results are:\r\n- 22 youth workers from 9 countries empowered to reach out and engage disadvantaged youth to voice up their realities\r\n- current harming, hateful and divisive narratives identified,  deconstructed and challenged\r\n- new and inclusive narratives created based on reality of communities involved, but still up-scalable in similar realities in Europe\r\n- org. and communities involved are safer and more inclusive for disadvantaged young people and are examples of how Europe can be - inclusive, supportive and celebrating varieties that enrich us\r\n- online campaign (website and social media) with videos, testimonials, challenged and new/alternative narratives\r\n- publication with examples of good practices and user friendly methods/approaches to engage YP in creating counter and alternative narratives\r\n\r\nTo achieve the foreseen objectives and to produce the expected results, we will engage 22 youth workers and 4 group leaders from 10 different countries (Portugal, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Italy, FYROM, Turkey and UK) in a 9 days training (with 2 additional travel dates) that will take place in 3 different locations in Portugal, a small country whose inclusive policies made society more cohesive and open minded (Olhao, Evora, Lisbon/Cascais). The TC will be focused on empowering and equipping youth workers with knowledge, skills and information related to narratives - what are they, how to identify them, challenge them and design the counter ones including educational and human rights based approaches; reaching out strategies - how to identify target groups and allies in this process; preparing for action - how to plan well, mitigate the risks and stay safe and dedicated; how to develop and implement new/counter narratives in local communities, and how to multiply them in other external communities. Part of the TC, in fact, will also support YW to plan local activities in communities and to prepare the online campaign - videos, testimonials, information regarding the choice of narratives to challenge and how to answer to them (new/counter narratives). Follow up activities will mean putting new narratives in practice and creating local action groups (2 youth workers plus at least 10 young people from disadvantaged backgrounds that reflect the diversity of the community), in order to engage them in identifying other existing narratives that are harmful to them and to challenge these narratives together, empowering the YP (and those who work with them - the YW) to become key drivers of policy and social change in their communities", "http://www.project2020cic.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PT02-KA105-005005_10"], ["5LR", "Born 2 Run: Upgraded", "PROJECT 2020 COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 20226.0, "Born 2 Run: Plus (B2RP) is a project / Youth Exchange to promote healthy lifestyles in young people as well as empower young people with the ability to develop sports and recreation in their communities through the development of running tracks and routes as well as other sports activities in Kavadarci and Kumanovo, Republic if Macedonia.

Erasmus+ VET Mobility is one of the tools HCC make use of to meet challenges linked to restructuring, availability of qualified workers and provision of targeted professional training, as well as gaining a more knowledge-based workforce and business/industry. \r\n\r\nAccess to, and availability of knowledge and an adequate supply of qualified labour is a prerequisite for economic development and requires strategic competency-based policies. With its basis in the education system, the purpose of HCC's \"Regional Plan for Expertise and Labour\" (2017) is to provide the labour market and economy with required qualified and skilled labour. Attention is given to the correlation between the labour market and education and training, and cooperation between the two to align skills with labour market needs. \r\n\r\nThe Department of Education and Training\u2019s \"Plan for Competence Development 2016-2020\" is a steering document, which aims at ensuring competence building within upper secondary education. Its objective is to systematically renew and expand the professional and pedagogical competence and knowledge among teachers linking it to the pupils\u2019 and apprentices\u2019 education and training.\r\n\r\nBoth plans contribute to continuous quality development. Targeted and systematic focus on exchange and transfer of knowledge, as well as competence development will ensure that Hordaland has the right skills and competences for the future.\r\n\r\nThe mobility projects in this application emphasise systematic work and quality (mobilisation, implementation, follow-up, evaluation, mapping and the dissemination of good results). Attitudes, behaviour and intercultural understanding are key elements in reaching the goal of making the participants global citizens with sound knowledge of Europe and the world.\r\n\r\nAs internationalisation should be an integrated part of education and training and contribute to the overall quality of education, we work continuously to mobilise schools and training offices to participate in mobility projects. Quality mobility stays give pupils and apprentices the opportunity to acquire further professional knowledge, improve language skills, and create positive attitudes. Further, the mobility stays contribute to the development of transversal skills that will be important in a in a long-term competence development perspective. In this application, we have seen a tendency that companies wish to send their apprentices abroad to cover parts of the curricula that is difficult to complete at home.\r\n\r\nThis project give great importance to the development of cross-sectoral group staff mobilities aiming at strengthening innovative international cooperation across different sectors, fields and levels.\r\n\r\nIt is important to have close links between businesses, the educational sector, and regional/local administration to increase competence and innovation across sectors. Educational provision should be in line with regional needs and restructuring to green workplaces. This year, HCC has especially targeted tertiary VET schools for participation in the project. These projects will address themes such as developing quality tertiary VET, competence requirements for Ocean Space Technology, recent approval and start-up of a study programme about local food culture at Hjeltnes, and the development of a new study programme for alternative energy in collaboration with NCE Maritime Cleantech. These staff mobilities also provide opportunities to create a European network for potential future mobilities of tertiary VET students.\r\n\r\nHCC is applying for 47 mobility projects, which count 177 pupils and 17 apprentices from 13 different secondary VET schools and 7 training offices, and 64 accompanying persons. HCC is also applying for 15 mobility projects, which count 134 staff from various VET institutions, companies, municipalities, industry organisations and other regional development actors. The disciplines represented in this application include health care/social work, restaurant/hotel business, industrial technology, hairdressing, electricity/electronics, landscaping, and office administration. Mobility projects involving cooperation for increased quality of education/training have themes such as aggregate management, welfare technology and dementia care, solid wood, agro-gastronomy, tourism and destination development, recruitment, restructuring, microplastics and strengthening links between VET and the industry.\r\n\r\nAs a school owner, HCC is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the pupils participating in the mobility projects.

This is coupled with a growth in the number of disengaged family amongst our indigenous population.  \r\nDespite work already being undertaken in our regions we recognise that more needs to be done as many families are still not engaged which is impacting on life chances for their children.   \r\nThis project pools our resources and ideas to tackle these difficult to reach families and their children and through collaborative working, teacher training and developing student voice we believe we can work together to improve aspiration and engagement amongst the target family groups our schools have identified.\r\nOur regions support numerous communities who live here, work and attend schools especially since the widening of the European Union and we face challenges within our education systems.

Pupils - inadequate provision for ethnic minority pupils' and peer group isolation; cultural and ethnic discrimination; shortage of school programs focused on communities and support for indigenous families whose children are at risk of becoming NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training)\r\n3.

Many parents have had little or no experience of education or an experience which has left them fearful. Educating parents and families is as important a role in education as education itself and we wish to evoke belief and enthusiasm for education amongst our pupils' families through this project plan. \r\nWhere this project will add an exciting and innovative approach, different to programmes already in place in our countries, is that this project will involve expertise from professionals in 3 counties pulling together the best practices and innovative approaches from our regions. \r\nThe 3 local authorities in each region are fully committed to addressing the themes of this project and have already gone some way towards introducing intervention and the nominated coordinators have extensive experience in managing international projects.  The collective skills of local authority professionals will ensure the quality of project outcomes and goals and objectives are met.\r\nAll other associated partners have been carefully selected to provide expertise that is not available through the services provided by the local authorities.  \r\nIn each case the 12 schools are experiencing challenges in engaging families and a broad variety of experience allows learning opportunities for all participating staff.  Some schools have nominated Family Engagements officers and their expertise will be shared and similar opportunities in participating schools will be identified.\r\nThe planned activities include the production of training materials for teachers and parents.  Parents and their children will be engaged in a variety of activities specifically designed to attract and engage other parents within the individual school contexts.  Professionals from all organisations will take part in transnational meeting to ensure objectives are being met.  Teachers will participate in job shadowing opportunities in partner countries following which they will receive Europass certificates providing staff with valuable additions to CVs in line with EU guidelines. \r\nThe final output will be good practice guidelines bringing together all aspects of the project in a comprehensive guide for other professionals wishing to engage in similar activities and ensuring sustainability", "http://www.cardiff.gov.uk", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000048_coordinator"], ["4UW", "Learning and Teaching Together", "COUNTY COUNCIL OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF CARDIFF", 210943.0, "The partner local authorities aim to take an innovative  strategic view  to reinforce our education  systems and to improve collaboration internally as well as with parents and other external stakeholders.

Indeed in various elections in member states since 2014 the radical right was able to secure between 10% and 25% of votes.  According to the EU document 'The European Union and the Challenge of Extremism and Populism'  as a result of various European strategies and political 'opportunism' , right-wing politics has 'spread into the public space and pervaded traditionally moderate political discourses in Europe'.  These issues are being discussed in the media, within communities and at home, impacting on the views and opinions of our children.These themes have to be handled carefully and sensitively in our multicultural societies hence why the planning for this project has been extensive and the workplan will be conducted by experts in this field and involves young people, parents and members of the wider community in all regions.  This project cannot be carried out by one country in isolation.  We need a collaborative approach bringing in expertise from across Europe to inform and contribute to this complex issue.  Although we are including partners from only 3 countries they are linking to ELAN the European Local Authority Network established by Cardiff Council in 2015.  Partners from this network will join partners in this project in a series of planned events thus broadening access to wider base of expertise.  The first planned project meeting will coincide with an event in Cardiff aimed at bringing professionals from a extensive number of European countries together to discuss a wide number of essential themes, this being one of them. Our objective is to develop materials for use in primary schools following extensive and detailed teacher training.  We recognise that due to the sensitive nature of this project all participating staff need to be highly trained prior to introducing any of these themes in the classroom.  Once trained these individuals will work with experts to begin designing lesson plans utilising the collaborative and extensive knowledge and experience available in all countries.  All teaching materials will be supported by a series of short films created for and designed by experts, teachers and the wider community.  These films will be used as part of the resources developed during the life of this project.The materials will be thoroughly piloted in participating schools before publication and extensive teacher training opportunities for other professionals not involved in this project will be available throughout to widen participation in all regions.

We develop internal evaluation instruments to measure the impact of STEM in different countries on teacher performance and student outcomes. We will conduct a thorough baseline assessment at the start of the project and a detailed impact review at the close.  We will evaluate both hard data and attitudes to STEM subjects using this information to inform progress throughout.  The baseline assessment will look at hard data such as standards in STEM subjects, the choices made by young learners post-school study in digital and other STEM subject areas, engagement in STEM activities at primary level, parental engagement in STEM school based activities etc. and importantly engagement by students with fewer opportunities.  This will be coupled with a study of attitudes linked to gender balance, motivation and identifying role models.  In addition all activities will be evaluated and the results will inform next steps.The impact review will revisit the same content as the baseline the results from which will measure impact overall and provide essential information needed to evaluate the success of the project.  We will be able to show, through standardized testing scores, conclusive and quantitative evidence derived if proposed by this project has a positive impact on student outcomes.

This project aims to provide participating schools with the training and support needed to effect changes to curriculum delivery.We intend to put young people at the heart of this project giving them the opportunity to work with teachers and contributing to the success of the outputs.  Participating teachers will receive comprehensive training on how they can embed creativity across the curriculum and how by improving their own skills in delivering creativity they can raise standards across all subjects but especially in literacy, numeracy and digital competences.   As part of our dissemination and sustainability plans we will train participating teachers to coach others in order to embed creativity across the curriculum in their own setting but also teachers from a wider group of schools, locally, nationally and internationally.  Creative Arts (overarching description of any activity such as drama, music, graphic arts, performing arts, film, visual arts etc.) is increasingly being recognized as an effective tool for working with young people and to give them a means to express themselves openly. Creative Arts is an effective tool to empower all  students including those with behavioural or mental health problems through creativity.  It is a form of expression that improves and enhances physical and emotional wellbeing through reconciling emotional conflicts and fostering self awareness.  In today's society the perception of the success is parallel to academic success.We will include young people from a wide range of ability and socio-economic background.  This projects meets the European Prog. objectives of promoting equity and inclusion by facilitating access to education for learners from a range of ability and those from disadvantaged backgrounds and fewer opportunities compared to their peers.Some participating pupils are disadvantaged because of:-disability.

Our young people will be facing a very different employment market in the next 10-20 years.  Employment opportunities will change  as the use of digital skills increases with rapid developments in technology.Our project is based on the evidence that although students are overall improving their results in external tests, when students leave school many do not have the necessary skills to prepare them for future employment opportunities and life skills.  Many students also feel that while they are prepared for taking part in examinations they do not  have the skills to take responsibility for their own learning and become lifelong learners and that some lessons do not prepare them for post school experiences. Education & Training 2020 identifies that at school level there are still too many students that leave school early and/or do not have the competencies required for 21st century future employment. While overall standards of teaching in many schools is good there are still too many instances where the quality of teaching falls below the expected requirements. OECD International Summit (2011) states that quality of teaching is imperative to improved pupil outcomes; the challenge is to equip all not some teachers for effective learning in the 21st century.The project\u2019s OVERALL AIM is to strengthening the quality of leadership, pedagogy, communities and policy in school education. We have identified the OECD publication (2010) \u2018The Nature of Learning\u2019 which supports our ideas to create a \u2018Culture of Learning\u2019  (CoL) in schools to support high quality teaching & learning by developing processes to meet the needs of learners.Through working with the multi-stakeholder partnership (schools/universities/LA) of this project we will identify these processes and develop an interactive CoL tool/matrix and guidance (O1/O2) for schools and stakeholder to use to identify where their strengths are and what needs to be improved to create an effective CoL.

These will be organised as project management meetings combined with workshop activities and site visits. Between transnational meetings, the partners will conduct surveys and testing in their home regions. A final multiplier event will be held in Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe project has a wide range of target groups and is aiming to influence ways of organising local/regional partnerships and to embed the results into the educational programmes. In this way create attractive, sustainable urban centres and thus make a change for people and the societies as a whole.  Inspire and motivate local planning and economic development authorities; owners of VET Institutions/providers/schools; VET teachers and students, local business and labour market and local policy makers.

Specifically, the EDGE Project aims to develop innovative approaches (career guidance, learner engagement strategies, self-evaluation tools, e-learning resources) in the provision of employability skills development.  Amongst the partners (Ireland, Wales, Portugal, Austria, Greece), these learners comprise both young and mature adults who are early school-leavers, as well immigrants. The opportunity presented by Erasmus+ will enable partners to share best practice, drawn from our considerable collective experience in the delivery of second-chance education for adults and young people.  The Project will explore the area of career guidance and how to identify practical learner progression pathways, including the obstacles (both personal and structural) that they must realistically overcome.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four practical dimensions to the EDGE Project: (1) A comparative examination of the unemployment and activation contexts within the partner countries, each of which has experienced the global economic downturn in different ways.  (2) The sharing of best practice with regard to the ways in which our respective organisations have responded to meet the skill needs of vulnerable adults and young people (e.g. access, engagement, retention, career guidance and employability provision).  (3) An examination of the potential of the Mozilla \u2018Open Badges\u2019 system. This system, which is transferable, trackable and evidence-based, allows the learner to cumulatively gain formal recognition and credits for the skills (non-formal & informal) they learn. (Source: http://www.openbadges.org/).  The intention is that each partner will trial the Open Badges system with a sample group of learners and evaluate its effectiveness and potential as a skills validation mechanism.  (4) The partnership will develop an e-portfolio template as a dynamic and interactive Personal Progression Planning tool.  The e-portfolio will record evidence and illustrate learning gained across modules, programs or different institutions.  It will act as a toolkit to promote self-managed learning and career planning in a continuous developmental process and support the planning and delivery of service in a way that is learner-centred, systematic and effective. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the results and conclusions from the EDGE Project will be widely disseminated, through a variety of media, at local, national and international levels.  It is envisaged that these results will also have positive reputational effects for our organisations and their associated networks and will have real longer term significance (post funding) in terms of how adult education providers can address the unemployment problem.  Furthermore, practical ideas for future cooperation and development will have been identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, our proposal is informed by the European Employment Strategy 2020, which is a strategy to support employment, productivity and social cohesion in Europe.

These problems are strengthened by feelings of disillusionment and in some cases a lack of perspective. One of the causes is the inability of many people, especially young people, to find suitable jobs or even any job at all. Many people are confronted with unemployment or are overqualified for the jobs they hold.Citizen Initiatives for Global Solidarity (CIGS) are small-scale initiatives set up by private citizens in the Global North on a volunteer basis. These small organisations are engaged in improving the living standards of people in the Global South, or dealing with global issues in the North. It is estimated that in Europe there are more than 200 thousand such organisations. People working on a volunteer basis in CIGS gain a valuable set of new skills and capacities, such as in management, language, negotiation, organisation, communication and many more. These skills and capacities are not formally assessed and rarely recognized. Should these skills and capacities be fully recognised they can contribute to the employability of the people who obtain them.The Global STEPS project therefore aims at providing evidence of the added value of global citizenship experience for skills development, facilitating recognition of key competencies developed through global citizenship experience and through this recognition, improved access to quality employment. The project intends to reinforce the positive effect of active global citizenship outside of formal education by raising self-awareness about the competencies people acquire in their global citizenship practices and helping to translate those into saleable skills.The project does so by creating a common understanding of what Global Citizenship entails amongst the 4 partners working in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Close links will be identified in the process with the European Key Competence Framework. With this, the partners will start developing a methodology that enables the identification and qualification of non-formal skills and competencies. A competence builder tool will be generated, and a model item will be developed to introduce into CVs/application forms which will also be applicable to the Europass CV. A certificate will acknowledge the process of acquiring competencies through Global Citizenship experiences. These tools and methodologies will be made accessible through an online interactive platform accessible in the 4 countries that enables participants to assess their current level of non formal skills and find new opportunities to improve their skills and competencies. In order to guarantee that the tools are relevant and well used, guidelines and training will be developed and delivered so that other stakeholder organisations are able to use them. Through development of the tools and platforms, more than 450 people will benefit from the project directly while 50.000 will be reached through dissemination events and other project activities.The project will be evaluated with the outcome mapping method, enabling partners, beneficiaries and CIGS to make assessments at the start and at the end of the project on those aspects and impacts of the project we consider essential.

Therefore it reflects an action that is aiming to respond on real needs detected in the youth sector Europe-wide. Because of that, it presents a genuine base for a long-term strategic partnership which will ensure exchange of practices among youth, research organisations and institutions involved in the project.\r\nThe aim of the project is to initiate and develop an advocacy agenda on necessity of developing quality assurance standards of national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth. Youth organisations gathered in this partnership, with the support of the research partner tend to advocate together on the EU level, within a large platform of youth organisations (YFJ). This way they will encourage creation of Europe-wide quality assurance standards of national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth, which will, finally, contribute to more effective youth policies at the European and national level, as an overall idea behind the proposed project. By engaging NYCs from several EU countries in this advocacy process on the EU level, as organisations representing thousands of young people all over the EU, this strategic partnership will directly influence on stimulating the active\r\nparticipation of young people in EU policy making.\r\nProject will be implemented through following activities: (1) Mapping of key issues in developing and implementing youth policy strategic documents from perspective of NYCs in order to prepare adequate module for the (2) NYC capacity building training, which will give project partners necessary skills and knowledge for (3) development of advocacy tool which will be communicated with relevant stakeholders through (4) consultations with national bodies in charge of youth, to collect their opinions on the recommendations stated in the advocacy paper and to secure their support in the later stage of the process where concrete recommendations should be implemented. After this (5) advocacy process towards the YFJ will be initiated through presentation the project on the thematic square during the YFJ\u2019s General Assembly and through advocacy on official adoption of the created advocacy paper. After the presentation of the advocacy paper to the YFJ membership, (6) Follow-up meeting on planning future actions will be organized as last official activity of the project. Depending on the outcome of the advocacy process, project partners\r\nwill discuss and suggest follow up steps.\r\nTwo major results are to be achieved by implementing this activities: (R1) advocacy agenda on quality assurance standards of national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth will be developed by and accepted within a large platform of youth organisations (YFJ) and (R2) capacities of national youth councils from the EU countries will be strengthened to create and monitor concrete national strategic and programme documents in the field of youth.\r\n \r\nResults applied on member organisations of the YFJ, representatives of the national bodies in charge of youth policy within the states from which NYCs involved in project are coming and representatives of the EU and Council of Europe bodies in charge of youth as three target groups which are to be addressed by this activity plan will achieve following impacts:\r\n(1)  It will strengthened and empower the representatives of the project partner organisations\r\n(2)  It will raise awareness of other YFJ member organisation on the necessity of youth advocacy within the area of policy development\r\n(3)  It will raise the awareness of the representatives of bodies in charge of youth policy development on both levels (those on national and those on EU) on the necessity to secure better monitoring of the effects of youth policies on national and EU level  \r\n(4)  The implementation of a unique quality assurance standards for strategic and programme documents in the field of youth will start in different European countries\r\n(5)  Easier monitoring of the effects of youth policy will be possible and thus will give clearer insight into what are the real perspectives of the currently implementing policy solutions in this field.\r\nThe sustainability of this action has great potential, especially in the institutional sense, because of the fact that its results will have strong effect on easier and more quality work of different national, EU and CoE responsible bodies.

This matter becomes more difficult for PWFO who may face learning difficulties, discrimination, social exclusion. According to Eurostat, \u2018youth unemployment rates are generally double or more than double than the unemployment rates for all ages\u2019. (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics ) In 2014 about 5.1 million YP in EU were out of work, increased from 4.2 million in 2008. (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Labour_markets_at_regional_level) PWFO face daily problems of social integration, differences of culture, difficulty in financing their education and training, and as a result at risk of marginalisation. COPE objectives:- to promote EU values, diversity, social inclusion, inter-cultural and social dialogue;- to fight against long-term work/education/training inactivity;- to connect YP in Europe to Erasmus+ (E+) beneficiaries to exchange good practices, discuss opportunities, - to increase YP participation in community,- to connect YP with job centres and E+ sending/hosting organisations,- to motivate YPWFO to take part in a mobility project. Research (http://ec.europa.eu/youth/tools/documents/evs-impact_en.pdf ; http://www.europemobility.eu/download/Workshops/DIMITRIOU_Workshop_Impact.pdf ; ADICE-Europe Direct Roubaix from Nord-Pas-de-Calais' study) shows that PWFO taking part in a mobility projects become more confident, open-minded, improve their language skills, enhance their employability skills and in consequence, find jobs easier. The partnership is aware that not all YP and especially PWFO are aware of the existence of such projects and proposes  Target group: youth and especially YPWFO. The consortium realises that YPWFO need more/simplified/bespoke training than others to increase their employability skills, prepare for the departure in a mobility project and have equal chances in finding a job. It is also known that PWFO participating in a mobility project are likely to face a \u2018cultural shock\u2019 not only upon arrival in the receiving country, but also in making the transition back to the values of their community at home. Activities and results: To address these needs, the following tools will be created: - An online platform: will gather all the created tools and give YPWFO in Europe the opportunity to connect and exchange good practices, advice, practical information, as well to develop their network and to keep in touch with people after their mobility project. The platform will also be used by the YP to write articles, share photos during their project and testimony, keeping a track of their experience. - EU and European and international mobility grants - making EU and mobility understandable to all YP. - A guide helping YP in their project preparation: the guide will explain practical information (e.g. how to get a European Health Insurance Card), the life cycle of a mobility project and provide a list with links and free online materials (grammar, books, videos, vocabulary) helping the YPto improve their language skills.- Online training materials to enhance YPWFO soft skills and support acquisition (documents, links that people can use to prepare themselves before the departure). Impact: As previous participants and managers of mobility projects are aware, the importance of exchanging knowledge with peers is paramount. Connecting people and offering an online training, will not only develop engagement on E+ projects, but allow them to socialise and exchange on cultural diversity, debate about community subjects, cultural events, methods of working. The platform will also facilitate youth managers work while preparing YP before the departure. The participants will already have an overview and know what to generally expect from their future project. Through this platform they can also get in touch with other people during their project and make the integration easier and avoid the project failure. The partnership expects from this project to increase YPWFO soft skills, to address the lack of information regarding the mobility projects, to increase the number of YP taking part in a mobility project and in the community's activities and to increase their cultural and diversity awareness. On long term, more YP will become more participative, increase their acceptance regarding other culture, will find easier a job and contribute to the economic growth.
