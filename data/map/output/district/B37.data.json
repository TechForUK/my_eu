Automated processes for DNA analysis of large numbers of samples are now used in many of the EU member states; however the most efficient of these high throughput systems can take 3-5 days to produce DNA database-compliant profiles. In high profile crime and terrorism cases it is crucial to access DNA results promptly to provide intelligence to investigators. Currently a small number of samples can be processed in less than 24 h but the method is labour intensive and expensive. MiDAS proposes a real-time, simple-to-operate and cost effective alternative. MiDAS will build on the current expertise of the consortium to deliver a robust, reliable instrument adaptable to the needs of multiple EU agencies. The design will allow processing of small numbers of samples at the scene of a crime, in an office environment or in the laboratory. Samples will be directly introduced to the device; no further manual involvement will be required. DNA will be extracted using magnetic bead technology and transferred to reaction chambers for quantification and amplification which will be controlled to normalise the DNA profile. The profile will be visualised following analysis through on-cartridge DNA separation and laser induced fluorescence\u2013based detection. Automated data analysis using expert systems will facilitate the timely delivery of a profile. The requirements for implementation of the instrument into the forensic process will be determined, including an evaluation of relevant legislative and data protection requirements. Successful forensic validation of the instrument and subsequent validation of the full forensic process designed around the instrument will allow implementation of MiDAS to the forensic community within the partner EU member states, enabling the delivery of early DNA intelligence to law enforcement and security agencies.", 843258.0, 3961447.0, "MIDAS", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_95760_996281181"], ["7YE", "Integrated Design of Engineering Structures", "Uniper Technologies Limited", "This collaborative doctoral training programme provides a model for the development of technology leaders, enabling them to apply scientific methods from academia to interdisciplinary industrial design. The project is driven by the need for more efficient & lower emission engine systems. Heat exchangers in engines has been identified as a key enabling technology for low-emission power systems that is vital to the EU economy and is of great societal concern. Development of high-performance heat exchangers is a complex engineering challenge requiring academic contributions at the forefront of engineering science, which will enhance the EU\u2019s competitiveness by delivering economically and environmentally improved products. Having identified charge air cooling as a key enabling technology for low-emission power systems, here we propose an integrated approach to doctoral training in the area of engineering design leading to four doctorates covering diverse aspects of their mechanical engineering: structural vibration, stress & thermal analysis, additive manufacturing (AM), multifunctional metamaterials, fatigue & materials development. This project brings together a consortium of industrial and academic partners in a novel and bespoke doctoral training programme that is multi-disciplinary in its content and inter-sectoral with regards to the employability of the technology leaders of tomorrow. The programme provides a coherent training platform that inherently nurtures technical, creative and entrepreneurial skills. The central theme of Engineering Design within the programme enables us to build a training structure which is technically broad yet scientifically rigorous, while having the academic depth expected of a doctoral programme.
