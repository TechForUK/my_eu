The volume of leachate produced is increased by rainfall. It cannot be directly discharged to water courses as it contains many hazardous pollutants and therefore must be retained for treatment. This proposal contains details of the approach we will take to develop an automated, modular, mobile leachate treatment system. The treatment will be carried out directly in an advanced oxidation process that uses reactions at both the anode and the cathode of a new form of electrolytic cell that we will develop. Whilst current treatment methods can be expensive to install and maintain, may involve the use of chemicals and require permanent positioning at the landfill site, our apparatus will allow new treatment strategies to be used by the landfill operators. The automated, mobile system will offer a flexibility of operation that is not currently available. Cost savings will be made due to the reduced treatment time of our system, using reactions at the anode and cathode rather than the anode only. Additional savings can be made by the use of renewable energy to power the process. Electricity is the only resource required, hence wind or photovoltaic generation of power would allow operating costs to be minimised. With over 150,000 landfill sites across Europe, and an estimated annual spend of \u20ac 10-17 billion on leachate treatment, there is already a large market available. It is expected that leachate treatment will become a bigger industry as environmental Directives, aimed at improving the quality of EU water, are implemented. Landfill leachate producers will not be the only waste stream producers that could benefit from our apparatus.

The new European Bio-economy Strategy aims to increase the use of bio-based raw materials. Thus, large quantities of fertilisers will be required. Therefore, this project targets to produce sustainable soil improving products that can be easily handled, transported, and applied. BioEcoSIM will valorise livestock manure as an important example of valuable bio-waste into 1) pathogen-free, P-rich organic soil amendment (P-rich biochar), 2) slow releasing mineral fertilisers and 3) reclaimed water. By doing this, we will i) reduce negative environmental impacts (eutrophication of water bodies, and NH3 and N2O emissions) in intensive livestock regions, ii) help to decrease NH3 produced by the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process, (iii) mitigate EU\u2019s dependency on the depleting mineral sources for P-fertilisers, (iv) increase water efficiency use in agriculture and (v) support European Strategies and Directives, while generating economic benefits in the agriculture and bio-economy sector.\n\nThe project will combine three innovative technologies 1) superheated steam drying and non-catalytic pyrolysis to convert carbon in manure into P-rich biochar and syngas, 2) electrolytic precipitation of struvite and calcium phosphate and 3) selective separation and recovery of NH3 by gas-permeable membrane. Energy required in-process will be generated through combustion of syngas, thus reducing the pressure on finite fossil fuel. Water reclaimed from manure will be utilised for livestock production and/or irrigation. The sustainability of this approach will be validated against standards ISO14040 and ISO14044.

To do this, they developed a thermal processing unit that can take up to 100\u00a0kg/h of raw pig manure.\n\nAfter removing the solid biochar, researchers precipitated a mineral phosphate fertiliser mixture from the remaining liquid. Finally, they also recovered ammonia from the liquid using gas permeable membranes.\n\nThey have now built lab-scale units that integrate all three technologies, with the resulting products being biochar, gas, phosphorus, ammonia and reclaimed water. In this resource-efficient process, the gas will be used to help power the system while the water will be recycled for livestock or irrigation.\n\nBIOECOSIM's technology should reduce the amount of environmentally toxic surplus nutrients entering water systems in regions with high livestock intensities.

The 3DGoldSkills project was born within Arezzo\u2019s GOLD AND SILVER DISTRICT, which is one of the most traditional and historical sectors of Tuscan industry and that represents the Italian excellence in the world of jewellery. The current difficult economic situation, however, has resulted in a sharp change in the competitive landscape that had hitherto supported the growth of the sector. 3DGoldSkills aims at facing these issues by RAISING THE LEVELS OF DIFFERENTIATION AND INNOVATION within the industry. This will be possible through the YOUNG\u2019s training and specialization in the field of process and product innovation for the jewellery industry, as they will be able to support the companies\u2019 process of modernization (lacking of technology) as well as the process of development of advanced services, in order to compete in an evolving market increasingly invaded by competitors.\r\n3DGoldSkills aims at contributing to the increase of employability for students or young people who have recently completed a course of study in a professional school. This target will be achieved through two actions: students mobility and high school graduates mobility. The participating schools are professional-technical schools that have included in their curricula: courses related to chemistry applied to the gold sector (galvanic processes), courses related to rapid prototyping and new 3D technologies, courses related to design and art applied to the gold sector and to marketing / sales.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES.

In the medium term, the project also aims to facilitate the integration of mobility into national training systems, and also to promote the recognition of the knowledge and skills acquired during mobility through the attribution of valid credits. In this way, the project will contribute towards lifelong learning in the truest sense of the term, by ensuring that the resulting competence and enhanced employability will serve to reduce the risk of social and professional exclusion and, on the contrary, improve awareness of active European citizenship.\r\nThe participants selected will have clearly followed a training path relevant to the achievement of these objectives, but are currently facing difficulties as far as breaking into the job market is concerned. In order to remove this obstacle the participants need to acquire some form of competitive advantage, especially given the fact that the current scenario of socio-economic crisis in Europe is leading employers to further reduce the number of employees and, at the same time, make higher demands in terms of required qualifications. As a result, young people without access to a chance to develop key skills, to gain professional experience and to prepare themselves for entry into the market, may risk long-term unemployment or find themselves obliged to accept survival work which has nothing to do with their chosen career. In either case, this inevitably leads to frustration, and sometimes even to social and professional exclusion.\r\nTransnational mobility, promoted by a high quality project, creates added value in terms of employability by means of better language skills, not just for social integration but also for professional development, and by means of a clearer understanding of the European dimension of life and work in the future. Mobility brings citizens together, increases mutual understanding and tolerance and boosts confidence to face a world of instability, uncertainty and insecurity in relation to the near future. By providing valid, transparent, clearly-certified qualification which can be easily recognised by employers, mobility also increases the participants\u2019 levels of competitiveness and employability. \r\nThis project will therefore deliver a 13-week mobility programme for 70 young Portuguese citizens who have concluded vocational training, including those from disadvantaged social backgrounds. The project will include language preparation for all participants, adapted to their real communication needs, and will provide specific socio-cultural preparation so as to help develop intercultural competence. The language preparation organised by CEL will be teacher-led and will include the use of our own materials, specifically created for this purpose. At the end of the experience, the participants will be evaluated and given a language competence certificate issued in accordance with the C.E.F.R. for Languages and stating the contexts in which skills have been acquired. Following this preparatory stage, the participants will begin a 13-week work placement experience, seamlessly connected to their existing training path, certified in accordance with national vocational training legislation and clearly indicating the skills acquired and the performance level of each participant. Finally, these several forms of certification will be linked by Europass Mobility certification, clearly indicating to potential employers the content of the work placement and the knowledge and skills acquired, and will therefore demonstrate the capacity of the participant to take initiative in the construction of his own future career.  \r\nThe mobility experiences to be carried out under the terms of this project will occur between Sep. 2015 and June 2016 and will involve 21 partners from 8 member states of the EU, chosen for their proven competence in guaranteeing excellence in mobility and for their specialised knowledge of the specific professional sectors in which the participants wish to pursue their careers.

As the labor market becomes increasingly international, Europe, and thus also our country, needs education and training paths that fully respond to these challenges. One of the central ideas behind the European policies on lifelong learning is to ensure that international mobility becomes an integral part of education and vocational training. This would help learners to reach high level qualifications, fundamental for a first successful inclusion in the labor market or to the development and improvement of their careers. EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people to use the opportunities offered to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET programs are therefore the focus of this commitment and the EU Member States have recently set a target of allowing at least 6% of all learners in initial vocational training to complete a vocational training period abroad within 2020. In line with these objectives and European policies, through \"LEO quali-TC STRATEGY\", IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" and the other seven VET Schools involved, look at improving the quality of education and vocational training giving a European dimension to the educational paths and offering, as a result, the young participants the opportunity to test and deepen their skills and curriculum: professionalism in the specific areas of Tourism and Catering, cultural knowledge and language training. This general objective, in line with the ET2020 Strategy, is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of an internship abroad of 1 month for 96 students in initial vocational training and of 3 months for 64 recently graduated learners. The project intends to combine, also, the training period required by the new national legislation related the \u201cAlternanza Scuola-Lavoro\u201d (for a minimum of 400 hours in the last three years of school) to an internship abroad.On the base of the idea to continue to exploit the results of the LLP-LdV TOI Project \u201cLEO quali-TC\u201d (promoted by IPSSEOA \"Saffi\" in 2013 and recently completed), but also promoting the sustainability and enlargement Strategy of ECVET in the field of Tourism and Catering at national and European level, LEO-TC STRATEGY aims also to meet the needs of participating schools, trainers in the tourism and catering industry, companies and stakeholders of the Consortium, supporting and guiding them through the process of ECVET implementation, strengthening synergies and transitions between areas of formal and non formal learning, employment and entrepreneurship and ensuring better recognition of the skills and competencies acquired during periods of learning abroad.From the methodological point of view the project includes:- The continuous and active involvement of all the figures of the project staff and the supervision carried out by trainers and mentors; tutoring and mentoring activities; training methods based on the involvement, participation, the high integration between theory and practice, the development of practical skills immediately spendable, the validation of acquired skills;- A system of midterm and final means to monitor progress in terms of learning achieved by the participants, as well as to evaluate, certify, validate and transfer them within the ECVET framework;- The development of a final report focused on the identification of the effective functioning of the activities and elements that can be reproduced, transferred and integrated within the consortium and in other contexts.The following, therefore, the expected impacts:- Development of specialized skills of the target groups involved (160 young students and recent graduates);- Creation of models and training tools of innovative value;- Diffusion of results and training models among the subjects of the macro sectors concerned and vocational training - Availability of results and training models for institutions and professionals of the local / regional territories involved- Orientation of the public policies of the partners involved on the basis of the results of the project;- Use of procedures such as a standard model.", "http://WWW.geckoprogrammes.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004985_4"], ["9RU", "Arte, Cultura e Turismo Oggi", "GECKO PROGRAMMES LIMITED", 50770.0, "With the advent of digital technology in the tourism and culture sector, new professionals have been created. It is crucial that when training young people we give them some transversal competences coupled with cultural education at European level. Young people need the right mix of professional skills, including entrepreneurial skills and language skills, and transversal skills (eg. Problem solving), see market research ItaliaCreativa. ACTO is committed to ensuring the attainment of the 8 transversal skills defined by Europe, needed by  young people in the tourism and culture sector to sustain a job. Training on entrepreneurial skills and employability skills with work-based training will make young people more employable in Italy and Europe.The project also aims to make the participants more modern, innovative, flexible and attractive to the labor market. This formal, non-formal and work based training, triggers positive changes in terms of self-esteem, language skills, flexibility and organizational skills.The project tackles the reduction of  young people being unemployment and gives the participants entrepreneurial skills increasingly required by the labour market and to obtain a qualified job and the understanding of continuous learning.This project will improve, strengthen and expand the skills and competences acquired in theory, with a work-placement of 22 days in a company in England or Spain. Whiles being abroad on a mobility they  will improve their language skills and understand new ways to make them more flexible, open-minded and open towards innovation and modernisation. The training will start in Italy, with a preparatory stage where the participant obtains competences on how to present yourself in an interview, some coaching on addressing difficult situations and some communication techniques to better deal with their experience abroad. Also, a Personal Development Plan (Individual development plan -IDP) will be created that identifies the aspirations and objectives of the participants including an action plan to achieve them. The group of participants will have at their disposal a Coacher, a Placement Coordinator, a Company Tutor and a Mobility Manager.There will be 3 flows, of which 2 groups for England, of 7 Participants + 1 Accompanying person, and a group for Spain, 8 participants + 1 AP. The flows will be of 22 days, in the fields of tourism, events, culture, art and administration. The mobility is preceded by a period of training in Italy. The admission requirements: to have completed secondary education, age between 18 and 28 years, inclusive, possibly to be enrolled in one of our VET courses, mainly residents in the province of Chieti or in other neighboring provinces of Abruzzo.  They should be willing and able to spend 22 days abroad and open to learn new skills.

The foreign experience also encourages collaboration between different countries and the value of European citizenship.The project promotes collaboration between the different agencies and also offers a period of training for the staff, with job-shadowing. The hope is to also create skilled staff who are comparable to the different European training systems and create new training programmes and projects in the future, where the inclusion of cultures, religions, socio-cultural aspects and needs of the labour market are based on the innovative training methods.The impact on the territory is expected to be on different levels, producing benefits to the participants, their families, the place where they live and training institutions, and therefor will contribute to the understanding of the importance of life long learning and the benefits of European citizenship.", "http://WWW.geckoprogrammes.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-004995_9"], ["9TG", "PRO.CO.DE.-PROfessional COmpetences for local Development", "CPN Systems Limited", 283186.0, "PRO.CO.DE.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased

Working and studying in other countries must be made easy for both the school\u2019s students and teachers. \r\nThis project is geared towards the students and teachers at NEXT who wish to go abroad to further improve upon their competencies, especially in connection with language and culture. This opportunity provides a chance for many students to develop their personal competencies as well and, perhaps, to get the motivation to go abroad for even longer periods later in their educations. \r\n\r\nNEXT as an institution will create a clear international profile that will make a difference. Therefore, NEXT feels obligated to ensure that its teaching staff is kept up to date on international demands within individual professional disciplines and methodologies. To do so and to ensure quality teaching, there is a continuous need for employee training at the school.
