By employing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) to liquefy and store cryogens, CryoHub will balance the power grid, while meeting the cooling demand of a refrigerated food warehouse and recovering the waste heat from its equipment and components.\nThe intermittent supply is a major obstacle to the RES power market. In reality, RES are fickle forces, prone to over-producing when demand is low and failing to meet requirements when demand peaks. Europe is about to generate 20% of its required energy from RES by 2020, so that the proper RES integration poses continent-wide challenges.\nThe Cryogenic Energy Storage (CES), and particularly the Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), is a promising technology enabling on-site storage of RES energy during periods of high generation and its use at peak grid demand. Thus, CES acts as Grid Energy Storage (GES), where cryogen is boiled to drive a turbine and to restore electricity to the grid. To date, CES applications have been rather limited by the poor round trip efficiency (ratio between energies spent for and retrieved from energy storage) due to unrecovered energy losses.\nThe CryoHub project is therefore designed to maximise the CES efficiency by recovering energy from cooling and heating in a perfect RES-driven cycle of cryogen liquefaction, storage, distribution and efficient use. Refrigerated warehouses for chilled and frozen food commodities are large electricity consumers, possess powerful installed capacities for cooling and heating and waste substantial amounts of heat. Such facilities provide the ideal industrial environment to advance and demonstrate the LAES benefits.\nCryoHub will thus resolve most of the above-mentioned problems at one go, thereby paving the way for broader market prospects for CES-based technologies across Europe.", 1912418.0, 7186916.0, 5, 15, "CryoHub", null, "http://www.lsbu.ac.uk", null, "h2020_199618_999911309"], [1480550400000, 1543536000000, "Rapid Integrity Assessment of Flexible Risers for Offshore Oil and Gas Installations", "London South Bank University Lbg", "This action will bring to market a unique product, RiserSure\u2122, for assessing the condition of flexible riser pipes widely used in offshore oil and gas production.

The Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010 prompted very recent new safety legislation in the US and Europe (2015 US offshore safety drilling rule, 2013 EU Offshore Safety Directive). This is driving the uptake of non-destructive testing (NDT) to monitor riser condition.\nCurrent techniques cannot reliably or efficiently assess flexible riser condition to provide advance warning of failure.

The two main groups internally that contribute are the staff in the wider enterprise/careers team and the academic staff engaged with enterprise and business partners. It is rare for people in these groups to have genuine entrepreneurial experience, as by nature entrepreneurs are more likely to work independently. However, there is demand for this experience to greatly improve the impact, efficacy and functioning of the enterprise and entrepreneurship provision and wider engagement in the ecosystem.

The learning it offers will have wide and long-term impact on their organisation, those within it and the wider community.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are to deliver clear understanding and practical experience for staff involved in the ecosystem that can positively impact their work, make it more relevant, appropriate, engaging and impactful for everyone involved. The Training Programme will also improve the profile and attraction of roles in enterprise education and therefore improve recruitment, and retention of high quality staff. Our objective branches to include improving skills, competencies, qualities and capacity for innovation to all staff involved. \r\nAdditionally, ETEE will work with external target groups (staff in VET providers, incubators/accelerators) to extend the impact into the ecosystem beyond HEIs. \r\n\r\nWe aim to engage indirectly with 1000 beneficiaries across the ecosystem, and achieve this through consultation and feedback activities, training activities, a combined Communication and Dissemination Plan, a significant Exploitation Plan, 4 Multiplier Events and activation of our joint networks together with momentum generated around the ETEE project itself.

In recent years, as traditional social structures have weakened, the role of the school has become even more relevant in this respect.  Developing the 'whole child' has become more important than the traditional focus on  delivering a narrow curriculum of pure, academic subjects.  Meanwhile, concern about the health and well-being of Europe's citizens is growing as economists note the financial implications of an increasingly less active, less healthy, longer living population.  Our 'obesity crisis' is repeatedly referenced as a future economic risk to European success.  \r\n\r\nBringing together these 2 issues is the focus of our project.  How can educators develop the traditional role of schools to focus more firmly on Health and Well - Being and ensure we foster positive, 'inclusive' experiences of physical education and healthy eating?  How can schools encourage positive attitudes in all pupils and set them on a path to fitness for life and a healthier, more productive future?  \r\n\r\nThe task begins with up-skilling current and future teachers to lead the attitudinal change we require from all educational sectors.  This project seeks to do that by bringing together a number of high achieving schools, aware of this need to 'educate for life', as well as Universities with a Teacher Training remit--including a focus on training Physical Education teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe partnership consists primarily of a University and 2 schools in each of three countries--the UK,  Spain and Greece.  (An additional partner of a University based fitness facility adds additional expertise and resources to complement the other UK partners and  bring the total number in the partnership to 10.)  \r\n\r\nThe group have agreed a 2 year work-plan of collaboration in order to exchange knowledge, bring more focus to the Pupil Health & Well - Being agenda and develop joint resources.   4  joint,  transnational meetings  and a program of on-going  local activities to strengthen education are planned.  Joint activities between the schools and Universities involved will be supported.  \r\n\r\nOngoing research, knowledge sharing, the development of resources and dissemination & evaluation will all take place as the partnership work together to develop 6 training modules, which the 3 University partners have agreed to incorporate into their future teacher training.  The modules will focus on teaching and learning styles, behavioral change, cultural influence and inclusion in schools, as well as more traditional aspects of physical education.

This annual course will be advertised on the EU Erasmus + Key Action 1 course database and be self-funding, with each of the 3 countries involved hosting it in turn and with a transnational partnership cohort delivering.  \r\n\r\nAll lesson plans and resources produced by the project will be offered free to those who take part, as well as generally via the project web site, which will be funded to continue for a minimum of 5 additional years.\r\n\r\nThe schools involved are high achieving and focused on 'education for life'. Many of them succeed in areas with high levels of deprivation.  The Universities are all long standing trainers of future teachers with different approaches to the tutoring of general teachers as well as specifically to the development of future Physical Education teachers.  We want to combine these approaches to develop the most coherent training possible for current and future teachers, allowing them to begin the process of expanding the remit of their teaching and their schools to focus more effectively on establishing healthy patterns of living.

Also, the school\u2019s high prioritization of internationalizing students helps to strengthen their professional profiles, as well as their personal and intercultural competencies.   \r\n\r\nFor the second time, we include ECVET in our mobility project.\r\nThis involves the prepared \u201dMemorandum of Understanding\u201d, which is signed by our partners and us and is attached to this application.\r\nWe have also attached the \u201dLearning Agreement\u201d form, which we will use to formalize the commitment of our partner, the student and us in connection with the forthcoming mobility initiatives.\r\n\u201dUnits of Learning Outcome\u201d will be agreed upon in advance in each circumstance and attached to the \u201cLearning Agreement\u201d document.\r\nWhich competencies students will obtain in the course of each mobility initiative will be drawn up in a \u201cTranscript of Records\u201d and attached to the student\u2019s EuroPass Mobility certificate.\r\n\r\nThis application covers:\r\n   68   VET student work programs\r\n   17   HG student work programs\r\n 120  HG-EUX student language and work programs\r\n   38   HHX and HTX student language and work programs \r\n\r\n 17   accompanying teachers\r\n 22   teacher work or training programs \r\n\r\nWe expect programs to run during the entire project period, as we also expect to incorporate programs in different European countries. The needs and wishes of individual students and teachers are considered in determining destinations. Most often, students and teachers have a good idea of where they can be challenged appropriately and obtain relevant professional inspiration.  \r\n\r\nThis project is expected to strengthen the school\u2019s international work. The participation of more people in training abroad will set greater focus on internationalization in general. CPH WEST expects that a number of teachers and counselors will become more motivated to work actively on this front, using this opportunity to include international projects in their teaching.

The person receiving care is often a parent but can be a sibling, grandparent or other relative who is disabled, has some chronic illness, mental health problem or other condition connected with a need for care, support or supervision.Although research has provided clear evidence that heavy caring responsibilities can result in emotional difficulties, health problems, social exclusion, and limited opportunities for social and leisure activities, professional support services are lacking in many EU countries. This is largely due to the fact that the youth work, educational and social services sectors are not aware of this group. However, it can be seen from the UK experience that young carers are a large and important group that youth services need to address.The main result expected after completion of the project is that each of the six partner organizations and several hundred other interested stakeholders will have access to a set of tools and interventions, together with the skills and capacities to use them, to support young carers. Such tools will include questionnaires, motivational interviews, checklists, services navigators, etc. In addition, the creation of practical support services will be promoted through practical guidelines based on a model support project established by each partner in their region.The tools are intended to allow identification of young carers; to allow practitioners to assess the situation of young carers, including measuring the level and impact of the care burden; and to allow practitioners to develop an action plan to address issues adversely affecting young carers.

In Europe there are more than 50,000 broiler breeders who are facing a major problem concerning control of air- and insect-borne pathogens in their broiler houses, which results in high infection rates of the broiler flocks. This is partly caused by insects \u2013 especially flies \u2013 entering the broiler house through the ventilation system. The Airpath project seeks to solve this problem by developing a new type of barrier based on electrostatic precipitation. This is a known technology used in larger applications where cost is not a major concern such as chimneys on power plants. Hence, the technology must be further developed, scaled and adapted to the specific needs of the European broiler industry. Background of the project The project seeks to solve one of the major challenges that the poultry sector is facing concerning airborne pathogens. An example is Campylobacter which is a major problem in broiler houses (and in the consumer product). At certain times of the year (the warmer months) the breeders experience a rise of infection to more than 60-80% of the flocks. A previous study by DTU Veterinary Institute in Denmark has demonstrated that a major source of the infections is flies entering the houses through the ventilation system. DTU has demonstrated that by effectively keeping the flies out of the broiler houses, the number of infected populations will be drastically reduced. Using simple fly screens it was possible to reduce the infection rate to 15% of the flocs in the problematic period, whereas control populations not using screens showed more 50% infection rate.", 209328.0, 3393175.0, 7, 12, "AIRPATH", null, "http://www.poultry.uk.com", null, "fp7_94939_995014070"]]}, "fts": {"data": [[2017, "STIRLING ASSYNT (EUROPE) LIMITED", 29308.0, "Support expenditure for the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) (21.01.04.04)", "fts_2017_62180"]]}}, "0SU": {"cordis": {"data": [[1451606400000, 1546214400000, "Adoptive Gateways for dIverse muLtiple Environments", "Canonical Group Limited", "AGILE project aims to create an open, flexible and widely usable IoT solution at disposal of industries (startups, SMEs, tech companies) and individuals (researchers, makers, entrepreneurs) as a framework that consists of:\n\u2022 A modular IoT gateway enabling various types of devices (wearables, home appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.) to be connected with each other and to the Internet;\n\u2022 Data management and device control maximizing security and privacy, at local level and in the cloud, technologies and methodologies to better manage data privacy and ownership in the IoT;\n\u2022 Support of various open and private clouds;\n\u2022 Recommender and visual developer\u2019s interfaces enabling easy creation of applications to manage connected devices and data;\n\u2022 Support of mainstream IoT/M2M protocols, and SDKs from different standardization bodies for device discovery and communication;\n\u2022 Two separate gateway hardware versions: a) the \u2018maker\u2019s version, based on the popular RaspberryPi platform for easily prototyping and attracting the current community; b) the \u2018industrial\u2019 version for more industrial and production-ready applications; \n\u2022 An ecosystem of IoT applications shareable among users and developers leveraging on existing initiatives by key stakeholders in this domain, like Canonical and Ubuntu Snappy IoT ecosystem.\nPiloted in relevant open areas (fields and in a port) for field & cattle monitoring through drones, air quality & pollution monitoring and in smart retail, AGILE will be easily adaptable and usable in different contexts serving as an horizontal technology for fast IoT prototyping and engineering in different domains.

There are just over 500 VET learners at the school, 20 permanently employed staff and around 60 employees who are contracted to work with teaching and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project for staff is to gain more knowledge about EU cooperation and to obtain a greater insight into the overall objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy for Higher Vocational Education. More knowledge is needed about how ECVET should be applied regarding the transfer of credits & qualifications and also insight into how this is done in other parts of Europe concerning the professional roles that VET learners at Frans Schartau are educated for. Additional aims are to learn how the curriculum could better reflect the European dimension and the development of technology within teaching. The aim of the project for VET learners is to give them work experience abroad as well as an opportunity to strengthen their language skills, which is a request made by the labour market. As a result of mobility, employability increases and at the same time VET learners enhance their opportunities for working in an international labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will be organised by three members of staff who have previous experience of international cooperation. Activities are well established and methods for running the project have been planned for some time.

Staff should be in a position that enables them to apply their new knowledge immediately for the benefit of VET learners and to support the school\u2019s own work with internationalisation. The 31 VET learners participating each year will be selected to achieve a good spread across these four areas of work. Learners should have good interpersonal skills and a clearly stated goal for what they hope to achieve in their future careers with the help of this new experience. Participants must also have good communicative skills to be able to convey what they have learnt after their period of WPL. After selection, the goals for mobility should be agreed and anchored with the host company or organisation and the Learning Agreement written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anticipated result is that Frans Schartau will be at the forefront when it comes to internationalisation. There will be a greater understanding of professional roles seen from a European perspective. This knowledge will add an international dimension to the school\u2019s programmes and teaching. New knowledge will be generated concerning technology, not least the knowledge needed to continue providing relevant and high quality Work Placement (WPL) abroad. As the school is a part of the City of Stockholm, where all levels of education are provided, results can be spread via the municipality\u2019s Intranet and newsletters.

In these learning models the role of guidance is essential. In the model of this project we utilise also the perspectives of students and companies, because then the perspective of customer guides the planning and enables to create an qualitative customer oriented educational service product.AIMSThe wide aims of this project are- to improve the learning outcomes of work-placement by utilizing eLearning platform as learning and guiding environment- to increase co-operation of schools and companies by offering companies a tool with possibility to familiarise student to the company before the work-placement and help companies to improve company\u2019s familiarizing material more learning friendlyThe concrete aims of the project are1) to create a eLearning platform (tentatively Moodle used by Helmi), a. where student planning for work placement abroad can familiarize beforehand to relevant vocational skills demonstration material, to work placement abroad in general, to practical matters of work placement company and to receive personal guidance during work-placement period 24/7.b. In the same platform work placement instructor can meet the student and guiding teacher beforehand and create company\u2019s familiarizing material (e.g. videos, interviews) to eLearning platform in co-operation with teacher and student.c. Teacher can produce material to eLearning platform, guide student in work placement tasks and support work place instructor 24/7.2) to plan and build to eLearning platform a pedagogical guidance model which supports the work placement abroad, including e.g. material production, guidance, evaluation and  collecting feedback.NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR PROFILETo this project participate the following foreign companies and schools:Scancoming Spain, ESP; Fasada Incoming, ESP; Laventeli, FRA; Scancoming London, GB;  Banbury Museum, GB; Koning Willem I College, NL; Collegi Badalones, ESP; RWS, DE. To activities participate 60 1-3. class travel&tourism and business students and 20 teachers and eLearning experts. MAIN ACTIVITIESIn the beginning of the project all the project members fill an questionnaire where we try to map the present state of guidance and expectations to improve them. In autumn 2016 we plan and create an eLearning platform and content to it (general practices in work-placement abroad, vocational skills demonstration, eLearning guidance model (24/7), familiarizing material of companies). During their work-placement, guidance of the student will be done by job instructor of the company and guiding teacher who will visit student once and guide her in other times by eLearning platform 24/7. During visits to partner companies and schools guiding teachers discuss with job instructors and person in charge of partner school about the state of familiarising students to company\u2019s customs and success of guidance and plans to improve them. After first year of the project, summary meeting will take place, where we evaluate the results of Questionnaire 1-2 and the results of discussions with partner companies and schools, and make the plan for 2. year of the project (improvement). After second year, in the end of project in final summary meeting, we evaluate the results of all questionnaires and discussions and the fulfillments of aims of the project.RESULTS AND IMPACTS:A) Students: During two years 60 students will perfom work-placment abroad in professional and innovative company. The skills of student improve significantly, because with the help of eLearning platform: she has familiarized to work-placement company before work-placement, she has been able to ensure learning objectives while working and she has had chance to receive guidance 24/7.B) Partner companies: They have received concrete help, equipment and benefit with the help of eLearning and guidance model showing how to familiarize students to company. The guiding skills and eLearning skills of job instructor have improved.

According to Nyoni and Serageldin (2005)  youth employment is a global priority for sustainability, peace and prosperity and in their essay they describe a project on equitable employment for the future as it relates to \u201cPrinciple 10: Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development.\r\n \r\nMore to that end, a global movement called the Youth Employment Summit (YES) Campaign has been created to work with all concerned stakeholders to implement the MDGs of the United Nations through its 75 YES Country Networks. About 1500 young people from 150 countries launched a Decade Campaign of Action in Alexandria, Egypt at the first Youth Employment Summit in 2002 so that young adults, especially young women facing poverty, will be engaged in educational, technical and vocational training programmes that will then give them the skills and capacity to create productive and sustainable livelihoods for themselves and their communities. \r\n\r\nEconomic: Youth face higher unemployment than any other demographic. Youth make up the majority of the enrolled in TVET courses. Therefore, it seems like a natural fit for TVET courses to use one disparity to counteract the other. Young people aged 15 to 24 represent nearly half the world's jobless although they are only 25 per cent of the working age population, and halving world youth unemployment rate would add at least $2.2 trillion to global gross domestic product (GDP) equal to around 4 per cent of the 2003 value, according to a new ILO analysis - Global Employment Trends for Youth 2004.\r\nEnvironmental: Because the youth in TVET are learning working habits that will be carried on throughout their working lives it is important that sustainability issues are adequately addressed in curricula to instill environmental-friendly work habits. \r\n\r\nSocial: Using TVET to create sustainable livelihoods can combat feelings of despair and desperation among youth. Integrating life-skills into TVET can help youth to: cope with daily struggles, integrate into their community/society, decrease criminality, etc. \r\n\r\nNon formal education methods and approaches will be actively used during the whole program and participants will be in the center of program by sharing experiences, contributing the program. Simulations, group works, peer to peer learning, discussion, field visits are example of methodologies that will be used. \r\n\r\nTrainers and invited experts will share their experiences and knowledge with participants in order to reach the project and objectives. Beside the thematic aspect, the project will create unique opportunity to establish future cooperation between NGOs from different part of Europe. \r\n\r\nOutcomes: \r\nFollow up by cooperation with local governments through the partners\r\nEnlargement of YES Campaign \r\nTo have more NGOs involved in environmental issues and working on social entrepreneurship on  environmental issues. \r\nMore active young people promoting UN Sustainable Development Goals.", "http://www.worldviewimpact.org", "Worldview Impact Foundation", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035180_coordinator"], [2017, "Sail With EntrepreneurShip", "Worldview Impact Foundation", 18986.0, 7, 7, "According to the Eurostat statistics youth unemployment rate in Europe in July 2014 was 21.7 % in the EU-28.

They will be able to bring new ideas to their workplace.Locations: host institutions of the Ecett network, which has more than 2,000 places of potential courses in Europe.The method MECETT has been described, tested and transferred from two projects funded by Leonardo da Vinci: \"Ecett\u2010Pilot 2006\u00bb and \u00abEcett transfer of Innovation 2009\u00bb and funded by the ESF: \u00abEcett\u2010Convergence 2009\u00bb.\" This learning process is benchmarking, research and description of good practices that can be transferred to other parts of the network. Evaluations reveal that 87% of training objectives have been achieved and that these exchanges have a concrete impact on how trainees think, speak and work after their course.

Since 2006, Ecett help desks  have accompanied more than 600 students, and hosts to follow the MECETT procedures.Students involve their team and management since the phase of preparation of their course (negotiation of learning objectives). Ecett \u00abTraining Files\u00bb  are personal notebooks (data identification of trainees and their hosts, objectives of learning, conventions of training, planning, individual budgets, assessment of experience, good practices)..Three months before their departure, the students are accompanied by their Helpdesk to identify the organism (the host) with relevant expertise to the target problem. They will leave in groups of three or four  to get a critical mass for impact on their return. Return: meeting of team/manager to report, orally and in writing, their main ideas and good practices.5 EXPECTED IMPACTS : AT THREE LEVELS:-transversal and specific impacts on the trainee himself-impact on the Organization / the team, on return-impacts on the target public  = service users = young people accompanied by these professionals and learners6.

Workers leave on observation traineeships and practical work, especially, but in seminars also and other trainings. Framed by the MECETT method, these workers will encounter peers who have the same difficulties, who do the same work and who have found other answers. In observing, comparing and discussing with their peers, they will be able to report and describe best practices in the various countries of the European network. Upon their return, these workers will work with their team and responsible to implement the elements of interest, create a new project or simply to improve their existing practices. This approach will be assessed by the competent Department of research and development of Trempoline in order to measure the impact on the beneficiaries.

The \"Compagnons du Devoir\" are the source of inspiration and the Agency Leonardo da Vinci (EU) helped to transfer this model to continuing education in all types of trades.\r\nThe tradition of learning of artisans can be adapted and transferred to the ongoing training of all professionals. Learning excellence requires not only of new theoretical knowledge, but especially the acquisition of new practical skills based on experimentation and observation of good models of Knowledge in the field... The transfer of companionship to the PD model assumes certain adaptations to meet the needs of adult professionals who occupy a function and have private or family commitments.

Instead of only talking about the theories of equality, freedom, inclusion, the method lets participants reflect on whether their actions reflect their theories.  Through interactive activities combined with reflection sessions, participants gain a deeper understanding of themselves and a greater awareness of their effect on others.  They learn to recognize their own needs and how to express these needs in a group, as well as what to do when there are conflicting needs in a group.

We hope to further promote a love for learning languages by adding a third European language to our curriculum: German.As such, we need to develop our staff\u2019s non specialist language so that all members of the faculty (6 in total) are able to teach additional languages to higher levels, giving us greater flexibility in terms of what we can offer to our students. Not being native speakers of the languages we teach, all members of the faculty also need to update and develop our cultural knowledge and embed culture into teaching, integrating authentic materials into schemes of work. This is of particular relevance given the updated national curriculum for languages at Key Stage 3, and the revised specifications for GCSE and A Level. We also want to learn from good practice in our European partner countries regarding teaching and learning of foreign languages, developing new teaching methodologies.As part of our wider vision, alongside this project, we want to develop international links with a view to arranging, as part of a future phase of development, pupil visits to Spain and France, leading to an increase in uptake of languages and a widening of students\u2019 aspirations.A further objective is to increase the overall attainment of Special Educational Need (SEN) students, with a view to encouraging these students to pursue the study of foreign languages at a higher level. The development of the teaching assistants within our faculty through participation in this training is central to this aim.For this project, we plan to send members of our MFL faculty to Spain, France and Germany over a period of two years to take part in training courses which include intensive language learning, cultural activities, teaching ideas and methodology, resource gathering and sharing, and developing links with a view to establishing closer engagement and exchanges with a French/Spanish school in the future.This will lead to an expansion in the provision of languages available to our students, giving pupils more choice.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in foreign countries and gain valuable experience which can\u2019t be acquired by other means. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields is difficult and students have had problems finding apprenticeships in Iceland. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to make sure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to stay abreast of things regarding development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, six students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for four to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nVocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad.

In this application 74 students are applying for 14 day group study trips. It also includes application for six teachers to escort student groups. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers, at least during the first few days while they are getting to know a new environment. In one of the groups applying, one student is in a wheelchair and the application is also for two accompanying persons for 14 days each. \r\n\r\nIt is also important for the teachers and staff of TCR to learn how study programmes for specialisations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad.

TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programmes to meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. Among new study programmes that have been developed at the school to this purpose are a programme in web development and design, a new study programme in technology and science for exceptional students that was set up in cooperation with Reykjavik University, and a completely restructured design programme now named the Design and Innovation programme where design and arts are intertwined with studies in traditional vocational fields.

The vision for European aviation is shaped by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe in the Flight Path 2050 goals, which define stringent regulations on pollutant emissions. To meet these goals, the major engine manufacturers develop lean premixed combustors operated at very high pressure. This development introduces a large risk for reduced reliability and lifetime of engines: pressure oscillations in the combustor called thermoacoustics. Much research has been dedicated to study this phenomenon over the last decades with mixed success. Industrial experience shows that the pressure oscillations often surface as late as the full engine has been built and tested. Traditional engineering methods fall short of predictability during the design of the engines due to a high sensitivity of thermoacoustics with respect to barely known input parameters.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

Both La Touline and Drive Forward support young people coming out of the care system and empower them to become engaged and productive members of society. The statistics in both countries are alarming: almost 40% of those sleeping rough on the streets of France and the UK have a background in care; care leavers are over-represented in prisons; they suffer disproportionally from mental health problems; and in the UK almost 40% of young care leavers are not in employment, education or training. Counteracting the negative effects of a childhood spent in care is at the heart of our work: preventing the continuing process of exclusion through a holistic support framework to achieve long-term social inclusion.\r\n\r\nThe two organisations first met during an Erasmus+ capacity building programme, which saw delegates from Apprentis d\u2019Auteuil visit various organisations in the UK to share and improve best practice in supporting care-experienced youth.

The project revolves around three key activities: 1) Preparation: For most participants, travelling to a foreign country (but also within their respective countries) is a new and often unthought-of experience. The prospect of going abroad for the first time can be just as daunting as it is exciting. As the main drivers of the project, individuals are expected to face up to the bureaucratic as well as practical challenges involved with the process of organising a journey. 2) Project activity and travel experience: The project revolves around participants producing visual and audio testimonials acting as a platform to communicate their own personal experiences and perspectives. The exchange is further underpinned by cultural visits and group activities to enlarge individual\u2019s horizons and foster positive dynamics between participants. 3) Showcasing and broadcasting: To finalise the project participants will develop a PR and communications plan laying out how the artistic results are being shared across various channels with a public audience.\r\n\r\nPutting individual participants into the centre of the project, the Youthpass evaluation tool is used throughout the project to track individuals\u2019 non-formal learning process and support their personal development.\r\n\r\n\u00abWitness to your life \u00bb will have a multifarious impact on each project participant, increasing their self-esteem and boosting individuals\u2019 confidence, whilst equipping them with valuable life skills from communication and negotiation, to independent learning, problem solving and dealing with stress and conflict as a team. At the same time, by spending time in different socio-cultural environment and learning about other peoples\u2019 perspectives, participants gain a more positive and inclusive image of \u201cEurope\u201d and its essential values of solidarity, diversity and friendship amongst its people.

In that context, it is necessary not only to continuously monitor the environment, equipment, systems and processes, but also to sense occupants\u2019 behaviour inside and outside the building and provide timely response and feedback.\nThe proposal will tackle the above challenges through several routes: (1) new information-driven sensor designs that connect technology with people and information; (2) new Internet-of-Everything based communications protocols for seamless distributed detection and estimation; (iii) intelligent data processing.", 3925.0, 749756.0, 8, 11, "SENSIBLE", null, null, null, "h2020_206767_925963359"]]}}, "8RQ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "E.A.S.Y.

The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y.

The project idea originates from the constant contact and confrontation with students, recent graduates, VET staff, companies, stakeholders and public and private Institutions.The strong information activity on the learning and mobility opportunities offered by European Programs, carried out at national level, through seminars, infodays and meetings, permitted  Essenia UETP srl to understand the needs of the job market and the education world as well. Starting from this confrontation and sensitization activity, a need analysis has been carried out. It made it clear, then, that the tourist sector is one of the greatest factors of development: although it is historically and structurally relevant in the local and in the Italian context, it still needs to be strenghtened  by means of updated  and reinforced professional competences for the recent graduates and the staff of VET organisations. Carrying out traineeships and training abroad represents a way of acquiring such competences. To guarantee the compliance of the project with the needs observed and to contribute to make the competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market, Essenia has been strenghtening its network of local partners, reinforcing also the collaboration with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the formal and informal competences (ECVET).Besides the acquisition of professional competences related to the touristic sector, the project contributes to strenghten the  European identity and to enhance linguistic and intercultural competences, developing in the participants a set of personal and transversal skills  which are indispensable to be included in an increasingly globalized and constantly evolving  job market. Therefore, Essenia has planned to realize, during the linguistic and cultural preparation phase, linguistic training courses aimed at reinforcing the knowledge of the sectorial languages. The partnership of the project is composed by organizations with whom Essenia has solid relationships, as well as new members, included to favour Essenia's European and international dimension. In the project Portugal has been identified as one of the Countries with which to activate sinergies, according to the internationalization strategy.

The domestic sector is of major significance, as it will reduce reliance on large centralized energy plants. There are several domestic options including solar thermal, solar electric, heat pump and biomass systems. Of these, solar and heat pump technologies have the widest potential application as they require no physical feedstock. However, despite steady market growth, these technologies still make up only a small fraction of total household energy supply. One of the main reasons for this is the initial investment required, coupled with uncertainty over return on investment. This is compounded by the huge range of available products and a lack of objective information relating to system performance.  As a result, consumers are often confused and unable to make informed decisions. In addition, installation companies often experience difficulties when advising customers on the various options and their respective benefits. Hence, despite considerable technological advancements in terms of system performance and efficiency, there exists a significant knowledge and confidence barrier that restricts increased market acceptance.  In order to address this problem, we propose to develop a system that can automatically provide accurate and objective information about the suitability of a renewable energy technology for a given user scenario. The system will be intuitive and easy to use employing a unique dynamic grading technology.

The outputs from this project will be translated, through the Big Idea, into a methodology for youth-led accountability that youth organisations can use to develop a shared, deep understanding of youth-led accountability and reach consensus on how youth-led monitoring of SDGs can be effected and governments can integrate into their processes of implementing and monitoring the SDGs.There are three objectives:\u2022 Build the capacity of youth-led Community Based Organisations (CBOs) to hold governments to account effectively;\u2022 Demonstrate how young people can lead, or partner with others in, the monitoring of the SDGs;\u2022 Promote the exchange of good practice and foster increased sect oral coordination and North-South cooperation.The project will build the capacity of 20 young leaders from youth-led CBOs in 7 countries to become \u2018Accountability Advocates.\u2019 They will be trained utilising a Post-2015 Youth-Led Monitoring & Accountability toolkit, which capitalises on Restless Development\u2019s peer-to-peer, non-formal methodology, and supported through a mentorship scheme. Advocates will be supported to convene national alliances for the development of youth-led frameworks for monitoring the implementation of the SDGs, and provide assistance to national delegations to the UN Summit for Adoption of Post-2015 Development Agenda on youth-led accountability.

During the project, new members are expected to join the Initiative.\n\nThe Joint Programme of Activities (JPA) of DoReMi includes: (i) a Joint Programme of Research (JPR) covering the issues outlined above and providing an overview of the needs for research infra-structures of pan-European interest and facilitating multilateral initiatives leading to better use and development of research infrastructures; (ii) a Joint Programme of Integration (JPI) to develop a coor-dinated European roadmap for the long term needs of the key players in Europe; and (iii) a Joint Pro-gramme for the Spreading of Excellence (JPSE), covering knowledge management, training and mo-bility and its implementation. The JPR focuses on the areas identified by the HLEG as the most prom-ising in terms of addressing/resolving the key policy questions, namely: the shape of dose response curve for cancer, individual susceptibilities and non-cancer effects. Radiation quality, tissue sensitivity and internal exposures will be addressed as cross cutting themes within the three main research areas. A substantial proportion of the JPA will be dedicated to the joint programme of research. The pro-gramme describes a multidisciplinary approach including interfaces with the broader biological toxico-logical and epidemiological communities. Strategic planning will be carried out in close collaboration with MELODI. The long term Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) will be developed by MELODI, whereas DoReMi research priorities are based on a shorter term Transitional Research Agenda (TRA), focusing on goals that are feasible to achieve within the 6 year project and areas where barriers need to be removed in order to proceed with the longer term strategic objectives.", 104814.0, 17592991.0, 16, 38, "DOREMI", "http://www.doremi-noe.net/", "http://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england", "/docs/results/images/2015/158728.jpg", "fp7_94439_999453178"], [1293840000000, 1451520000000, "Stem Cells for Relevant Efficient Extended and Normalized Toxicology", "Public Health England an Executive Agency of the Dept of Health", "In the development of products for use by humans it is vital to identify compounds with toxic properties at an early stage of their development, to avoid spending time and resource on unsuitable and potentially unsafe candidate products.

Animal models will be used to complement human studies, and to select novel immunization technologies to be advanced to the clinic.\nTo address these issues in a coordinated manner, ADITEC is organised on a matrix structure in which research themes and experimental approaches feed into each other. Training curricula will be created to impact on the formation of the next generation of EU researchers in the field. ADITEC scientists and institutions are part of  the \u201cSclavo Vaccines Association\u201d (SVA), which is dedicated to vaccines and vaccine research.

The analysis is based on two key features of cognitive radio: the ability of the secondary users to discover the opportunity to use the spectrum, and assessing the electromagnetic impact of secondary user transmissions on primary system (receivers). Novel approaches are taken as we go beyond the conventional notion of detecting 'spectrum holes' into treating spectrum opportunity discovery as a data fusion problem, as well as new schemes that cope interference from multiple uncoordinated secondary users.

HVDC technology is envisaged but the deployment of meshed HVDC offshore grids is currently hindered by the high cost of converter technology, lack of experience with protection systems and fault clearance components and immature international regulations and financial instruments. PROMOTioN will overcome these barriers by development and demonstration of three key technologies, a regulatory and financial framework and an offshore grid deployment plan for 2020 and beyond. A first key technology is presented by Diode Rectifier offshore converter. This concept is ground breaking as it challenges the need for complex, bulky and expensive converters, reducing significantly investment and maintenance cost and increasing availability.  A fully rated compact diode rectifier converter will be connected to an existing wind farm.

The past 10 years Aventus has positioned and structured international traineeships solidly. First Aventus introduced an Aventus-wide organisation of Leonardo da Vinci mobility projects. After this Aventus\u2019 European network was strengthened, then Aventus respectively focused on linking the school\u2019s policy for specific needs\u2019 groups with its policy as to  international traineeships, assessing growth with intercultural competences, sustainable European partnerships and Aventus-wide implementation of innovations. The last two years Aventus started introducing ECVETcomponents. Because the translation of work processes to \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment from practice tutors from foreign training companies. After this stage Aventus together with a number of its European partners aimed at preparation of the  implementation of ECVET in order to come to a matching assessment system. Aventus achieved this for the following 5 courses: Business and Economics (European Management Assistant), Trade (International Import and Export Assistant plus European Fashion Production Coordinator and European Fashion Designer),  Automotive Technique (EUROTRANSLOG for Transport and Logistics). Aventus focused on \u201clearning agreements\u201d and \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d with this exploration of ECVET. For this purpose Aventus also became a member of ECVET-proof networks:  the NETINVET networks for International Trade and Transport & Logistics, the EURO-AST network for secretarial professions and the EUrFASHION network for fashion. Together with its European partners Aventus is now creating the \"EEE\" network for green automotive technology with its own job profile for the automotive line of business. With \u201cEUROPRO\u201d Aventus aims at making the next step. All these networks work with European reference profiles. The next few years European Profiles as reference qualifications will be the focus for international traineeships for the courses mentioned above and also for Aventus\u2019 ICT and health care courses. With the help of transparent assessment and validation these European (Job) Profiles make sure that especially the growth in professional competences during international traineeships is safeguarded  and is realized with sufficient quality. The \u201coil slick\u201d of ECVET proof international traineeships within Aventus\u2019 European partnership is getting bigger and bigger in this way.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMemorandum of Understanding\u201d expresses that Aventus has reached agreement with its partners on the content of the cooperation with student mobility and in the \u201clearning agreements\u201d of the participating students with these partners the learning aims of these students are stated. With these instruments recognition and validation of European traineeships  are safeguarded within \"EUROPRO\".  This not only happens with partners from the above-mentioned European networks but also in bilateral cooperation with Aventus\u2019 other European partners within EUROPRO and also for different courses. With these last cooperation forms the challenges are certainly bigger, because no ready-made European Profile has been drawn up yet. With these bilateral partnerships Aventus\u2019 teachers draw up the \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d together with their European partners and these can be used during \u201cEUROPRO\u201d traineeships and with international traineeships of reciprocal projects. With its Leonardo da Vinci VETPRO project \u201cEUREQUA\u201d Aventus started to enthuse its teachers and make them prepared for the use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d. Within Aventus this route will be strengthened and extended with the help of internal workshops and seminars the next few years. As to validation, while making use of \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d Aventus will mainly focus on assessment of professional competences besides intercultural competences and foreign language skills during the project period of \u201cEUROPRO\u201d. Planning exams in the work place during international traineeships will be the next step and to realize this, Aventus will organize meetings with the Dutch Inspection of Education to come to an acceptable, valid, reliable exam procedure abroad. In short this is a major quality boost with regard to validation and recognition of the outcomes of international traineeships for students who distinguish themselves with this.  The student mobility will be organized in the regions of the EUROPRO partners on the basis of intensive cooperation with Aventus in the fields of preparation, matching, execution, assessment, evaluation and dissemination of international traineeships with ECVET components from 1 July 2014 till 30 June 2016.", "http://www.rambert.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NL01-KA102-000030_21"], [2017, "European Connections", "Ballet Rambert Ltd", 118804.0, 16, 39, "The last 16 years Aventus invested much into sustainable relations with European partners.

Moreover during the last 3 years getting acquainted with ECVET instruments was high on Aventus\u2019 agenda. Because the translation of work processes into \u201cunits of learning outcomes\u201d has only been realized to a limited extent, it is still very complicated to get a reliable and valid assessment of the achievements during work placements with training companies in Europe. For this  reason together with a number of European partners, while utilizing ECVET instruments Aventus made new steps to realize both more transparency of qualifications and a matching assessment system of international work placements. This intensification of the cooperation led to the creation of formal networks, which use \u201cEuropean Job Profiles\u201d as a starting point. The international work placement and staff professionalization are organized around these job profiles within these networks. In the meantime Aventus has become a member of the following \u201cEuropean Job Profile\u201d networks: NETINVET (International Trade and Transport & Logistics), EUrFASHION (Fashion), EURO-AST (Management Assistant), EEE (green car technology), Shaping IT (IT and Media shaping), AEHT (Hotel and Tourism).

The nursing school trains 200 students, the school for OTA/ATA 150. The MHH has in addition another 257 apprenticeships in varied health care professions. We have achieved till 2014 to send over 100 students, in their second year of training, over what was formerly called the Leonardo da Vinci project abroad in Europe. Since June of 2014 we have successfully applied for the funding in the new Erasmus+ program and are in self-governing the funding. The Erasmus appointee (Bledsoe/Stanze) of the nursing school could accordingly over the years acquire a multitude of very good contacts to hospital facilities in Ireland, Austria, France, United Kingdom, Spain and Malta, where regularly, that is to say, yearly our students went to their foreign internships or as the case may be their foreign practical. The number of students that the nursing school of the BAP could allocate to participate in the Program has continually increased. With the Erasmus+ project application 2015/2017 a goal has been set, to make it possible for at least 100 Trainees of the nursing school and German wide over the pool project, to participate in the exchange program in a European land of their choice. This goal will be achieved, because of January this year already 64 grants have been issued. The internships or practical\u2019s intended duration is 4 - 7 weeks but dependent upon the application and assignment plans, the framework of the practical training and availability of the receiving organization.\r\nThe emphasis by the chosen exchange facilities lies in acute nursing care clinics, in order to further already developed practical skills during the exchange. Our experience over the past ten years and the establish network with health care Clinics throughout Europe, as well as the tremendous response from vocational Training Institutions and Trainees , show the interest and need for this program. Before the internship or practical begins the Students are counseled and advised regarding the training abroad by the Erasmus appointee of the BAP nursing school. The Erasmus appointee will be available as a contact person throughout the internship if needed. During the foreign assignment the personal Mentor stands close meshed to the side of the Trainee, the extent of which is previously agreed between the receiving organization and the Erasmus appointee of the BAP who organizes the placement. Common educational objectives, goals and outcomes are evaluated. They are establishing between the sending and host organization, the documentation is according to ECEVT.  In 2016 the BAP will for the fours time provide nursing students from Innsbruck internships in the clinical setting through the Erasmus+ Mobility program, as well as expeting 12 Nursingstudents from Turkey. Furthermore, the BAP of the MHH would like to extend this offer to addition foreign facilities and encourage them to do so, there concrete plans with Salzburg/Austria and Poland. For the first time this year we have specific request from Portugal and Spain. The foreign nursing students that take part in the Erasmus+ program at the MHH will be accompanied by a personal Mentor who has successfully completed an additional qualification\u2019s course regarding Mentoring. Additionally the Erasmus appointee makes regular visits on the stations to insure the learning progress. The most important change with this project is the changeover from the Training agreement based on ECEVT to the learning agreement developed by the ECEVT Learning group. The learning outcome units according to the DQR and EQR standards will be part in the described development of the new curriculum. Goal is the comparable qualification and education within Europe. We are certain that all health care profession will be able to profit through international exchange students. At the same time our European neighbors will recognize, that even though health care professionals in Germany have a mostly vocational training, they are none-the-less highly qualified. The students at the MHH learn skills, methods, social-communication and personal expertise and through their foreign exchange they will enhance and extend their knowledge of their profession which can be transferred effectively and goal-oriented to all aspects of their daily work practice in the varied fields of their occupation in health care and augment the theoretical instruction of the their school. This is to be supported by the exchange of the educational personnel. The BAP at the MHH strives for a professional, cultural and linguistically exchange on the local, regional, national and international level.
