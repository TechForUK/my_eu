It addresses the course of action to take when an alert to a possible PBIED has been issued, and an attack may be imminent. SuBCoP is insensitive to how the alert is raised, should it be based on detection of explosives or explosive devices, informants\u2019 reporting, or other intelligence sources. It is however sensitive to the fact that the alert only gives cause for suspecting the presence of a PBIED, and that this suspicion can be of lower or higher confidence. SUBCOP will develop guidance as to what response to a PBIED that is ethically and socially justifiable for a given situation. The core objective of SUBCOP is to consider\n\n\u2022\tthe available technological tools for less than lethal PBIED intervention,\n\u2022\tthe novel procedures for their application, and\n\u2022\tthe development of new less than lethal capabilities\n\nThese together will fit to the highly set requirements; to avoid injuries on the suspect yet control the situation to such an extent that no harm will come to innocent bystanders or first responders, should the suspicion of a PBIED presence be accurate. The SUBCOP consortium is well equipped to address this complex and challenging task, encompassing small scale and large scale security focused and technology developing enterprises, security and defence research organisations, medical and ethical expert organisations and end users with first hand experience in PBIED situations.", 488365.0, 3609515.0, "SUBCOP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cerberusblack.com", null, "fp7_108806_960084467"], ["0AD", "Innovative Solutions in the Process Industry for next generation Resource Efficient Water management", "Imcg Ltd", "INSPIREWATER demonstrates a holistic approach for water management in the process industry using innovative technology solutions from European companies to increase water and resource efficiency in the process industry.

A flexible system for water management in industries that can be integrated to existing systems is worked out and demonstrated to facilitate implementation of technical innovations.  Technical innovations in the area of selected membrane technologies, strong field magnetic particle separator, and a catalyst to prevent biofouling are demonstrated, including valorisation of waste heat. This will increase process water efficiency as well as resource, water and energy savings in the process industry.\nThe development and demonstration work is combined with a strong emphasis on exploitation and dissemination.

These trusted networks, built horizontally and vertically, will fully integrate shippers, LSPs and intermodal operators as equal partners. To reach a high level of sustainability, we will not only bundle freight volumes, but shift them off the road to intermodal rail and waterway. NEXTRUST will build these trusted networks ideally bottom up, with like-minded partners, adding multiple layers of transport flows that have been de-coupled and then re-connected more effectively along the supply chain. We will develop C-ITS cloud based smart visibility software to support the re-engineering of the networks, improving real-time utilization of transport assets. NEXTRUST will focus on research activities that create stickiness for collaboration in the market, validated through pilot cases in live conditions. The action engages major shippers as partners (Beiersdorf, Borealis, Colruyt, Delhaize, KC, Mondelez, Panasonic, Philips, Unilever) owning freight volumes well over 1.000.000 annual truck movements across Europe, plus SME shippers and LSPs with a track record in ICT innovation. The pilot cases cover the entire scope of the call and cover a broad cross section of entire supply chain (from raw material to end-consumers) for multiple industries. The creation and validation of trusted collaborative networks will be market oriented and implemented at an accelerated rate for high impact. We expect our pilot cases to reduce deliveries by 20%-40% and with modal shift to reduce GHG emissions by 40%-70%. Load factors will increase by 50%-60% given our emphasis on back-load/modal shift initiatives.
