The project is headed by Susanne Braune, who is not only a member of our school administration, but also the person in charge of quality management issues.\r\nBeing really motivated fifteen colleagues additionally volunteered for taking part in the project. \r\nThey are mainly language or vocational (technology/business/social sciences) teachers. The latter are also involved in the organisation and supervision of our local work placements.  The extended project team furthermore consists the principal, the young teachers' seminar facilitator and the head of our work placements team.\r\nDue to all this there is an enhanced focus on the vocational character of our project.\r\nThe team meets regularly in order to agree on short-term aims and imminent tasks. For each partner school there is a core team of at least one language and one vocational teacher. They gather information on the peculiarities and features that need to be taken into account and that could be of special interest for the visit.\r\nThe project serves the purpose of raising the teachers and thereby the students' awareness for our European neighbours' working and cultural environment.\r\nApart from sharing our findings and experiences with the our colleagues and students, we will glean the results of our project in an exhibition, for which we are going to invite our educational partners (a local middle school and a senior technical college) as well as the companies that provide the local work placements for our students.", "http://www.weston.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA101-000628_6"], ["2AL", "MARMOLEJO EN EUROPA", "Weston College", 8646.0, "The development of new technologies, environmental education and the teaching and learning of foreign languages is a growing need in today's society and therefore in our educational center.
