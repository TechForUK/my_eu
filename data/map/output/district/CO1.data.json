The idea of the project and of the strategic partnership made up of the University of Parma, three European Schools and a state school in England, addresses the need to create standardized tools for bilingual individuals with the aim of identifying suspected cases of Specific Learning Disorders and to activate shared procedures of intervention to ensure all students achieve educational success.\r\nIn plurilingual school contexts, language disorders can be mistaken simply for difficulty in learning the language. Viceversa, it can also be that these small disorders can hinder language learning, impeding the learning process.\r\nAll the partners will be involved in research activities, formulation and educational measures for an inclusive, innovative and social school environment.\r\nThe S.T.A.R. project is innovative because it refers to a context based on an institutionalised form of bilingual education. Its intention is to create a self sustaining protocol applying an approach based on results and on a concerted, participatory and inclusive technique.\r\nIn a multicultural society, characterised by massive migration flows, the phenomenon of multilingualism is an ever more widespread condition which sees mainly school aged or pre-school children involved. The presence of multiple cultures, and hence more languages, is a consolidated reality in European Schools and, above all, a resource.\r\nThe impact will be of real social benefit which will reach an audience of recipients at all levels.
