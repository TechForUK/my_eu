Following an Ofsted inspection in May 2013 where the school was graded \u2018good with outstanding features\u2019, there is now a strong whole school push towards becoming outstanding. A key goal, necessary to achieve this, is to deliver outstanding lessons, particularly at KS3. In order to improve the MFL curriculum and offer more choice to students joining the school, we will be teaching Spanish to half of year 7, as well as to top sets in year 8 and 9 from September 2014. We will also offer Spanish GCSE for the first time. In order to prepare for this, it is essential that I have a sufficient level of language competence and the necessary skills to confidently plan and deliver high-quality resources.\r\n\r\n I am currently studying Spanish in evening classes and devoting between four and five hours per week to independent study, to ensure my level of Spanish is sufficient. In order to build on this and accelerate my progress before September 2014, I am applying to attend a two week intensive Spanish course in Spain. This course is specifically aimed at teachers and combines language teaching with pedagogy. During this two week period I will also be staying with a native-speaking host family, which will allow me to put my learning into practice as well as accelerate my progress further through absolute immersion in the language. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is threefold: to improve my language skills (including knowledge of grammar and stuctures, vocabulary and pronunciation); to improve my confidence in planning and delivering high-quality Spanish teaching from September 2014 through pedagogical input; to return to school with ideas, resources and confidence to share with colleagues within the school and the borough of Hounslow. As I will be teaching Spanish GCSE from September 2014 it is of the utmost importance that I make significant progress, which will be validated through the award of a certificate at the end of the course. I will then use this certificate to create a Europass language passport, which will not only document my language skills but will also be beneficial in terms of improved employability as a languages teacher in the UK. \r\n\r\nI imagine the primary impact will be on my ability to plan and deliver high quality resources and lessons in Spanish from September 2014. I will consequently share all resources and as much learning as possible with colleagues within my department. I will set up a Spanish lunch, as this year I have found running a successful French lunch to not only build teachers\u2019 confidence in speaking French, but has also raised the profile of language learning and the value of languages around the school. I believe this culture of being a lover of languages and a lifelong learner enables teachers to become stronger role models for pupils, and thus the benefit of activities such as a language lunch benefits students and teachers in a wider sense as well as ensuring language competencies are maintained. I also envisage sharing learning and resources from my course with the borough MFL hub, in which language teachers meet every term to share ideas, resources and discuss curriculum developments. On a personal level, I see my current commitment to Spanish leanring, which will be greatly enhanced a course in Spain, as an investment in my future as a language teacher in the UK.", null, "Isleworth and Syon School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002219_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TW7"}
