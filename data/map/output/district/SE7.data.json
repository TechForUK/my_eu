This has been ongoing over the past 10-15 years, at a time of major European innovations in player development and coaching delivery. This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project will allow a group of 20 Charlton Athletic FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence in Austria. The Austrian host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Austrian and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives :\r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within another European country.\r\n5. Increased maturity and sense of initiative.\r\n6. Increased self-empowerment and self-esteem.\r\n7. Enhanced intercultural awareness.\r\n8. More active participation in work and social environments.\r\n9. Enhancement of soft skills.\r\n10. Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur host partner, Obertraun, was chosen on the basis of them being an acknowledged European Centre of Excellence and can demonstrate clear evidence of a mobility support structure for prospective participants. The duration of the mobility has been set at two weeks following discussions with coaching staff at the Charlton Athletic FC Academy and our Austrian partner. \r\n\r\nMobility participants will be apprentices employed by Charlton Athletic FC under the Apprenticeship in Sporting  Excellence (ASE) framework which is a work based learning programme combining training and playing  experiences with study for academic qualifications. \r\n\r\nCharlton Athletic FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate evaluation of success will be an increase in employability of participants achieving success as a professional footballer or gaining employment in a secondary career pathway. These are medium/long term surveys, which will be undertaken by Charlton Athletic FC following completion of mobility. The data collected will be disseminated freely.\r\n\r\nAside from our own internal evaluation processes, Charlton Athletic FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK professional football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework.\r\n\r\nKey project objectives involve the enhanced acquisition of key coaching innovations which will result in improved player performance and enhanced skills levels for the participant during mobility.", "http://www.cafc.co.uk", "Charlton Athletic Football Company Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012833_coordinator"], ["8BL", "Enhancing Club Success with European Mobility - A 'One Team' Approach", "Charlton Athletic Football Company Limited", 57327.0, "A key factor contributing to the development of the skills gap between English and European players has been a relative lack of interaction between our apprentice players and those at European clubs.

This ignorance of advanced European methodology has hindered skills acquisition among our young apprentice players, relative to European player development on an age-matched basis.\r\n\r\nThis project has a two-fold approach. Firstly, it will allow a group of 20 Charlton Athletic FC apprentices (aged from 16 to 19 years of age) to gain experience of the training methods at top performing Spanish football clubs. Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers.  Secondly, we seek to improve our core staff training across a range of disciplines including coaching, sports science, physiotherapy and administration by introducing them to the forward thinking ways of a variety of top performing football clubs. 30 staff will be split into 6 groups of 5 participants who will be hosted by football clubs in countries including Spain, Portugal, Belgium and The Netherlands to ensure a broad perspective is seen and the best practices can be adopted. This in turn will enhance our club performance through forward thinking techniques and practices being developed, and will also serve to enhance our \u2018One Team\u2019 approach is a core foundation for the success of Charlton Athletic.\r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives:\r\n1.
