Currently, the most urgent requirements are the capability of modelling noise, NOx stringencies and greenhouse gases in relation to the Kyoto protocol as well as related agreements together with their respective effects. Careful analysis of the complex interdependencies between air transport activities and environmental or economic effects is needed for the assessment of policies and guidance on a political level.\nThus, integrated modelling capabilities have to be enhanced. In the US, this modelling capability is currently being developed in a multi-million dollar project based upon criteria, assumptions and points of view primarily set by the US. TEAM_Play will create a modelling framework to combine and advance European modelling capabilities in order to support the European perspective in the international policy arena.\nTEAM_Play deals with interdependencies and trade-offs between noise, gas emissions, environmental and economic impacts of the air transport sector. The objective of TEAM_Play is to enhance the European modelling capabilities required for policy assessment. These capabilities will be strengthened by creating a common infrastructure allowing for the connection of existing European models (noise, gas emissions, economic and environmental impacts).\nThis is addressed in WP1 by linking the models to a data warehouse in which all required modelling input and output data are stored.WP2 covers the development of model interfaces which will enable the models to be connected. In addition, an economic impact assessment will be conducted. In WP3, assessment studies using the TEAM_Play Tool Suit will be carried out. In WP4, the dissemination will be carried out and a concept for the durable implementation beyond FP7 funding will be developed.", 37011.0, 4438608.0, "TEAM_PLAY", "Modelling tools analyse aviation policy", "A sustainable aviation policy is required to meet the demands of a globalised economy and a growing air transport sector. Of particular concern is the economic and environmental impact of such measures.", "Current models used by the International Civil Aviation Organisation - Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (ICAO-CAEP) are limited in scope. A flexible holistic integrated modelling framework that can adequately predict interdependencies and assess impact of policy measures on noise, emissions and cost is urgently needed. Such a framework could be applied at ICAO-CAEP and European, national and local levels.\n\nThe EU-funded project 'Tool suite for environmental and economic aviation modelling for policy analysis' (http://www.teamplay-project.eu (TEAM_PLAY)) was initiated to address this gap. Researchers successfully harmonised data to enhance modelling capabilities using common interfaces, data formatting guidelines and a central database. As a result, relevant data on aviation and environment can now be used for comparisons and scenario assessments to enable informed short-, medium- and long-term policymaking. A key accomplishment is the interconnectivity achieved between existing stand-alone models and the facility to incorporate other relevant models on a needs basis.\n\nFor the first time ever, a state-of-the-art tool suite has been created in Europe. This modelling framework can adequately and consistently measure the current and future impacts of aviation policies on the economy, air transport system and environment. Moreover, user-defined scenarios can assess the requirements or success level of ongoing or future European research projects in the aeronautics sector.\n\nSuccessful outcomes have led to the planning of a European modelling strategy for the durable implementation of the TEAM_PLAY tool suite. The ANCAT Modelling Interdependencies Task Group (MITG) will work on developing a joint and permanent facility for customisable and up-to-date European aviation environmental modelling. Success would ensure that European competitiveness and influence in the ICAO-CAEP or international aviation policy arena will be considerably enhanced.", null, null, "/docs/results/images/2014/20140813111802.jpg", "fp7_97151_968230430"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0AU", "\"T\u00fal az \u00d3perenci\u00e1n\"", "Cygnets Day Nurseries (Bournemouth) Ltd", 12603.0, "Our town, Perk\u00e1ta, is located in the heart of Hungary. We have a nursery school with 2 buildings and 5 classes. The name of our town probably sounds strange to the foreign ear but we can proudly say that we are very acknowledged on professional levels. One of the big results of our hard work was receiving the title \"Kincses Kult\u00far\u00f3voda\" (\u201cTreasure Culture Kindergarten\u201d) in 2016.Even though we are a nursery school from a rural area, with not too many opportunities, we have registered fourth in our county for \"Tehets\u00e9gpont\" (\u201cTalent Point\u201d) and since then we have been awarded the \"Akkredid\u00e1lt Kiv\u00e1l\u00f3 Tehets\u00e9gpont\" (\u201cAccredited Excellent Talent Point\u201d) in 2014. The training of the talented children's personality is extremely important for our institution and us. This is concentrating on three main areas at the moment.Our IT talent development has its own charm; we have researched, collected and created the program ourselves. We are very proud of our accomplishment in protecting the environment. We can gladly say, we handed in numerous successful projects regarding sustainability and won a few titles for ourselves as well such as the \"Zold \u00d3voda\" (\u201cGreen Nursery\u201d), which we gained for the third time in 2014.We have more than 30 successful projects already and are constantly looking for opportunities.Our nursery\u2019s most important aim is to educate children to be balanced, happy and able to adapt in different changes so they could become a valuable member of society.The purpose of our project \u201cT\u00fal az \u00d3perenci\u00e1n\u201d through the international relationships is to make our competency stronger, exchange professional experiences and improving our language skills.There are seven nursery teachers taking part in this project. They are open, innovative and have similar spiritualties. They have a very positive and inspiring influence on each other. They think it is very essential to have great respect for others and accept different opinions. Additionally, they are professionally prepared and in continuous training. All seven of them have a different interest, which they worked out and built into their specialities to educate children in those areas.The project is made of three job shadowing placements and a language course in three different countries. The job shadowing will take place at three nursery/primary schools in Romania, Lithuania and England involving children between the age of 3 and 7. We will build international relationships with people, institution and non-governmental organizations. We will also get to know other nationalities\u2019 culture, everyday life and educational system.While we are carrying out these activities, our competency will develop and our methodology knowledge will grow due of the new acquired information abroad.One of our teachers will be able to develop her English language knowledge through the course in England and she will become more confident and self-sufficient.This project offers an opportunity to share our knowledge and experiences with our partners. It is very important to be open-minded these days and to observe and learn.We also find it essential to pass our experiences and disseminate our new knowledge to our environment within the nursery or even broader public. We run a blog for our nursery and we share everything we can with the public, pleasing parents, colleagues and visitors.Last year\u2019s Erasmus Plus project brought a lot of positive benefits to us. We currently have 4 partners with our Erasmus Plus project: Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Cs\u00edkszentdomonkos, Bournemouth  and Jurancon\u2019s nurseries. This inspires us to continue our methods and ways in order to reach our long- term goals and to carry on with our international projects. As a result our work in the nursery turns out to be more interesting, colourful; and the nursery teachers become more and more confident using the different systems such as the web2 tools and platforms. The parents, children, colleagues and we will be more satisfied and this will improve our environment, which we work in. Our relations with each other will grow and mainly the pupils will have a better time in the nursery and also it will be a lot easier for them to adapt within the kindergarten.We would like to make sure, when we hand in our project; everyone is happy and satisfied with what we have achieved, created.We would like to thank everyone at the Tempus Public Foundation for all the information they have given us. We would like to say thank you to our international partners also for taking the time and effort to help us complete this project. We appreciate they have agreed to host us in the future without actually knowing each other. We are very excited to meet them, learn and exchange methods and our histories.
