The concept behind Safe@Sea is to increase safety by implementing improved solutions for buoyancy, tear and puncture resistance, head and hand protection, emergency warning and positioning systems. This will be achieved by the integration of state of the art materials and ICT systems and the development of new high performance materials. An ergonomic design will be developed to solve the contradictory requirements of functionality, comfort and safety.\nSpecifications will be developed (WP2) that provide input to concept development and prototyping (WP3) in close interaction with development and integration of materials (WP4) and integration of ICT solutions (WP5). The developed solutions, ergonomic design and usability will be thoroughly validated and tested (WP6). Manufacturing concepts, a standardisation strategy and roadmap for product maturing and market introduction will be developed (WP7). Demonstration of the technology developed and precommercial activities such as presentations of prototypes on exhibitions and trade fairs will take place in WP9. This will be supplemented by exploitation and dissemination activities (WP 8) and project management (WP1).\nThe consortium consists of Ohmatex ApS, FOV Fabrics AB, SISYFOS AS, Grado Zero Espace SRL, International Safety Products Limited who are leading European SMEs that develop specialised fabrics, clothing and electronics.
