However, through overuse and misuse of these agents, many micro-organisms have developed antimicrobial resistance. Oligonucleotide therapeutics have the potential to become the new class of antibacterials capable of treating a broad range of infections. By acting on novel targets, they circumvent current resistance mechanisms and with judicious use, can suppress the rise of future resistance.\n\nDNA-TRAP will build on a platform technology that uses proprietary nucleic acid-based Transcription Factor Decoys (TFDs) that act on novel genomic targets by capturing key regulatory proteins to block essential bacterial genes and defeat infection. Taking forward newly emerging insights and expertise that exists within each of the partners and through the mutual secondment of researchers, the project aims to develop a new class of nanoparticulate antibacterials capable of meeting the clinical challenge of drug-resistant infections such as Clostridium difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nDNA-TRAP will establish a lasting, international partnership for transfer of knowledge between Industry and Academia in the field of nanomedicine. Exchange of knowledge and expertise between the partners is key to establishing the fundamental properties of nanostructured drug delivery systems to treat bacterial infections and through this, provide the basis for building a manufacturing platform to advance the experimental therapeutic into clinical trials.\n\n17 researchers in the field of drug development and delivery from 2 commercial (SME) and 2 non-commercial partners across 2 member states, will have the opportunity to share and acquire new complementary and multidisciplinary knowledge, through inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary exchange, allowing for the development of new solutions and the establishment of further joint research projects.", 35380.0, 1901826.0, "DNA-TRAP", null, null, null, null, "http://www.kuecept.com", null, "fp7_110153_950837942"], ["3JF", "Reducing the Vulnerability of Space Systems", "Phs Space Limited", "It is accepted that space debris will increase in the next\ndecades despite any considerable effort made to limit their generation.\nDebris of more than 10cm can be avoided by the satellites and also the\nvery small particles of less than 0.1cm are taken into account in the\ncurrent designs.

At the same time, the capability of space industry to apply debris mitigation measures to reduce the threat is constrained by financial, technological, informational and philosophical considerations in spite of efforts to establish comprehensive debris mitigation guidelines and standards. No system currently exists to identify, quantify or address these constraints, yet while they remain it is likely that the near-Earth debris population will continue to grow and therefore the risk to assets will increase. Thus, the removal of these road-blocks is essential for the long-term, sustainable use of space. The main objective of this Support Action is to support research and development efforts being undertaken internationally and at European level, by providing a coherent and rigorous mechanism for communicating the efficacy of current debris mitigation practices and opportunities for strengthening European capability. This objective will be realised via a three-step approach: (1) surveying the capability of industry to implement debris mitigation measures and identifying existing and future challenges, (2) reviewing the capacity of mitigation measures to reduce debris creation, and (3) combining capability and capacity indicators within an environmental impact rating system to communicate the effectiveness of mitigation practices. The rating system will be directed at the public and private sectors across Europe to support their continuing efforts to implement mitigation measures.

Nearly 20\u00a0000 objects larger than 10\u00a0cm are known to orbit Earth while the number of smaller natural (meteoroid) and artificial (man-made) particles greatly exceeds this.\n\nThis number is not only concerning but also has the potential to result in catastrophic losses of space assets. At the same time, the capability of both industry and policymakers to apply debris mitigation measures is hampered by technological, financial and political constraints.\n\nWith EU financial support, the 'Alignment of capability and capacity for the objective of reducing debris' (http://www.fp7-accord.eu/ (ACCORD)) project surveyed international debris mitigation strategies. Specifically, the mitigation practices investigated were drawn from the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee's (IADC) guidelines and included passivation of spacecraft at the end of their mission and post-mission disposal.\n\nAssessment of their effectiveness in low, medium and geosynchronous orbit regions resulted in a clearer ranking of the existing measures. Moreover, the results of this comprehensive analysis were used together with those from a survey of the European space industry's capability to implement them to develop an environmental impact rating system (EIRS).\n\nThe prototype system uses indicators of the effectiveness of mitigation measures to limit the growth of space debris as well as metrics of the industry's capability to implement them. Together with other key parameters, the EIRS calculates a rating for the environmental impact of break-ups of rocket bodies, collisions of spacecraft with untracked objects and abandoned satellites.\n\nA public version of the spacecraft rating calculator is presented on a dedicated http://www.fp7-accord.eu/rating/index.html (ACCORD project web page).
