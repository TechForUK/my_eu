The main activity of the project - the youth worker's training course will take place in Slovenia from November 11 to November 16, 2015 in Bre\u017eice, Slovenia.\r\nAs associations working daily in the youth community, we noted the existence of an educational void as regards to the question of gender, development of sexuality and affectivity, mutual respect and diversity. These aspects are an important ground on which to focus, not only by the construction of the identity of the individual, but also within the formation of relationships and peer groups of a young person. Today in Europe, the need to maintain an open debate on these issues is all the more evident as one is confronted with the negative consequences of the absence of solid education on the latter topics.  Therefore, our project proposal is focusing on the daily work needs of youth workers, as well as a need for the exchange of practice and a professional debate taking into consideration the latter topics. \r\nThe primary purpose of this project is the construction of a space for dialogue between youth workers and other practitioners from different countries. As well as sharing of their knowledge on the subject of Gender and Sexuality in order to develop an overview of the status about the core topics of the proposed project in Europe. During the course participants will:\r\n- Share the problems and difficulties they are facing about the issues connected with the topic during the course of their daily work activities as youth workers;\r\n- Using elements of non-formal education develop appropriate methodologies to promote the youth culture that respects gender and sexual orientations; \r\n- Reflect and search for means and approaches on fighting stereotypes and inequalities and will provide critical tools of deconstruction of harmful media messages;\r\n- Work on the spread of safe sex and healthy embracing the broad interpretation of sexuality proposed by WHO in \"standard for sex education in Europe\" understood as an area of human potential, which includes in itself the themes of body, identity, affectivity and respect for differences;\r\n- Visit organisations and initiatives to increase awareness of the daily practice on the topics of gender identity, sexuality and gender violence of local surroundings and find more about the issues from the practitioners working daily with the youth. \r\n\r\nThe project methodology is designed in order to create a space for the practitioners within the youth work to exchange, share and reflect on the practices, challenges and obstacles they face regarding the topics of gender equality, equal opportunities; sexual orientation; sexual security, sexual health; gender stereotypes; sexualisation of the media, advertising and objectification and pornography.\r\nDuring the training, a non-formal education methodology will be utilised: groups work, multimedia usage, pop songs analysis, role-play, using cards and board games, creating visual materials, producing informative messages, expressing opinions via physical activities.\r\n\r\nThe main impact on the participants will represent the enrichment of their skills and competences on the topics covered by the training. During the project, youth workers will also enrich their social skills, develop their personality, they will emotionally and culturally grow as they will increase their autonomy and build new relationships. The impact on the participating organisations will consist of sustainable network for exchange, support and development of new ideas, as well as for future collaborations regarding the topic. Moreover, the project will be beneficial due to the increase of knowledge and skills of the organizations' key personnel with regard to the planning, management and evaluation of projects as well as the increase of their experience in working with the youth and sharing of knowledge and information.\r\nFor the target groups, we believe that the greatest impact will be made up of a direct benefit in terms of skills and abilities due to transferred lessons learned to daily practices of the youth workers participating in this training.

In the past the project has run from its own premises but due to funding cuts is now run by voluntary staff in a variety of settings. They run one social group every week and support young people on a one-to -one basis when they are refereed from an educational establishment or other youth agency.

This is done by offering individual support and guidance, developing peer led activities and working closely with schools and other agencies to effect increased awareness and support to young people at a critical time in their learning. Our activities are heavily based on informal educational principles and we use experiential learning methods, otherwise refereed to as learning by doing.

The partner projects will be WOW Project from Slovakia and Cazalla from Southern Spain.\r\nThe Inspired by North of the Sun project came about as the young people wanted to create more structure to the group and have the opportunity to increase their employability or access to education by achieving some validation of their work and the inspiration came last year when we went to the BANFF film festival. They  wanted to achieve this in three main ways by gaining certification, by creating an individual project about nature and by learning new skills.\r\n The members wanted to have an opportunity to do something that they had previous never had access to  and that was to travel and visit new places this they felt would help in them making new friends and experiencing new cultures and lifestyles. After researching on the web we came across the Erasmus + programme and read that this could give us the chance to travel to mainland Europe as part of a bigger project. The young people started to talk about ideas and what theme they wanted the project to have and they finally decided that they felt the Environment and Sustainability was a subject they knew little about and wanted to understand further about in relation to themselves and others.\r\nThe project will be split into three main areas a self development section where the young people will be prepared and focus on gaining the required skills necessary to take part e.g linguistic skills, and basic horse riding. They will also decide on an individual project, group project, and create an individual learning plan with their objectives and aims for the project time and into the future.

Part of this learning will be achieved by the young people being involved from the very beginning of the project through to the final evaluation stage.\r\nWe envisage that the project results will include the young people having raised their self esteem, self confidence, they will learn new skills, develop a portfolio of work, had their work validated through the Youth Pass scheme, made new friends from different cultures and backgrounds, been challenged as an individual and as a member of a group, visited new places, done things they never thought they would have the opportunity to and importantly increased their future employability.

Staff across the school will have a more secure familiarity when repeating familiar phrases, sining songs/rhymes.  We already have some extended classes where children learn new languages, this would be enhanced through the competencies of Spanish.  \r\n2. Developing the creative curriculum through integrating the learning of Spanish with other curriculum areas, such as art and geography.  As a small school where teachers have several responsibilities, this project will enable us to deliver a curriculum in a manageable and innovative way.  It will refocus the use of Spanish across the whole of the school and not just through formal teaching sessions.  Provision for children who have Spanish as a primary language will be more greatly encouraged to deliver parts of sessions in Spanish eg. in a maths counting session, recall of facts etc.    Having Spanish focused celebrations which coincide with our Christian calendar and embrace a number of Christian values shared through cultural weeks, focus days and link to festivals celebrated across the Spanish calendar.\r\n3. In a modern world we will be able to provide opportunities for links through technology, especially with our link school in Madrid.  This could be through etwinning platform, skype, emails etc.\r\n4. Developing the European Dimension - now that we have achieved an Outstanding grade from Ofsted and our core curriculum is being well delivered, we realise that we can now look out more to the world beyond and ensure that our pupils can become global citizens who know what it means to be a European citizen. We plan to do an audit of our curriculum to ensure that it reflects a global dimension as well as a British approach. We aim to use the British Council's International School Award criteria to guide as through the work.\r\nAs a small school a maximum of 6 participants would be able to carry out the project and feedback successfully to the rest of the staff, as relatively small number of 24.

The pre-production and shooting of the film will be conducted in Reykjavik whilst the post-production of the film will be done in London. The film is about a young religious woman who belongs to a small religious group in Iceland where, amongst other things, blood transfusions are strictly forbidden. After suffering serious injuries in a car accident, she is accidentally given such a transfusion and wakes up to find that her body has been contaminated. The film observes the woman as she tries to save her soul and win back the trust of her fellow parishioners and family members. A small sliver of doubt enters her mind and she starts questioning the rules by which she has chosen to live her life. We observe this young woman as she stands on a crossroad, uncertain as to whether she should commit to her faith or turn her back on everyone she knows. \r\n\r\nMembers of both our groups have religious backgrounds and as a group we have had many discussions about religion. We wanted to further explore the subject of faith and after researching small religious groups and cults, we decided to use the Jehova Witnesses' ban against blood transfusion as a basic premise for our film. We want to elevate the discussion though and focus more on what happens when someone is thrown out of their comfort circle and isn't sure whether he wants to go back inside it? The theme of blindly adhering to social pressures and norms and realizing only too late that your heart lies elsewhere is a universal sentiment and we want our film to reflect that. \r\n\r\nACTIVITIES AND METHODOLOGY \r\nThere will be four main activities.

In each department the members of both groups will have specially designed tasks that they will have to commit to and deliver before a special deadline. \r\n\r\nPRE-PRODUCTION : \r\n\r\nWriting: \r\nMembers of the group will have to brainstorm ideas and comment on script drafts until everybody involved agrees on overall story. The screenwriter, director and producer will have the final say but a clear focus is set on developing the story as a group.  \r\n\r\n\"Making-of\": The director of the \"making-of\" film will start filming as soon as the pre-production starts and capture the whole process on film. \r\n\r\nLocation Scouting and Casting: \r\nWhen the script is ready, the producer in Iceland: Anna S\u00e6unn, and director will arrange for location scouting and set up auditions for actors. \r\n\r\nCREW AND EQUIPMENT: \r\nAnna S\u00e6unn will get a crew together and rent the needed equipment. \r\n\r\nART DEPARTMENT: \r\nOnce the location and actors have been decided upon, the production designer, Sn\u00e6d\u00eds, will start renting props, furniture and costumes. She will send pictures to both groups so that everyone can capture and understand the general atmosphere and artistic feel of the film. This is something that will help all the other departments when preparing their work. \r\n\r\nSHOOTING SCHEDULE AND FRAMING  \r\nThe 1st AD, Bylgja, the DOP, \u00de\u00f3r, and the producer, Anna S\u00e6unn, will set up a shooting schedule with the director. \r\n\r\nACTOR REHEARSAL AND DRESSING \r\nEverybody in the Iceland group will assist the rehearsal and dressing for the actors. The 1st AD, producer, DOP and director will go over the details of each scene.  The production designer will set up a list of costumes needed for each scene, each day. The Sound Engineer and producer from London will fly over to assist the rehearsal and shooting of the film. \r\n\r\nDuring the pre-production the music composer will have sent over some samples of music which both groups will be able to comment on. \r\n\r\nSHOOTING OF THE FILM \r\nThe film will be shot in 6-7 days. \r\n\r\nPOST-PRODUCTION: \r\n\r\n1st DRAFT OF EDITING: \r\nThe footage will be taken to London and the producer in London, Sophie Brooks, will oversee and manage the overall procedure. She will create a time frame for a first draft of the movie to be sent to everyone so that both groups can comment and bring their ideas to the mix. The director and producer will have the final say.  \r\n\r\nMUSIC COMPOSING / SOUND ENGINEER\r\nWhen the first draft has been completed the music composer and sound engineer can start working on their craft. During the course of the production they will have prepared and so will not be working from scratch. Samples of music and sound will sent to both groups. \r\n\r\nPR\r\nA strong online presence will be created for the film. \r\n\r\nFESTIVAL SEASON \r\nBoth groups will participate in applying for festivals that particularly apply to the project and subject matter. We will attend the festivals when possible, participate in classes and lectures and try to create a lasting international network for both groups.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-2-IS02-KA205-001580_1"], ["1EA", "Young entrepreneurs - if not you then who?", "LONDON BOROUGH OF HACKNEY", 54978.0, "This project is an outcome from the recent economic situation in Europe and its high unemployment, affecting mostly young people.\r\nThe public education system doesn\u00b4t adapt fast enough to the socio-economic changes in the society and therefor it does not supply young people with tools and attitudes, so necessary to become an active member of our societies. Young people will rather look for a job than think to create one, as they are lack of self confidence, personal initiatives as practical knowledge and tools in order to develop their ideas and consider to become an entrepreneur.\r\nPartners:\r\n- Asociaci\u00f3n J\u00f3venes Solidarios, Spain\r\n- Patronus, Slovakia\r\n- London Borough of Hackney, UK\r\n- Hacetteppe Univercity, Turkey\r\n- CIM Horyzonty, Poland\r\n\r\nWith the project: \"If not you, then who?Teaching Entrepreneurship\" we want to work on the following aims:\r\n1. To fight the state of passivity and no active participation of young people in the stage when they are still students.\r\n2. To create and investigate a range of didactic tools that will help youth workers and teachers to teach young people skills and abilities necessary to consider a future entrepreneurship, with emphasis on entrepreneurship considering added value to the community.\r\n3. To increase the quality of youth sector as an important actor of fomenting and teaching youth initiative and entrepreneurship by disseminating the booklet with developed entrepreneurship sessions.\r\n4. To complement the formal education with no formal methodology.\r\n\r\nThe project will address young people in age between 13 and 30, members of non profit organizations and public educational centers.\r\nThe project will contain the following activities:\r\n- 3 Work meetings among the staff /partners involved\r\n- Design of serie of pedagogic sessions about teaching entrepreneurship\r\n- Implementation of sessions\r\n- Internal evaluations\r\n- Creation of a booklet with the teaching methodology,session plan and didactic tools based on experience and field investigation\r\n- Creation of the e-booklet in order to make the result accesible for everybody\r\n- Creation of a leaflet to make the dissemination of the intelectual result more easy\r\n- 4 multipier events (in Spain, Slovakia, Turkey and UK)\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nA document created by all participants with session plans to be taught on the following levels:\r\na) Directed to students between 13 and 17 years (Secondary Education)\r\nb)Directed to students between 16 and 30 years (VET Education and Superior Education)\r\nThrough the created booklet (and e-booklet) with the didactic tools we hope to contribute in the field of entrepreneurial education. As in the current times with a huge unemployment, we believe in the significance of teaching our youth entrepreneurial skills and in the implementation of similar projects that can be copied and multiplied over whole European Community. \r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nThe project will influence three main groups of people engaged in its implementation: \r\n1. The involved organizations, \r\n2. The young participants of the sessions ,\r\n3. The youth workers, trainers and teachers interested in the implementing of the sessions.\r\nThe staff of all our organizations will gain new knowledge and experience in the field of youth work. Thanks to the new tool that we will have developed, the organizations will be able to widen their offer of activities for young people and to increase quality of teaching entrepreneurship and initiative. \r\nThe young people, who will participate in the sessions, will learn concrete entrepreneurship skills and abilities, as well as other know-how that will increase their employability (social skills, functional skills, communication skills, etc.) We expect to broaden their horizons and help them to become more active and to discover their capacity to become an entrepreneur. \r\nAs for the youth work sector and the schools \u2018staff, they will receive help in their professional work related to youth initiatives, active citizenship and entrepreneurship.\r\nThrough the created booklet with the didactic tools we hope to contribute to the field of entrepreneurial education.

The project will bring together 3 organisations from 3 EU countries (UK, Spain and Germany) to develop an effective model of working with employers to include and support disabled and disadvantaged young people into work.\r\n\r\nThe low employment rate for disabled people is a significant problem across Europe. The EU Youth Strategy 2010-2018 identifies employment and social inclusion as major concerns for young people. The EU Disability Strategy 2010-2020 states that \u201cFor people with disabilities the rate of poverty is 70% higher than average partly due to limited access to employment\u201d. A major cause of high unemployment has been identified by participating organisations as the negative attitudes of employers to working with disabled young people.\r\n\r\nThe partners will identify the issues that DDYP and their employers face at work; research best practice solutions to address these and test these practices in each organisation with a view to improving and adjusting them to work for different target groups. Specific objectives are to:\r\n\u2022 Improve knowledge and understanding of employers\u2019 attitudes and barriers to employing DDYP.\r\n\u2022 Understand, transfer and develop knowledge of successful approaches to engaging employers in different countries.\r\n\u2022 Develop the capacity of youth workers to engage with employers in recruiting DDYP into the workplace.\r\n\r\nThe main beneficiaries will be staff members of the 3 partner organisations who engage daily with DDYP. Indirect beneficiaries will total 240, comprising two staff members at each employer engaged by the project and 150 disabled or disadvantaged young people that the organisations will involve in the project.\r\n\r\nWe will apply an iterative methodology to develop the model using the following steps:\r\n\u2022 Sharing practices on employer engagement.\r\n\u2022 Testing practices\r\n\u2022 Identifying working elements\r\n\u2022 Sharing results\r\n\u2022 Fine tuning practices accordingly\r\n\u2022 Testing new fine-tuned practices\r\n\r\nThe project will be implemented within the programmes that participating organisations currently deliver. We will collect, analyse and evaluate data focussed on the following four stages of employer engagement:\r\n\r\n1. First point of contact (what is the best way to approach an employer, what type of employer is more receptive to what type of approach, how to reach decision makers within a company).\r\n\r\n2. Persuasion (how to most effectively change perceptions and improve knowledge regarding capabilities of disabled people in the workplace across an entire company organisational structure).\r\n\r\n3. Getting the disabled person into work with due support (how can employers provide due support within the working environment in an effective way and optimising the time spent by internal resources, how youth workers can support young people effectively into employment, how youth organisations can support employers to engage with DDYP).\r\n\r\n4. Gradual withdrawal to allow the disabled person to continue working independently (how long does it take for the person to work independently, what are the steps, what means of verification are needed).\r\n\r\nThe project will achieve the following impact:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improved capability of organisations to test and implement different practices to engage employers.\r\n\u2022 Changed perceptions and knowledge of employers regarding disability in the workplace, improved use of equipment and understanding of appropriate technologies (if needed); improved capability to integrate DDYP into the workplace.\r\n\u2022 Improvements in the way employers support beneficiaries in delivering tasks, improved understanding of the benefits of employing a DDYP; employers are better equipped to hire disabled young people.\r\n\u2022 DDYP are more empowered in the workplace; have improved their interpersonal skills and are more effective in the workplace.\r\n\r\nProject findings and good practices will be adopted by each of the partner organisations by capacity building staff to implement the identified best practices. This means that the results will be maintained and become an integral part of employability projects for the target groups. Trained staff will cascade these new methodologies to their peers which will ensure that engagement and successes in securing employment for their participants is maintained.\r\n\r\nThe project results will be shared locally and nationally in UK, Spain and Germany and across Europe and the model will eventually be applicable to different organisations working with young people facing different types of disadvantages, to improve their engagement with employers.

First, there is a growing consensus that the social and economic models that have served us for decades are no longer fit for purpose. The \u2018crisis in Europe\u2019 has led to calls for radical new approaches that support \u2018socio-ecological transitions\u2019 for a new sustainable Europe, enabling the EU to cope with pressing problems of climate change, an aging population, pressures on welfare budgets, massive immigration and a growing disillusion with established democratic institutions. Second, there is widespread agreement that a sustainable future cannot be achieved without the active engagement of the individuals who will be forming the core of our future society - European youth. Thirdly, however, there is also widespread agreement that current systems, structures and models are failing young people. Fourthly, set against the trend of a growing core of marginalised and at risk youth, the social inclusion, education and training models that are currently being applied to improve the life chances of young people are also not fit for purpose. \r\nSet against this background, KEYSTONE's main aim is to develop, implement and evaluate an innovative approach to delivering interventions aimed at the socio-economic inclusion of marginalised young people, based on 'Community Lablets'. These Lablets aim to explore how at risk young people can play a pivotal role in creating socio-ecological innovations for a sustainable model for change in the EU. Project strategic objectives are: to identify the key drivers and constraints to young people's participation in interventions; to set up Community Lablets in four EU cities that enable young people  to become co-producers of social innovations; to conduct one action research experiment in each to develop and evaluate a co-produced social innovation;  to share innovation using a \u2018benchlearning\u2019 methodology; to use replication analysis to assess the replicability and sustainability of the Lablet approach at the wider EU level.\r\n\r\nThe partnership is composed of 5 partners from 5 EU member states: Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK.\r\n\r\nThe project overall methodology is based on a \u2018Theory of Change\u2019 framework. The overall methodology incorporates four inter-related components: i)  a research methodology based on \u2018lifeworld analysis\u2019; ii) a \u2018socio-technical\u2019 methodology involving developing ICT-supported \u2018Community Lablets\u2019; iii) a \u2018learning and behaviour change\u2019 methodology to support young people in self-development; iv)  an \u2018action research\u2019 methodology to apply the support programme.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned to implement the project methodology combine: Activity 1: Lifeworld Analysis;  Activity 2: Development of Technical Platform, tools and Knowledge Space;  Activity 3:  Development of KEYSTONE Community Lablets; Activity 4: Development of KEYSTONE Collaborative Support Programme;  Activity 5: Support Programme Implementation and Socio-ecological experiments;  Activity 6: Evaluation;  Activity 7: Dissemination & Replication;  Activity 8: Project Management. \r\n\r\nThe key expected short term results of KEYSTONE for participating young people are:  acquisition of digital competences across a range of ICTs; increased skills in problem solving, creativity, entrepreneurship, communication and teamwork; increased skills in ideas generation; increased critical thinking and evaluation skills; increased capacity to 'read the world' - better understanding of their realities and the communities they live in; increased capacity and skills for joint working and action planning. \r\nIn the long term the potential benefits of the project for participating young people are: re-engagement and retention in education and training; improved digital and media competences; improved transitions into education; more opportunities to apply knowledge in practical and/or novel ways; increased employability and access to labour market opportunities; improved social and personal development; increased social and civic engagement\r\nThe potential benefits for participating youth organisations are: the integration of good practices and new methods into professional activities; more coordinated and better targeted service provision, improved application of ICTs to deliver quality services. Improvements in service delivery will lead to benefits for clients.    \r\nAt the societal level, the project will make a contribution to increasing the quality of youth work in Europe and beyond, better alignment of youth systems to the needs of and opportunities offered by the labour market,  closer links to business and the community and more strategic and integrated use of ICTs and open educational resources (OER) by youth systems.

At the same time the rapid growth of digital tools available increase the challenges of nowadays. The high exposure of 21st century students in web 3.0 tools, devices, and environments opens a window of new affordances, challenges, opportunities, and skills for  learning/teaching and assessment. \r\nBased on existing models that combine the process (collection of activities) and the product ( result of the learning process), teachers have to implement innovative methods to get better results in  both technology competency as well as academic levels.\r\nWe have students that ususlly get bored at the classroom because sometimes learning is based on repetition, students  don't need to perform an activity dozens of times to acquire knowledge. Too much repetition not only doesn't help our students to develop knowledge and transversal skills they need, but also lead they regret schools activities. The  learning process should be focussed on competences and not just in contents.\r\nThe project plans  build up a Community of Practice to improve the quality of teaching in participant schools. In a world of continuous  social, cultural, economic and technological change, teachers themselves need to reflect on their own teaching practice in the context of their particular school environment and share these thoughts with other teachers. Teachers will be able to learn at  school (through teacher trainning sharing practices, action research, and new educational methods-related planning teams); From this process teachers will be able to enrich the curriculum  in Kindergarten and Primary.\r\nWe plan to build up a partnership among schools in which through the collaboration will promote among teachers professional values and attitides like  reflective practice, autonomous learning, collaboration with colleagues and parents,  engagement in research and innovation as a way to acquire new skills , and an involvement in the development of the whole school.\r\nPartners plan to  support innovative teaching and learning environments on curricula contents, at the same time learners will acquire competences, basic transversal skills, knowledge and attitudes. Teachers will  be trained to  work with new  methods and tools and to create learning practices/e-learning materials that can be used by other schools  in participant countries and other  European countries.\r\nTeachers will draw up  a model for students\u2019 learning that through the national curriculums context will develop transversal skills neded.
