This will predominantly be achieved by a member of the Modern Languages department, Yasmynn Lloyd, taking part in a 3-week Spanish immersion course taking place in M\u00e1laga, Spain and run by Languages for Education Europe, in July 2018, and the following impact that such an activity will have on the implementation of Spanish as the L3 at Bo\u2019ness Academy. Yasmynn is a recently qualified teacher of French who has in her own time undertaken a Graduate Diploma in Spanish through Distance Learning. The aforementioned LFEE course includes the opportunity for the GTCS professional recognition of residency, allowing Yasmynn to take steps towards gaining full GTCS registration in Spanish to add to the French she currently teaches. This will then allow the Modern Languages department at Bo\u2019ness Academy to offer a full range of French and Spanish courses to all young people at the school, from S1 through to certificated classes in the senior phase, in line with the Scottish Government\u2019s 1+2 Languages policy. Yasmynn, as cluster lead for 1+2 languages development across the five feeder primary schools, will be able to work closely with primary colleagues to implement Spanish as the cluster L3 from P5 onwards as of August 2018. Participation in the course will also allow professional dialogue and exchange of ideas, teaching strategies and resources between Spanish teachers from across Europe, which can then be shared across departmental and School level, as well as within the cluster of feeder primary schools, and wider across the local authority to ensure that the activity benefits the Spanish learning of as many young people as possible. Through the increase of confidence and competence gained as a result of this course, Bo\u2019ness Academy will be well equipped to form partnerships with schools abroad using the eTwinning platform and the expertise of European colleagues to provide meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences for young people across the curriculum.", "http://bonessacademy.com/", "Bo'ness Academy", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047105_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH51"}
