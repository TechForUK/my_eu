Different sections can be chosen : first education based on hospitality business including cooking, service, wine service, pastry and catering services, then education based on hairdressing and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe different classes our students can attend and diplomas they can get are the \"baccalaur\u00e9ats professionnels\" (vocational A-level) with special sections based on the knowledge of European cultures and languages named \"section europ\u00e9enne\" in English or in Spanish. We emphasise the main objective of the program on enabling our students to go abroad and have a work experience there, in as much as they mostly come from low classes. Then, that will help them find a job more easily in restaurants as the knowledge of different cultures and different languages is very important in hospitality business.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send 17 students to different countries : the United Kingdom (England and Scotland), Spain or Germany. We\u2019ve been working with some of the hotels and restaurants since 2005 and we are looking for new ones that we would like to develop a partnership with in the future. The choice of the students depends on the diploma they want to pass, the motivation shown  and the involvement of the pupil in their training. The selection of the candidates is made by all the teaching team and the heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different activities are related to the requirements of the diploma and the evaluation criteria are translated according to the objectives of the training session. The translation is made into the language of the host business of the student and is sent and explained to the tutor before the beginning of the training period.\r\n\r\nThe project will be organised as followed:\r\n- First, we make a selection of the hotels and restaurants we intend to send our students to, some of them we have been working with since 2005) and others are newcomers. The choice of the traineers depends on the personality of our students and the diploma prepared.   \r\n- Then, we organise an information meeting with all the students to explain the project to them. Another one is held with the students who are interested, their families and the heads.\r\n- The preparation of the students is made by the teacher of the vocational subject with the teacher of English or Spanish, and is coordinated by the contact person through different researches : study on culture and tourism of the different European regions (Scotland and Devon for the UK, Catalonia for Spain and Baden Wurttemberg for Germany). This cultural side is studied through researches on the Internet, tasting of local products, organisation of dinners on different themes, and the study of the touristic and cultural (museums and way of life) as well as other practical aspects of the life in the chosen country. These actions are made to ensure the participants a better integration during their training period.\r\n- The selection of the participants will be made by the teaching team and the heads.\r\n- The translation of all the documents will be made by the teacher(s) of the vocational subject with the teacher of English or Spanish (terms and conditions, evaluation criteria, objectives etc....)\r\n- A meeting is organised to explain precisely to the participants and their family all they need to know to make sure everything will be all right (insurance, transport, lodging, rules to adopt etc...)\r\n- The ticket to reach the firm is booked by the school,\r\n- The during all the training period the student keeps in touch with the teacher who will assess the work done by the traineer with the tutor. He/she will make sure the student arrived safely, contact the tutor to follow the training period, will have some contact with the students, will open a private facebook account and make sure that the student returns safely to France at the end of the training session).\r\n\r\nThis process is shared by all the teachers under the supervision of the contact person. The validation is given by our head.\r\n\r\nWe intend to go on working with the partners we've been working with since 2005 and to create some new partnerships to adapt ourselves to the requirements of the market. The hotels and restaurants that welcome our students are motivated to share their knowledge and working methods as well as their language with the participants. It also contributes to give a good representation of their business.\r\n\r\nOur students are satisfied with the project as it allows them to develop their professional and linguistic skills. It also allows them to discover new cultures and develop their sense of belonging to the European Union.

Therefore, in the context of planned actions, we see a great need to improve language skills of our teachers. School Development plan planned activities which will have impact on various functional areas of the school. Within each of these areas the school sets various goals and tasks which arise from the need to meet many diverse needs of both the school as a whole and to its individual components: teachers, executives, students.\r\n1. Improving methods of teaching science subjects and foreign languages, expanding the range of various teaching aids to increase students' motivation, expanding the use of digital technologies in teaching, increasing the importance of the method of projects in science education.\r\n2. Improving language skills of foreign language teachers and increasing language competence of other educational staff and management, thereby increasing students' motivation to learn foreign languages.\r\n3. Modification of teaching programmes to correlate with extramural classes in order to use CLIL.\r\n4. Improving the model of teaching and learning through the observation of learning and teaching patterns in other countries and using the best experiences in practice.\r\n5.

The philosophy of the company has always been to excel and provide an excellent, first class service to our customers. Our service rests on the capability, skill and dedication of our staff members who on a daily basis provide a hospitality service which is highly appreciated by hundreds of guests who visit the hotel each year.  Like any other prestigious hotel, culinary excellence is one of the things we constantly strive for and it is for this reason that we believe strongly in the need to continuously invest in our human resources. Patisserie is one area  in our culinary offering which is constantly evolving and thus it is essential that our staff is provided with the right opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge in this area by partnering up with one of the leading culinary schools in the UK. It is to be pointed out that there are no training facilities in Malta offering specific culinary training in the field of patisserie including the Institute of Tourism thus this mobility experience meets the needs of the participant to excel in this area and the need of the employer to have highly skilled individuals in this area. \r\n\r\nAs clearly pointed out in the European Commission's Communication ' Investing in Europe's Youth' we strongly believe that 'Learning, studying and training in another country provides a unique experience and opens up new horizons' and how 'Vocational education and training learning mobility brings benefits to both the participant and the employer'. In view of this, the objectives of the project shall be: \r\n1) To provide an opportunity to  one of our youngest team members to enhance his skills and knowledge in pastisserie \r\n2) To use the skills obtained by our employee to share knowledge and lessons learnt with other staff members \r\n3) To improve the quality of the service we offer through the effort and enhanced knowledge of our skilled and capable employees\r\n4) To enable one of our employees to acquire a certification in patisserie from one of the leading culinary academies in the world\r\n\r\nThis project will consist of long term mobility experience for one of our employees to carry out a  blended training and on the job experience at one of the leading culinary academies in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe participant will be carrying out a long term mobility that will have a significant impact on his career, his knowledge, skills and competences in the area of pastry.
