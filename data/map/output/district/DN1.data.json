They also get the opportunity to develop mainly in the English language.\r\n\r\nWe strive to reach harmony in our goals for a sustainable development of our school and society in accordance with other learning institutions in Europe not only on the social level in reference to the multicultural school environment. Furthermore from an environmental perspective we should constantly take a stand to issues of climatic nature and take precautionary measure as to preserving our resources. Equality, social integration, human rights and a sustainable development will lead to a more widened EU-perspective. \r\n\r\nTo achieve a deeper knowledge regarding similarities and differences in educational issues, overall subjects and be given the opportunity of exchanging experience and ideas as well as to develop links with teachers from other European countries. Students can through workplacement training abroad establish contacts with entrepreneurs in Europe that they can use when looking for work. In previous projects, students from ALG have been offering employment after their time at companies abroad. Internationalization should permeate the intercultural education of our school through teachers sharing newly gained competence and learning skills with colleagues. This will benefit our school in a longer term perspective resulting in an enrichment through a greater understanding of different cultures. Our students will achieve better results and gain new skills that will help them in a future profession and more students will probably take the opportunity to have workplacement training in another country and in the future also seek employment in Europe.", "http://www.don.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA102-012137_6"], ["1JL", "Keep Calm and Keep on Hairdressing", "Oracle Training Consultants ltd", 55836.0, "In times of the economic crisis and the high rates of youth unemployment facilitating longterm employment of young apprentices becomes extremely valuable. The main purpose of this project is to provide VET learners with skills that match the needs of the labour market \u2013 national and transnational - and thereby to increase their chances for a smooth transition into stabile employment and self-employment.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project is to increase the knowledge and self confidence of VET apprenticesin European technical structure and techniques and improve these skills which will make them multi skilled in the hair and beauty industry.The activities aim at increasing the employability, self-employability and horizontal and vertical mobility of participants in the local, national and EU labour market promoting marketability of their curricula with previous work experience in the European context, internationally recognized certifications, good foreign language preparation (especially work-specific); and to stimulate a desire to update and refresh their skills and learning also after the school training and the traineeship. \r\n\r\nThe project, of a 24 months duration, has the specific objective to develop and certify practical skills on state-of-the-art equipment in companies that work with cutting-edge technologies, and soft skills (such as dealing with customers) in a real-world environment to 60 students (4 groups of 15). The groups of participants aged 17 years or older, enrolled in the 2nd year of the Hairstyle and Beauty course, will take part in a mobility activity in Bergamo, Italy. \r\n\r\nThis objective will be achieved through traineeships in Italy in modern beauty and hair salons. Mobility will last 2 weeks and will be preceded by a preparatory phase (pre-departure and on-arrival) to introduce the experience from the cultural and practical point of view, contextualizing them within the professional training which they will be attending. The mobility will include 2-week work-based training, that will include a 1-day on-arrival preparation and a 1-day final evaluation, organized by the HO. It is decided that the mobility lasts 2 weeks in order for the learners to have enough time to be introduced to their new surroundings, become acquainted with the working environment, absorb a basic specific language terminology and to have enough time for a quality training process.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the host country is linked to the fact that Italy represents one of the reference points in Europe for the professional standards of the hairdressing sector and trends.\r\n\r\nThe project is promoted by Oracle in collaboration with the HO IKAROS. The HO has a consolidated experience in training VET learners, and taking part in transnational and international mobility programmes for VET learners. The HO has collaborated in VET learner mobility programmes with Oracle. The project was a natural continuation and a reinforcement of an ongoing cooperation between the applicant and the host organization.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of VET learners in the partner countries will improve social cohesion and international cooperation. The cooperation between the VET training institutions will, on one side, contribute to the internationalization of their courses, comparison and division of best practices, creation of new cooperation projects in the future and the possibility of involving new international partners in future projects. This will inevitably promote intercultural learning of all parties included. The visibility of the project, ensured by the dissemination activities of the partners involved, will make visible the quality of VET training and employment and professional opportunities, making vocational training a more modern and attractive learning option. Finally, the resulting increase in the number of qualified workforce in the respective sectors will bring upon a reduction of the unemployment rate, increase in longterm employment and consequentially contribute to the economic growth on the European level. The new workforce will not only be more qualified for the respective area of work, but also be more adaptable to international and intercultural working environments.

It was founded in 1983, with the purpose of contributing to the social improvement and integral development of students. The activity of the Foundation focuses primarily on Orcasitas neighbourhood, one of the poorest in Madrid. The social environment of the average student offers few possibilities. This is why the basic educational activities of the Foundation are called Pedagogy of Integration, a strong commitment with young people in an attempt to rebalance the inequalities of their origins. It is in this context that an initiative like Erasmus + is so important, allowing students who otherwise would not be able to gain an international mobility experience.\r\nA total of 24 students participate in this project: 4 in the area of FP Basic Electricity and Electronics, 4 FP Basic Computing and Communications, 4 FP Basic Administration and Management, 4 FP Basic Cooking and Restoration, 4 FP Intermediate Microcomputer Systems and Networks and 4 FP Intermediate Administrative Management. Furthermore, four persons will accompany the under age students.\r\nThe activities last throughout the whole project, 24 months. Special emphasis lies on the contact with the partners and the companies abroad. Students will be trained and prepared for international dealings, strengthening their languages skills. The last stage of this project consists in concluding interviews where students prove the gain development and maturity.\r\nThe methodology used to develop the project consists of three stages: First, finding a partner who is willing to hosts students and offers training in English. Second, maintaining a constant communication with the companies. Finally, continuous monitoring of students in the mobility period as well as evaluating and reflecting effects and results.\r\nThe results will benefit the development of basic skills, focusing primarily on intercultural competence, communicative competence and social-personal competence; besides developing skills that are characteristic to its area. These results will be presented in the training\u00b4s final report, the Europass-Mobility, which in long-term will improve the prospects of finding employment. The expected effect of this project is not limited to participating students, but extends to the Foundation itself, gaining international experience, improvement in the process and innovation of the organization. Moreover, partners that welcome students from different countries will profit from supporting young talents. In addition, a positive influence on the neighborhood of our school can be noticed because of motivated and confident students.\r\nLong-term benefits can be proven by similar European projects the Foundation has been involved in since 2008.

Official Labour Market Statistics show that Doncaster has an unemployment rate of 9.8%, compared with 8.5% within the region and 6.8% national average; 22.9% of the population has qualifications at NVQ level 4 and above, compared with 30.0% within the region and 35.2% of the national average. Additionally, the average weekly salary in Doncaster is \u00a3482.80, whilst nationally this figure is \u00a3520.80.  (www.nomisweb.co.uk) This has resulted in a young generation that suffers from low self-confidence, little motivation, poverty of experience, limited knowledge of the job market and lack of experience of other cultures. Many of our students have had no experience of foreign travel and often have little experience of travel even around the UK.. For this reason, the duration of a 2-week work placement has been selected to provide a \u201cbite-sized\u201d period of experience of other cultures. From previous experience, we know that these projects will undoubtedly provide students with increased self-confidence and self-esteem, as well as broadened horizons and greater intercultural skills; participants will learn the importance of the transferability of skills, which further enhances their chances of employment.Within this context and background, the objective of the the TRADES 5 project is to continue the work of previous mobility projects of broadening the horizons of parochially minded young people whilst improving their employability. We seek to achieve this through students gaining new knowledge, skills and competences, as well as building self-confidence and raising aspirations through the opportunity of living and working in another country. Participation in the mobility project will add value to the students' training programme, by embedding an overseas work placement into the curriculum and will also impact positively on retention and achievement rates at the college through increased motivation, self-confidence and self-esteem. Furthermore, the experience abroad will give the students a unique selling point when they enter the job market, particularly if the job is in the Doncaster area, where such global skills are a rarity. The college delivers its mainstream provision via 3 work streams: preparation for work, progression in work, and returning to work. This project will assist those students who have yet to enter the job market as well as those who are looking to progress. This proposed mobility project will offer the students another avenue through which to achieve this goal. This mobility project provides an invaluable opportunity for the young people to start to build international contacts and gain a greater awareness of the world around them. Over the two-year project period, we will send 24 students to Link\u00f6ping, Sweden in the areas of Childcare, Construction, and Animal Care and 8 Catering students to Gijon, Spain. Additionally, 16 accompanying people will join the students.  Students will undertake a 2-week work placement in an external company within their chosen vocational field. They will work alongside members of staff from the host country, participating in all normal day-to-day activities of the company. Their progress will be monitored and recorded by the accompanying staff member and a designated member of staff at the host company. Students will also self-assess themselves at specific intervals throughout the mobility via evaluation forms in the Student Logbook, such they will be able to clearly see their own progress, in their own words. Cultural activities will take place outside of working hours. We envisage significant professional and personal impacts on the participants. This project aims to give students a more holistic understanding of their chosen vocation, and thereby equally increasing their global employability skills. Moreover, students will gain new skills and knowledge that would not be feasible form the UK due to differences/limitations in resources and regulations; this will be key for their future employability. The long-term benefits of TRADES 5 are expected to have an impact both on an organisational and participant level. From an organisation standpoint it will increase our European profile, thus leading to new collaborations within Europe and beyond to further enhance our international provision.  From a participant level, as we have previously seen in past participants, the long-term benefits of even a two-week mobility are immense; the students gain insight into their own capabilities as professional members of the global workforce, and grow on a personal level that is not possible whilst only remaining in their home country.

A new position has been created in our College, the VET Mobilities Coordinator. This coordinator is part of a team of 5 Hospitality and Tourism lecturers in charge of planning and organizing all the activities related to the mobilities and their promotion. This team is highly qualified and hold long experience in these fields.\r\n\r\nFrom its creation the Erasmus Team has managed to create new partnerships with educational vocational training colleges located in Doncaster in the United Kingdom, Le Havre in France and Norrk\u00f6ping in Sweden. All of them have a high quality level of education. These colleges have a vast experience in European projects and the same tarjets of La Rosaleda.

This is a unique experience to know other cultures and languages, achieving personal, professional and social skills, which will help them through their lives.\r\n- Combating youth unemployment in our region, giving our students more job opportunities abroad and better future integration possibilities.\r\n- Giving the same opportunities to disadvantaged students who come from lower-income backgrounds.\r\n- Achieving greater motivated and experienced teachers, both in terms of languages, educational, cultural or new technologies knowledge. They would be able to design more attractive activities in their classroom for the benefit of students.\r\n- Getting the internationalization of La Rosaleda, which will increase the academic quality level.\r\n- Producing greatest impact of our learning mobilities of individuals not only in our college and city, but also in our region, country and Europe, creating unique experiences and common knowledge.\r\n- Achieving the objectives of all our VET courses, which include an internship at the end of the second academic year.\r\nTo achieve our mobilities main goals has been designed a schedule of all the activities over the academic year. In this schedule the main aspects are: the selections of the students and the teachers, the organization of the mobilities with our partners, carrying out the mobilities, the dissemination of results and the complete evaluation of the programme. \r\nThe evaluation is a relevant issue to ensure the quality of the programme. The analysis of the results of the Higher Education mobilities carried out last academic year has allowed to make some changes and improve our planning. The participants have commited to develop some actions in order to achieve the greatest impact. Some of the planned activities are workshops or seminars directed by the teachers, and the participation in open houses by students. Additionally we will post on a blog and social media networks all the results of the project. \r\n\r\nWe focus this project on 4 VET courses to ensure 14 mobilities of work placements for students, in order to ensure quality experiences to all participants. These courses are Food and Beverage Services (English bilingual context), Cookery, Commercial Activities and Interior Works, Decoration and Rehabilitation. In some of these studies customer care and language skills play an important role, which makes internationalization a necessity.
