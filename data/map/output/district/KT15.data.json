The Internet architecture designed in the 1960's has been supporting a variety of applications and offering a number of services till now but emerging applications demand better quality, programmability, resilience and protection. Any alterations to the Internet architecture have become restricted to simple incremental updates and plug-ins instead of radical changes by introducing new solutions. RINA is an emerging clean-slate programmable networking approach, centring on Inter-Process Communication (IPC) paradigm, which will support high scalability, multi-homing, built-in security, seamless access to real-time information and operation in dynamic environments. The heart of this networking structure is naturally formed and organised by blocks of containers called 'Distributed Information Facilities - DIFs' where each block has programmable functions to be attributed to as they required. A DIF is seen as an organizing structure, grouping together application processes that provide IPC services and are configured under the same policies. Virtualization is a fundamental attribute of the architecture itself. Based on the above fundamental aspect, PRISTINE intends to:\u0095 Design and implement the innovative internals of this clean-slate architecture that include the programmable functions for: security of content and application processes, supporting QoS and congestion control in aggregated levels, providing protection and resilience, facilitating more efficient topological routing, and multi-layer management for handling configuration, performance and security.\u0095 Demonstrate the applicability and benefits of this approach and its built-in functions in three use-cases driven by the service providers and vendors in the consortium.

This seriously handicaps their lives,\ndisabling them of doing routine daily activities, such as driving and even walking. The associated total costs are\naround 60.000 million euros in Europe. It is estimated that at least 100 million people worldwide could benefit\nfrom a vestibular implant as an effective solution to this disease. Restoring the function of the vestibular\nlabyrinths was not possible until now. Current devices, under research, detect change in angular velocity of the\ncephalic movements through gyroscopes and use this information to stimulate the semicircular canals. However,\nthey do not code vertical and horizontal accelerations, used to sense gravitational forces, keep a stand up position\nand restore the sense of self-position. Linear accelerations are detected by a different set of structures which are a\nmore complex and harder to access: the saccule and utricle. This project will develop the first system to\nelectrically reproduce linear accelerations in the otolith organ by stimulating their neural ends. The project will\nhave three phases: Device design, fabrication and clinical trial. Therefore, the objectives will be: 1) to study, for\nthe first time, vestibular pathways through electrical saccule-utricle stimulation; 2) to develop a vestibular\nresponse telemetry system to analyse the evoked action potential of vestibular nerve; 3) to design, manufacture\nand test the first vestibular prosthesis that restores the sense of linear accelerations.

It enables computing navigation solutions with on-board computers to be available for post-2020 missions autonomously from Ground. To do so, the data throughput provided by the sensors is pre-processed (filtering, compression, correction of distortions) by dedicated boards within I3DS. I3DS provides also an abstraction of the many electrical interfaces of the sensors by centralising the data flux using dedicated communication nodes. The mechanical interface is also simplified through the integration of the different sensors and boards in an integrated module.\n\nThe I3DS design enables easy and low-cost configurations and reconfigurations of a robotic platform for any mission using the modular sensors.

People with tinnitus, continuously hear a penetrating phantom sound in absence of actual sound. An estimated 50.8 million EU citizens hear tinnitus, of which 5.1 million are severely bothered by it. Tinnitus can totally disrupt normal societal participation. Hence, tinnitus leads to enormous societal costs (\u20ac140 billion per year in Europa), mainly due to loss of productivity. Since tinnitus primary occurs at advanced age (>50 years), it is a severe challenge to the European ambition to continued inclusion of the aging population in the work force. To date, the research into tinnitus has progressed almost nowhere in the development of effective and reliable treatments for tinnitus. The applicants of the current proposal are convinced that in order to cure tinnitus, we need researchers that can bridge the gap between basic fundamental research, applied clinical research and product development. The major aim of the proposal is to train 15 future scientists who understand how basic neural mechanisms of tinnitus can be studied in animal models and human tinnitus patients, and how complementary research techniques can be used towards curing tinnitus. The central hypothesis of TIN-ACT is that reduced peripheral auditory input (via hearing loss) causes pathological changes centrally in the brain that manifest as the perception of tinnitus. In a balanced consortium, the research is organized in three scientific work packages that study how these pathological changes can be assessed, what causes them, and how they can be treated.
