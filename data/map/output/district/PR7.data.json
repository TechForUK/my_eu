Among the listed actions there is the promotion of low pesticide-input\nmanagement including non-chemical methods. In parallel several chemical active ingredients have been banned because of\ntoxicity concerns. The result is that growers are left with few control tools against pests. On the other hand most of the\navailable alternative control methods have several limitations, especially in term of efficacy. Several new ideas are not\nreaching the industry and are confined in the academic would. The concept behind this EIT is to explore new approaches to\nidentify new cutting edge solutions for pest control based on new non classical approaches in strict collaboration with\nindustrial partner and to train 10 highly skilled early stage researchers (ESR) through a doctoral programme that integrates 5\nacademic research with concept-driven product development in 5 EU companies with a strong curriculum in development\nand innovation within a large interdisciplinary environment. Microorganisms are often used so far as replacement of chemical\nactive ingredients. The innovative aspect of this EID is to base the new pest control solutions on interactions of\nmicroorganisms with plants and insects rather than using them as plant protection products.

We will be able to acquire better learning strategies and more authentic and relevant resources. In addition to this, we will develop a link with the school in Spain and Germany. We will provide children with opportunities to regularly communicate with their Spanish and German partners through the use of ICT and eTwinning. This will give them a real audience, purpose and context of the communication and allow them to get to know young people of their own age in these countries and realise that they have a lot in common. This will lead to better enjoyment of language learning and more uptake of languages at GCSE and above.\r\n\r\nThis project will increase the  language skills and intercultural knowledge of staff leading to more purposeful, relevant learning. There will be better support for children on our pupil premium register to narrow their performance gap and a vast increase in pupils cultural awareness and global citizenship.\r\n\r\nWe will develop school trips and exchanges to Spain and Germany and increase provision including extracurricular clubs and celebration events.
