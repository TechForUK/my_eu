We will create and symbiotically use natural eco-materials for healthier indoor environments through hygrothermal (heat and moisture) regulation and the removal airborne contaminants through both chemical capture and photocatalysis. Our objectives include advancing state of the art in the technology and application of multifunctional bio-based insulation materials, vapour permeable and hygrothermal and moisture buffering finishes, together with wood panel products, to create both internal partition and external highly insulated wall panels. Novel chemical treatments and processes will be used to enhance volatile organic compound capture capacity of materials. We will also develop highly novel photocatalytic coatings using nanoparticle technology, which will be suitable for use in interior spaces and compatible with lime and wooden surfaces. Novel material development will be completed in partnership with world-class expert organisations in indoor environmental quality. We will also create a new holistic modelling framework that combines air quality, hygrothermal comfort and acoustic quality for the well-being of building users. We will take new products through to proof of concept development with prototype manufacture, large scale tests and pilot studies. We will deliver products with at least 15% lower embodied energy, at least 20% longer life, and, for at least 20% lower build costs. Our consortium brings together a multi-disciplinary team of world-class researchers from universities and research organisations with a number of large enterprises and innovative SMEs, whose combined expertise and capacity will lead commercial development and exploitation of our products. We will engage with stakeholders, including Public and Health authorities and standards committees, and deliver training and technical guidance.", 142995.0, 7492835.0, 9, 20, "ECO-SEE", null, "http://wwww.blackmountaininsulation.com", null, "fp7_108954_949756392"]]}}, "8LZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Alla ricerca di soluzioni", "St Mary's C of E Primary School", 105433.0, 3, 3, "The primary need among the teachers, emerged from a Survey made at IC Scocchera , is that to be trained in foreign languages (English), in Great Britain, (in communicative skills and new approaches: CLIL, debate, flipped classroom)  . After getting a basic competence in English our teachers will be able to keep in contact with European partners, to share and find new teaching methods which may lead to a meaningful change, from a too traditional way of teaching to a more effective teaching-learning approach. In the logics-mathematics area a lack in new practices comes into evidence in every day school routines. A mind used to understand, make up, pose and solve problems is required; interests, attitudes and values should be brought to everyday life at school in order to reach (acquire) lifelong skills and competences in problem solving. These new good practices are to be used and applied in any of the different teaching areas. Problem solving method has its core in the management   of any type of situation seen as a \u201cproblem\u201d to solve in order to enhance euristic abilities and self evaluating competences in teachers, pupils and students.\r\nThis Project involves three European schools (Italy, England and Czech Republic) which have been working together through e.twinning platform. Their aim is to share, train, and experience problem solving methods through Hejny, Montessori  and \u201cSenza Zaino\u201d methods, (for example). Coding method will be developed, too, to enrich logics and problem solving skills. These routes will be the basis for the building up of Learning Units, based on real tasks; their objective is getting a good level in the (eight) European key competences , first of all learning to learn.\r\nThe teachers  and\u201d not teaching\u201d school workers involved every year in the project are the following:\r\n14 teachers for the English language competence in the first year of the project;\r\n14 teachers for the same purpose in the second year (28 teachers in total);\r\n4 teachers, the Headmister and the Secretary Office Director for the jobshadowing project .\r\nThe participation of the Headmister and of the Secretary office Director will help the school to get a good quality in terms of European approach and internationalization, through an exchange of management and administration procedures. Detailed reports are scheduled at the end of each planned session, in agreement with the European partners. The impact of the project is planned and previewed in terms of an enhanced level of competence in logics-mathematics area both for students and for teachers.\r\n\r\nAll the results will be shared and spread  locally through meetings and seminars; after each session (English Language and Job Shadowing) meetings with all the school partners will be held: parents and families, local schools, Municipality Hall, (Museums) will be involved. Events with the partecipation of Mayor and Councilor for Education will contribute to the dissemination of the results  on problem solving and coding.\r\nFurthermore, articles will be published in\u201d specialized\u201d magazines in order to spread the results widely. As for the internationalization of the results the staff of the project will arrange online events on e.twinning platform. \r\nEvaluation will focus on: \r\n - English language competence for the teachers involved  and its impact on their teaching practice;\r\n- problem solving  skills acquired by the teachers involved in jobshadowing project and its impact on all the teachers of the school;\r\n- level of internationalization and cooperation with European partners in the learning/ teaching practice.", "http://stmarysschoolburnham.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047361_2"], [2018, "Problem Solving in Maths - sharing strategies and ideas", "St Mary's C of E Primary School", 14460.0, 3, 3, "This project 'Problem Solving in Maths - Developing Strategies and Ideas'  was started in order to find creative and successful ways to develop teaching and learning strategies across our school, in order to develop our pupils' resilience and self-esteem when problem-solving. The three project members , all primary schools, are from England, Italy and the Czech Republic. They are all keen to discover alternative and creative ways to improve learning within their own schools, as well as increasing enjoyment and participation within lessons.  The project will take place over two years, and will involve each school visiting each of their partner schools once a year. Staff members will jobshadow host staff as a way of finding out about the innovative teaching and learning strategies each school is currently using.\r\nThe expected outcomes of this project, are that :\r\nPupils will have been shown alternative techniques and skills to help them become more successful at finding solutions to problems independently. \r\nPupils' understanding of the world around them will have improved, and they will have a more open view of those who appear different to them. \r\nThe school will have developed links with schools from other countries, and pupils will have learnt about those countries in detail. They will have had opportunities to communicate with students and teachers from partner schools, and will have learnt some of their language and ways of life, leading to a more tolerant and respectful attitude towards others. \r\nStaff competencies  will have been developed, along with an increased desire to explore new methods of teaching. \r\nThe long-term aims are:\r\nTo support learners in the acquisition of learning outcomes (knowledge, skills and competencies) with a view to improving their personal development, their involvement as considerate and active citizens in society and their employability in the European labour market and beyond;\r\nTo support the professional development of school staff with a view to innovating and improving the quality of teaching within own school and across the local area.\r\nTo raise pupils' and teachers' awareness and understanding of other cultures and countries, offering them the opportunity to\r\nbuild networks of international contacts, to actively participate in society and develop a sense of European citizenship and identity.", "http://stmarysschoolburnham.org.uk", "St Mary's C of E Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047329_coordinator"]]}}}}
