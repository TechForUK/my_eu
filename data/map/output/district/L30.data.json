It is conducted by El Pilar Salesian School. This is a school with 1200 students and 90 teachers. We teach Kindergarten, Primary, Secondary, Vocational Training and Higher Education students. \r\n\r\nThe Project is part of the plans for improving the quality of education and innovation of the school . The aims of the Project are to improve teachers\u2019 training and to provide them with innovative methodologies, ICT tools and new approaches for teaching languages. \r\n\r\nThe project involves the participation of 17 teachers from the school from all educational stages in different training actions, both in the three job visits (job-shadowing) and the five structured courses that we will perform.\r\nJob-Shadowings will be done in associated schools placed in Italy, Germany and United Kingdom. There will be eight teachers involved in these visits which are focused in direct observation about different topics:\r\n- The use of active methodologies in class (Flipped Classroom in CNOS-FAP, Italy).\r\n- Language teaching (CLIL methodology and multilingual project in Helene-Lange Realschule, Germany)\r\n- Subject specialization (Business School in Savio College, UK).\r\n\r\nStructured Courses are focused on the different areas of improvement that were detected while analysing the developmental needs of the school. There will be nine teachers participating in these structured courses:\r\n- \"Structured Visit to Schools in Finland\" This course is about  school organization and active methodologies in the Finnish education system including the Kyva program against bullying.\r\n- \u201cNumicon\u201d course works on manipulative Maths teaching in Key Stage 1 & 2.\r\n- \u201cCreative use of Technology\u201d and \u201cIntegrating ICT in teaching\u201d courses try to provide teachers the apps and knowledge they need to use ICT properly in their classes.\r\n- \u201cMontessori Educational Methodologies\u201d course is thought to help teachers to implement this methodology in their schools. \r\n\r\nWe hope that all these training actions will improve the quality of teaching in our center and make it a benchmark in innovation in the area. To this end, the participating teachers will carry out dissemination and cascade activities among their peers and with the teachers of the municipal schools. Furthermore, they will publish the results in the educational nets our school is involved in (European Salesian Schools and Catholic Schools in Madrid). We also hope to help consolidate the innovation processes at the center and the European dimension of education that we have been working on during the last five years in our school. Finally, we hope that these training actions will lead to future European projects (exchanges, etwinning, knowledge alliances,\u2026) with our partners and the new contacts we will make in the courses we will be participating  in.", "http://www.saviosalesiancollege.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA101-037669_2"], ["2NA", "EUROWORKERS: Innovation, Inclusion and ICT in school to develop key competences  for the laboural market.", "Savio Salesian College", 88496.0, "The EUROWORKERS project was born with the aim of sharing the good practices of the four schools in the fields of teaching innovation, language learning, social inclusion, the development of entrepreneurship and the prevention of early school leaving . This is why it seeks to develop through active methodologies such as Project Learning (PBL) the key competences of students while providing them with tools for the continuation of their studies and their future incorporation into the labor market. Among these key competences, one of the most fundamental is the learning of the languages. We also understand that a practical and real approach to the labor and business market will help the development of their entrepreneurial spirit. Finally, in a context such as the current one, we consider it crucial to develop policies and processes of social inclusion, especially with refugees.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to improve the development of the basic skills of students, especially foreign language fluency, digital competence and entrepreneurship. We also hope that the project will help prevent early school leaving and facilitate the inclusion and integration of pupils with special educational needs and refugee pupils.\r\n\r\nThe project is aimed at secondary and high school students from the Salesian schoolss el Pilar, Helene-Lange_Schule, Savio College and Lycee Don Bosco. In total, 240 students and 40 teachers from different areas will participate in the project's development. A part of the project includes short periods of exchange in which 18 students from each center will participate.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of planning, setting up and maintaining a Virtual Human Resource Business by the students of each country involved. Starting with the first ideas until the complete development of the business, the project will be divided as such.\r\nThe project is made up of four phases, which correspond to each of the countries involved. Each of these phases delves into work methods, knowledge of cultures and in the study of the business fabric in each country. Since this is such a multidisciplinary project, it will deal with different subjects, while using and working in English or Spanish (these languages are studied in all schools) and in some cases, French and German. Each phase is divided into four areas:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Entrepreneurship: construction and management of the Human Resource Business.\r\n\u2022 ICT: web development and video blog\r\n\u2022 Labour market: approach to the business world and preparation for work experience\r\n\u2022 Language and culture: knowledge of culture of each country and practise of  the language with native colleagues\r\n\r\nThroughout the project, a website, video blog, and a TwinSpace on the eTwinning platform will be maintained. Each country will have someone responsible for ICT and a group of students in charge of these tasks.\r\n\r\nWe will use Project Based Learning (PBL) and Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) methodologies throughout the project development. Furthermore, the project is focused in key competences development into the EU framework (Recommendation 2006/962/EC on key competences for lifelong learning). However, one of the pillars of the project is the work-based learning, this is the reason why we have included a short exchange and training period in each country for some students participating in the project.\r\n\r\nThe results expected for students is an improvement in their key competences (specially language skills, management of ICT and entrepreneurial spirit). On the the School and the teachers an improvement in teaching skills and in new methodologies implementation is expected. Finally, for the educational community, at the end and during the process are expected to have developed educational materials to be made available through the eTwinning platform and the nets every school belongs to. \r\nFinally there is an expected impact in the different local areas through the partners enterprises. The experience will benefit them as they will strength the relationship with Training providers. \r\n\r\nA sustainable relationship betwen the schools and a reinforcement of the languages, ICT and entrepreneurship teaching is desiderable as a long term benefit of the project.", "http://www.saviosalesiancollege.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA219-038624_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L30"}
