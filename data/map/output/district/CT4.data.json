Our proprietary middleware allows us to produce custom components directly from digital 3D models, eliminating the need for manual programming and maximizing production speed.\nThrough our groundbreaking technology we currently enable thousands of consumers to build their house interior exactly as they imagine it from custom wardrobes and cabinets to bed-frames and doors, all with a few clicks on our 3D design tool. We have successfully marketed this technology and have made it available through our website.\nHouseBuildR is bold step forward. It comprises a sophisticated large-scale CNC machine, capable of producing plywood blocks in custom geometries of sufficient size to be used in house building. It is thus ideal for self-builders, i.e. people who prefer to build their houses from scratch, a market segment that accounts for almost 640,000 new houses in the EU and the US. \nOur vision is clear. We aim to completely redefine Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) based house construction by adapting our technology to achieve end-to-end house building automation. This new paradigm will not only enable end-customers to design and self-build their homes themselves but also drive the construction costs down by at least 20%.\nOur solution enables a transition to energy efficient houses with greatly reduced carbon footprint. Houses built with HouseBuildR will feature 2.5 times more effective insulation due to inherent qualities of plywood SIP. This will result in an estimated CO2 reduction of 4391 tonnes per year.\nThrough this action, we aim to fund a feasibility study for our product, which is already at TRL6, and establish the estimated potential of our business growing by \u20ac31m gross revenues and \u20ac13.7m operating profits over the 5 years following HouseBuildR\u2019s official market launch, generating a total of approximately 195 direct and 1100 indirect jobs.", 43972.0, 62817.0, "HouseBuildR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213698_924156831"], ["8AU", "An innovative fruit ripeness checker, to offer non-destructive testing in order to ensure resource efficient fruit processing - Ripesense", "North Court Fruit Farm", "Fresh\u2019 fruits for the consumer market can only be sold as such if they are shown to be a certain standard of \u2018ripeness\u2019, as judged by the sugar content and firmness. There is great commercial pressure on producers to provide produce which is of the appropriate standard. Apples which do not meet this standard can be sold to the wholesale market or juiced with losses to market value of 50% and 95% respectively, but apples & citrus fruits which are destructively tested are sold as animal feed, composted or sent to landfill. \nAs a result, fruits are tested many times during the production cycle, both in harvesting and distribution. Unfortunately, the most widely used tests for both are destructive tests. This leads to the destruction of between 6 \u2013 8% of harvested apples and approximately 5% of citrus fruits for testing purposes. Worldwide, this would amount to 4.6 \u2013 6.1 million tonnes of apples and 6.6 million tonnes of citrus fruit annually. At average European prices, this represents a combined economic loss of \u20ac6.3 \u2013 7.2 billion every year. \nRipesense is an innovative solution to this problem.

As a result it influences in a radical way the economies of energy dependent countries, as it is Greece which on one hand spends enormous amounts of hard currency for the import of fossil fuels and on the other hand presents in the level of electricity production and final use, a picture of non efficient utilization of the various energy systems.\r\n \r\nThe institutional framework of the European Union binds the members states for the enforcement- implementation  of Energy saving programs in the following directions\r\n1.     The existence of governmental programs for the promotion of energy investments in the wider public sector\r\n2.     The  creation of new energy regulations and models\r\n3.     The energy performance  certification of buildings\r\n4.     The energy inspections of  installations\r\n5.     The rational pricing of energy\r\n\r\nThe margins for energy management improvement and efficiency in our country, Greece are enormous since there is a great waste of energy as it is proved by the Energy intensity indicators (units of energy per unit of GDP) that ranks/ classifies          Greece in the worst place in Europe right next to Portugal.\r\nThe energy management aims at the rational use of energy and financial resourses and at supporting functional objectives of the management of a building  by means of specific organizing actions and techno-financial measures. However, in order to ensure its benefits on a continuous basis, it is required a systematic organized and continuous process of knowledge, evaluation, observation and improvement of the real energy state of a building and its users behavior.\r\nIn addition the successful application of this process presupposes a contemporary framework of energy policy, a complete strategic approach and staffing  the institutions with well trained Energy Personnel\r\nSome  examples of successful practices that could be adopted by the public institutions are the following: Energy inspections of building installations, the use of suitable sensors and softwares, the energy certificates, the choice and funding of new sustainable/viable energy technologies, the co- productions of heat and electricity by means of natural gas, the interventions of replacement of light arrays with new low consumption lights, the complete application of bioclimatic architecture, the use of central solar systems and the central equipment of retrieving and storing heat.\r\nTaking into account the efforts that have been made  in the past few years for establishing and applying acontemporary /up-to-date institutional framework in terms of saving energy in building, the public sector has to be the first to respond in introducing procedures and implementing measures for improving the energy efficiency of building infrastructures.\r\nTherefore the public sector is called to introduce new organizational and financial schemes as well as new energy technologies and software in its buildings setting in this way the example for the rest of the users.\r\nFor all the above reasons the submission of this particular proposition  is essential.", "http://www.easgroup.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-EL01-KA102-000436_1"], ["5ET", "\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b2\u03ad\u03bb\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b5\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2  \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd 1000 m2)", "Electrical Assessment Services UK Limited", 18067.0, "The present action consists of the certified training of 16 teachers from the 1st Laboratory Center of Larissa (Electrical, Electronic, Mechanical) of higher technical education from Greece by ELECTRICAL ASSESSMENT SERVICES Ltd in the United Kingdom, providing training in electrical and engineering installations in large business premises (over 1000 m2) in the United Kingdom and generally large buildings.
