Therefore there have been a number of non-destructive techniques developed to inspect, monitor and detect impurities and defects within products in production lines. Existing inspection tools such as X-ray imaging have been used to inspect engineering materials and food products but are subject to health and safety issues as well as large equipment footprint and high cost resulting in unsuitability for many inspection situations. \nStructural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection techniques are also of great importance in the offshore, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering communities, both for safety reasons and because of the economic benefits that can result. The need to be able to detect damage in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of non-destructive techniques (NDT), of which many are based upon structural vibration analysis. However, the majority of NDT systems for SHM are slow, costly and require long periods of downtime to complete. They also struggle to give structural information on near surface (<10 mm) layers. \nWe have developed an innovative and new form of NDT, based on Near Infrared (NIR) inline inspection and detection of defects, which has been validated for non-metallic engineering materials and is capable of providing a rapid, more informative and cost effective NDT solution for composite manufacturers and end users. \nThe NIR-PERFECT project will therefore develop a more robust business plan for this new NIR NDT inspection and monitoring system.

We believe that volunteer activism in developing grassroots sports is the most successful and innovative way to engage young people in healthy lifestyles, demonstrate and promote healthy behaviours and create opportunities for them. \r\n\r\nThe youth exchange will bring together 56 young people and 8 youth leaders equally representing the UK, Bulgaria, Turkey and Estonia to Antalya, Turkey for 11 days.\r\n\r\nThe concrete objectives of the exchange will include: promoting healthy behaviours, social inclusion and active participation of young people in society; advancing the level of young people's participation in volunteering for inclusion of disadvantaged youth through outdoor activities and grassroots sports; creating presentations in promoting the concept of sports volunteering and volunteer activism in developing grassroots sports in a creative way; increasing the participation by young people with fewer opportunities in the civic life of their community.\r\n\r\nThe young people - participants of the exchange will have different experiences in intercultural contacts from nil to quite experienced peer leaders and ex EVS volunteers.

As a result of the final workshops practiced there youngsters came to the conclusion that responsibility means that they must learn how to influence important public decisions in the field of ecological environment protection that affect them in many ways. However, this was noticed to be a challenging issue that should be explored with the help of relevant non-formal methodologies and appropriate scope of activities within the frameworks of a specialised project targeting deprived urban areas as they are mostly disposed to ecological risks and hazards. \r\n\r\nWith this project our partnership aims to give an opportunity to young people from deprived urban areas of the UK, Turkey, Belarus and Moldova to find out more about possible dangers of ignoring environmental problems that our communities face and learn how to keep a close watch on potentially dangerous actions and policies by initiating participation projects. The project will help the young people to learn about dangers of man-made actions for the environment and equip them with tools to participate in environmental solutions.

With the youth exchange \u201cNEETing the change\u201d our partnership consisting of partner organisations from the UK, Lithuania, Latvia, and Turkey is aiming to empower young people for community participation and equipping them with skills to overcome NEET situation.The project intends to explore the current situation regarding unemployment in Europe, the conditions under which young people live, their educational background, the match (or mismatch) between their studies and what they want to do in their lives. The facilitators will equip young people with tools that allow them to identify their talents, their skills, their interests and passions in order to get employed (or self-employed). The need to provide sustainable rather than temporary solutions will be explicitly discussed and practiced. Young talents will be inspired and empowered to practice social inclusion, work with community and overcome NEET situation. The exchange will also engage young people in creating community projects (on national or international level) in which they will put in practice the tools and skills gained during workshops.During the preparatory phase, 2 representatives of each partner organisation will come to Latvia for the Advance Planning Visit to discuss the project's logistical part, make risk assessment, to see the venue and to plan thoroughly for successful programming. The 12 days youth exchange (to take place from the 20th June to the 1st July, 2016) will bring together 14 young people and 2 group leaders from each partner organisation involved to Riga, Latvia.

By using knowledge and experience got during the previous projects and involving suitable methods, we will give the possibility for  the exchange participants to meet for exploring volunteering as a strong tool to support their ideas and spread their message far and wide and to practice ecological/environmental volunteering as part of the field work activity.As a culmination of the exchange participants will come together in several mixed nationality groups to practice ecological/environmental volunteering. Another goal of the exchange is to stimulate active behaviour of local youth organisations in relation to environmental challenges, so that they take significant part in the process.

So while the economy is apparently doing better, that's not actually what's happening for young people from linguistic minority communities.The innovativeness of this project is in its aim to promote social inclusion and active youth participation by empowering peers to address these issues in their immediate daily peer group environment of different linguistic minorities suffering from unemployment and social exclusion.The youth exchange will involve 16 participants from each of the partner groups in the UK, Italy, Latvia and Portugal and will take place in Catania, Italy for 10 days.The target group for this exchange project is young people from linguistic minority families who face employment, educational and /or training difficulties, including those with a difficult social/economic background. This target group have fewer opportunities to participate in any exchanges and get intercultural understanding. They do not possess  sufficient resources to get international experience. But empowering them to set socially valuable goals and giving them instruments to reach these goals will make our partner European communities healthier, more human and inclusive.With this project we want to promote non-formal ways of communication between groups of linguistic minority young people coming from different European countries by letting them share their skills and achievements with other young people in a NEET situation in peer-led workshops. It includes the youth participation aspect as it is strongly present in non-formal education, peer leadership and peer education. The objectives of the youth exchange include: sharing innovative visions and practice possible ways of social and community inclusion of linguistic minority youth in a NEET situation by active participation in their local and regional peer-led projects; finding out how the non-formal learning affects the lives of linguistic minority youth in a NEET situation throughout the \u201cNew Europe\u201d and agreeing upon action-centred strategies that help young people to address the issues raised; making progress in recognition of non-formal learning and peer leaders\u2019 inputs and achievements; raising cultural awareness between different countries and promoting cooperation and understanding.One of the project\u2019s aims is to develop cooperation with the participating Erasmus+ Programme countries.

As all Europeans, young people from a migrant background must have a say in the choices made today because they will determine the world we will live in tomorrow. Therefore, active citizenship among young people is a key component of the future of European democracies.The theme of our Youth Exchange is promoting European Citizenship and the rights that go with it among migrant young people using out-of-doors experiential learning methodology, stimulating active participation of young migrants in community life, thus enabling such young people to behave as active, informed citizens.

We plan to conduct a youth exchange focusing on healthy behaviour with a special emphasis on the use of sports volunteering as a sustainable method by which to achieve this goal. The proposed youth project is the result of a collaborative effort by four diverse partners who all bring experience, commitment and enthusiasm to our project's theme.  We will bring together 64 young people from the UK, Portugal, Lithuania, and Turkey to participate in a 10 day Youth Exchange to be held in Portugal that will focus on the promotion of healthy life long behaviours through sports volunteering activities.   Each partner has previously worked on projects related on the promotion of healthy behaviors and the partners  were chosen for this project because it is an area of keen interest to each organisation and each recognizes the need to promote healthy behaviours to a wider and wider audience.

The participants will be young people who will come from regions or communities that give fewer opportunities in social, economic or geographic aspects (peripheral areas). The national economic structures of the countries normally do not offer these young people opportunities to gain international experience.

Young people from partner groups will also prepare artistic, creative workshops related to the project theme that they have designed themselves.

Methods of facilitation will be taken by the preparatory team from the SALTO online toolbox. The exchange will include the full range of non-formal educational methods, starting with a block on team building and icebreaking where the atmosphere and group spirit will be formed and the continuation of the project consists of balanced set of inputs on various aspects of experiential learning , facilitation of European citizenship issues in communication, information and Inter Cultural Learning. The exchange will be finalized by blocks on Erasmus+ programme, some follow-up and future partnership planning and evaluation. During the exchange a special group will also work on the systematization of the findings and tools developed during the project to provide information for the web platform.The European dimension of the project will be developed by all the partners together, as they intend to extend such projects among young people of multinational communities, basing on interlinked educational activities. Non-formal educational means will be taken from on-line SALTO Toolbox and Booklets and adapted for goals of the exchange. This will be done to raise young people\u2019s awareness of European problems and to show how these young people may participate in creating new, united Europe.It is expected that the young people will return to their youth groups and organisations with increased confidence on how to approach European citizenship in peer to peer youth activities. After the youth exchange is over we also expect that new projects and teams will be initiated and formed.

This innovative aspect of thinking will open up new opportunities, give way to an array of creative solutions and help to rethink the exisiting obstacles that hinder the achievement of the desired educational outcomes in the youth field, in promoting the active citizenship at the local level and in implementing new projects. Creative thinking will help to understand how to overcome fears and discouragement that one may experience if facing a challenge, whatever the obstacles: physical or social. The project will bring together partner organizations from the UK, Bulgaria, Portugal, Estonia, and Latvia. The exchange will take place in Sofia, Bulgaria. Each country will be represented by 12 young people and 2 youth peer leaders. The idea can be further developed in local projects after the exchange and serve as an inspiration for developing follow-up projects by the participants who will establish new contacts for future co-operation. Furthermore, the participants will be introduced to a set of brand new methods and tools for generating ideas and developing strategies for successful project implementation, get familiarized with the basic tools in project making/project management. The exchange will shed light on the objectives, strategies, project phases and evaluation guidelines and enable the participants to share their best practices and start the process of developing ideas for future co-operations.The target group for this exchange is young people with lesser socio-economic opportunities motivated to improve their knowledge, skills and understanding to play an effective role in society, to become visible as a members of their communities. In addition, these young people are motivated to become more self-confident and develop a sense of responsibility for themselves as well as their surroundings. Their careful selection is one of the main aspects of this youth exchange to be taken care of by all the partner organisations.The approach used during the exchange itself will be workshop based, which will include discussions, sharing of ideas and practical activity e.g. role play, world caf\u00e9, open spaces etc. to aid learning. Young people from partner groups will also prepare artistic, creative workshops in a medium of their own choice. This will not only provide opportunities for exploring the theme of active citizenship but will also act as a means of inclusion and intercultural learning as they are prepared to run the workshops with mixed nationality groups and also to publicise it to the local young people and public in the vicinity of the exchange. This will also ensure that the young people have been involved in the design and implementation of the programme.The exchange will have a strong non-formal empowerment / training dimension pursued in workshops of World Caf\u00e9, Open Spaces and other strong non-formal education tools. These tools will aim to introduce participants to concepts such as citizenship, human rights, diversity, democracy and civil society.We believe that this project can greatly contribute to the personal development of  participants. In the series of workshops participants will learn:- using imagination to consider the situation of others;- about the barriers to volunteering and active citizenship and ways to overcome those barriers;- analysing the role of community;- the difference between positive and negative action;- that everyone can make a difference;- the variety of ways in which a person can be an active citizen.This project will also have a strong European dimension and stimulate reflection on the emerging European society and its values.

This project is a result of the previous youth encounters between the peer leaders and educators on intercultural learning with the European partner organisations. After these encounters (seminars, training courses) they raised awareness of intercultural problems in modern Europe and now are willing to share innovative visions and practice possible ways of social and community inclusion of unemployed migrant youth by facilitating Intercultural learning process in their local and regional peer led projects. The innovative feature of this project is that we aim at developing the Inter Cultural Learning process by empowering peers to address this issue in their immediate daily peer group environment of multicultural communities suffering from unemployment.  Participants involved in this youth exchange will be youth peer leaders with minority background, coming from deprived urban areas and having experience of being unemployed. The careful selection of the participants is one of the main aspects of this youth exchange to be taken care of by all the partner organisations.

The activity is planned to take place in Rudiskes, Lithuania, with the aim to create transferable models and practices which publicise the idea and values of sports volunteering using creative artistic means. The project will advance the level of young people's participation in volunteering for inclusion of disadvantaged youth through non-competitive games and sports and get insights of what it is to be a sports volunteer in different European countries. During the previous youth encounters partners have revealed a huge interest of local hosting communities towards sports volunteering projects we made and towards the idea of voluntarism in general but little understanding of its principles and values. Therefore, the international partnership of youth organizations represented by young people and youth leaders formed at the previous youth exchange believe it is important to develop a sense of social responsibility, the skills required to be active agents for change and development, and the knowledge required to make informed choices within this context. This project will bring together 12 young people and 2 group leaders from the UK, Lithuania, Portugal, Italy, and Bulgaria including young participants with a difficult social background. We have chosen this target group since they have fewer opportunities to be exchanged and get intercultural understanding. They do not possess  sufficient resources to get international experience. Another factor for choosing them is that young people with fewer opportunities are a very promising group. Empowering them to set socially valuable goals and giving them instruments to reach these goals will make our societies healthier and more humanistic.The programme of youth exchange is composed of the following three main elements:- namely work programme (educational workshops and evaluations), - cultural programme (cultural visits in the locality and Inter Cultural Learning exercises),- evening social programme.The project will start with a block on team\u2013building and ice-breaking where the atmosphere and group spirit will be formed and the continuation of the exchange consists of balanced set of inputs on various aspects of communication, information and Inter Cultural Learning and non-formal education exercises. Open space workshops were chosen to be the base for the work programme as the most efficient creativity boosting method to develop the main theme of the exchange. Options for the cultural programme will be offered for discussions depending on its relevance to the theme of the project and its interest to all the young participants.

So while the economy is apparently doing better, that's not actually what's happening for young people from linguistic minority communities.The innovativeness of this project is in its aim to promote social inclusion and active youth participation by empowering peers to address these issues in their immediate daily peer group environment of different linguistic minorities suffering from unemployment and social exclusion.The youth exchange will involve 12  participants and two leaders from each of the partner groups in the UK, Belarus, Turkey and Azerbaijan and will take place in Baku Azerbaijan for 12 days.The target group for this exchange project are young people from linguistic minority families who face employment, educational and /or training difficulties, including those with a difficult social/economic background. This target group have fewer opportunities to participate in any exchanges and get intercultural understanding. They do not possess  sufficient resources to get international experience. But empowering them to set socially valuable goals and giving them instruments to reach these goals will make our partner European communities healthier, more human and inclusive.With this project we want to promote non-formal ways of communication between groups of linguistic minority young people coming from different European countries. In the midst of the constantly increasing unemployment rates among young people in Europe, there arises a need for innovative strategies aimed at improving young people's chances in the labour market. In the modern world where many organisations work on a multinational level, their future employees are expected to have competences which will enable them to work in an international environment. They are Inter Cultural Learning (ICL) Skills.Many young people get important practical skills in formal education establishments, but at the same time they often lack certain intercultural communication skills. Such skills are also essential to build a successful career. Besides, as modern societies are culturally diverse, the ability to successfully cooperate with people with different cultural backgrounds became a truly important both in private life and in the professional field.Therefore, our partnership discussed an opportunity to undertake this International Mobility Project involving a specific target group - young people from national, ethnic and linguistic minority groups - in order to provide them with a basic set of essential inter cultural communication competences that will both boost their chances in the labour market and contribute to their social and cultural development. Our Youth Exchange will be focused on developing employability skills of national, ethnic and linguistic minority youth and enabling them to explore inter cultural learning (ICL) principles. At the same time, non-formal education methods will be promoted.A balanced set of theoretical and practical sessions will enable the partnership to achieve the objectives set for the project. These objectives include:- Sharing realities and exploring the existing situation with unemployment of national, ethnic and linguistic minority youth;- To find common ground in the issues related to inter cultural learning as the key to employability and development of such skills;- To find possible ways of including national, ethnic and linguistic minority youth in social life by developing their inter cultural learning and social skills;- To discover the effect of inter cultural learning on numerous aspects of a young person\u2019s life;- To discuss and understand how social inclusion and employment policies in the participating countries influence us as citizens;- To discuss how non-formal education can positively influence youth employability and to discover examples of best employment practices related to young people having national, ethnic and linguistic minority background;- To empower participants to become active citizens;- To encourage the young people to become examples to their peers;- To present the Erasmus+ programme and to encourage the creation of future projects with young people having national, ethnic and linguistic minority background as the target group.After the Youth Exchange the participants will be encouraged to act as multipliers, applying the newly obtained knowledge with their peers in their local communities.", "http://www.wayc.org.uk", "Warwickshire Association of Youth Clubs", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024755_coordinator"], ["3JE", "Empowering youth from deprived urban areas to participate in environmental solutions", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", 31189.0, "With this project our partnership aims to give an opportunity to young people from deprived urban areas of the UK, Latvia, Portugal, and Sweden to find out more about possible dangers of ignoring environmental problems that our communities face and learn how to keep a close watch on potentially dangerous actions by initiating participation projects.

During the workshops on what European citizenship (EC) means for representatives of different corners of Europe it was highlighted that EC is perceived as a feeling of historical, social and cultural bonds to the continent sharing its common past, present and future rather than any political union.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this exchange is promoting EC and the rights that go with it through youth entrepreneurship initiatives using social responsibility approach, thus enabling young people to act as active, informed citizens. This implies that the exchange will develop certain attitudes and skills both in young people and peer leaders to improve European citizenship education through youth entrepreneurship initiatives in peer-to-peer youth work as well as to explore and to understand active youth participation approach to youth citizenship education.\r\n\r\nThe 10 days Activity will bring together 10 young people and 2 group leaders from the UK, Portugal, Latvia, Italy, and Turkey to Porto, Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n \r\n1. To explore and understand the meaning of active citizenship for young people in old and new EU member states as well as Turkey. \r\n2 To develop attitudes and skills of young people and peer leaders for improving citizenship education through socially responsible entrepreneurship initiatives . \r\n3. To increase understanding how non-formal learning can enable and develop those skills and attitudes of young people (reflect on principles of non-formal learning through practical exercises and reflection sessions).\r\n4. To raise awareness of the need for youth citizenship education through socially responsible entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will initiate new youth participation projects with young people having economic and employment problems in order for them to become motivated and trained in youth citizenship issues through socially responsible entrepreneurship using  empowerment and inclusion methodologies.\r\n\r\nThe project methodology will be based on active youth participation approach.

Social exclusion of young people, in particular youth in a NEET situation, can have negative consequences for the economy and significant costs for Europe. According to the latest research made by Eurofound, the economic loss due to the disengagement of young people from the labour market is over 150 billion euro.

Based on these findings and conclusions our partnership of youth organisations from the UK, Lithuania, Latvia, and Turkey decided to undertake this multilateral youth exchange aiming at promotion of social inclusion and active citizenship of young people in NEET situation by empowering them to initiate, design and organize specific creative and innovative grass-root projects and activities for the communities they live in. \r\n\r\nThe participants of the exchange will be 10 young people (including those who are not in an employment, education or training situation) and 2 group leaders from the participating organisations.

This time the partners from the UK, Turkey, Estonia, Lithuanua, and Sweden will expand their successul experiences to address young people belonging to national or ethnic minority groups. Participating partner organizations agreed that community inclusion and empowerment of youth representing different national and ethnic minority groups is essential for advancement of solidarity, participation and democracy.  We decided to undertake this youth exchange in Lithuania as its population has been homogeneous for centuries and this Mobility Project will be our joint step towards the inclusive society facing the necessity to adapt and change to new realities.\r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the youth exchange are concentrated around:\r\n\r\n- sharing innovative visions and practicing possible ways of social and community inclusion of youth representing national and ethnic minority groups by facilitating non-formal learning process in their local and regional peer led projects;\r\n- exploring how the non-formal education impacts on the lives of young people representing national and ethnic minority groups throughout the \u201cNew Europe\u201d and agreeing action centered strategies that assist young people to address the issues raised;\r\n- making progress in recognition of non-formal learning and peer leaders\u2019 inputs and achievements;\r\n- encouraging full participation and taking on of responsibility by young people in all aspects of the exchange;\r\n- becoming more aware of the conditions other young people live in and the issues that affect youth representing national and ethnic minority groups both locally and in the rest of Europe, and for them to develop confidence regarding their environment;\r\n- identifying the next steps we need to take to create peer-led education products in minority youth groups inclusion and empowerment. \r\n\r\nThe youth exchange will involve young people and youth leaders from the UK, Turkey, Estonia, Lithuanua, and Sweden (12 pax from each partner country) and will take place in Rudiskes, Lithuania.

Innovative thinking speeds up and improves the very meaning of community volunteering, making it more Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this Mobility project belongs to the young people who feel certain that such international Youth Exchange can create innovation-friendly environment that makes it easier for great ideas to be turned into community-oriented projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will bring together partner organizations from the UK, Estonia, Turkey and Lithuania. The exchange will take place in Lentvaris, Lithuania. Each country will be represented by 15 young people and 3 youth peer leaders. The idea can be further developed in local projects after the exchange and serve as an inspiration for developing follow-up projects by the participants who will establish new contacts for future co-operation. Furthermore, the participants will be introduced to a set of brand new methods and tools for generating ideas and developing strategies for successful project implementation, get familiarized with the basic tools in project making/project management. The exchange will shed light on the objectives, strategies, project phases and evaluation guidelines and enable the participants to share their best practices and start the process of developing ideas for future co-operations.\r\n\r\nThe target group for this exchange is young people with lesser socio-economic opportunities motivated to improve their knowledge, skills and understanding to play an effective role in society, to become visible as a members of their communities. In addition, these young people are motivated to become more self-confident and develop a sense of responsibility for themselves as well as their surroundings. Their careful selection is one of the main aspects of this youth exchange to be taken care of by all the partner organisations.\r\n\r\nThe approach used during the exchange itself will be workshop based, which will include discussions, sharing of ideas and practical activity e.g. role play, world caf\u00e9, open spaces etc. to aid learning. Young people from partner groups will also prepare artistic, creative workshops in a medium of their own choice. This will not only provide opportunities for exploring the theme of active citizenship but will also act as a means of inclusion and intercultural learning as they are prepared to run the workshops with mixed nationality groups and also to publicise it to the local young people and public in the vicinity of the exchange. This will also ensure that the young people have been involved in the design and implementation of the programme.\r\n\r\nThe exchange will have a strong non-formal empowerment / training dimension pursued in workshops of World Caf\u00e9, Open Spaces and other strong non-formal education tools. These tools will aim to introduce participants to concepts such as citizenship, human rights, diversity, democracy and civil society.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this project can greatly contribute to the personal development of  participants. In the series of workshops participants will learn:\r\n\r\n- using imagination to consider the situation of others;\r\n- about the barriers to volunteering and active citizenship and ways to overcome those barriers;\r\n- analysing the role of community;\r\n- the difference between positive and negative action;\r\n- that everyone can make a difference;\r\n- the variety of ways in which a person can be an active citizen.\r\n\r\nThis project will also have a strong European dimension and stimulate reflection on the emerging European society and its values. European dimension of the project will be developed by all the partners together, as they intend to extend such projects among young people of multinational communities, basing on interlinked educational activities. Non-formal educational means taken from online SALTO Toolbox and Booklets and adapted for goals of the exchange. This is done to raise disadvantaged young people\u2019s awareness of European problems and to show how these young people may participate in creating new, united Europe.\r\n\r\nWe are expecting that the workshops will develop a range of innovative ideas for active citizenship through volunteering.

It's a unique opportunity to recognise that we should be united as one European team for our common well-being.\r\n\r\nYoung people representing the participating organisations became the spark thanks to which the Mobility Project was ignited. This project is a youth initiative aimed to prove that non-competitive sports volunteering can be a good way to overcome the existing social and cultural barriers and show how community-oriented sports activities can unite young people from different countries under the common European values.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Exchange will bring together 56 young people and 8 group leaders from the UK, Italy, Romania, and Portugal to Timisoara, Romania for 10 days (17-26 December, 2017).\r\n\r\nBy using knowledge and experience obtained during the previous projects, involving suitable methods, and ensuring that the project is firmly rooted within the local community, we expect that this youth exchange will give the possibility for exchange participants to meet for exploring sports volunteering as a strong tool to support their ideas and spread their message related to healthy behaviours far and wide and to practice healthy lifestyle and sports volunteering as part of the field work activity.\r\n\r\n The objectives of the youth exchange are to:\r\n\r\n- Explore sports volunteering as a strong tool to support participants' ideas and spread their message related to healthy behaviours to their peers;\r\n- Practice sports volunteering as part of the field work activity, thus promoting healthy lifestyle within young people;\r\n- Show young people the significance of youth organisations in promoting healthy lifestyle within the project that incorporates the entire Europe;\r\n- Stimulate teamwork of the participating partners by enabling informal community networks and organisations to evolve this exchange further;\r\n- Keep the project participants aware of European youth programmes and how they can help to promote healthy lifestyles;\r\n- Support personal and organisational development of peer leaders/educators by extending their competences to integrate elements of healthy lifestyles education within their projects, to practice and to support their role as multipliers with young people;\r\n- Spread the message on the advantages of healthy behaviours and lifestyles by publicising the idea of sports volunteering in our communities;\r\n- Provide participants with Youthpass accreditation instruments.\r\n\r\nParticipants from the UK, Italy, Portugal, and Romania are already acquainted as they took part in previous projects with their organisations being involved.

From there, the young people will start to explore their similarities and their differences. This will ultimately lead to better contact and a deeper level of understanding.\r\n\r\nUsing sports volunteering as a method will open up new possibilities for young people to get to know one another and the world around them. Sports activities won't be limited in their impact to just the local level. There are also a range of other possibilities available for sports-related activities and learning opportunities on the European level through Erasmus+ programme.\r\n\r\nAfter the youth exchange, the participants will assist us in creating Social Network Groups in Facebook, Twitter etc. with photos and information on what was done within the exchange to spread this information in their local groups and communities by making presentations and organising workshops.", "http://www.youngpeoplefirst.org.uk", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036917_coordinator"], ["3JE", "Wake up, Green up: Youth for environmental solutions in community participation projects", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", 42559.0, "European youth realise the importance of taking part in environmental solutions as well as in raising awareness about possible dangers of ignoring environmental problems.

The young people - participants of the exchange will have different experiences in intercultural contacts from nil to quite experienced peer leaders and ex EVS volunteers. By using knowledge and experience got during the previous projects and involving suitable methods and ensuring that the project is firmly rooted within the local community, we hope that this youth exchange will give the possibility of reaching out to young people representing different national and ethnic minority groups widely in Europe.\r\n\r\nThis exchange will create interlinked educational environment as the participants will share their personal impressions about peer eduaction, non-formal educational means, and we intend to evolve their knowledge and skills by integrating them into the society and thus raising their employability. The methods of non-formal education such as using facilitated discussion, developing positive relations and delivering projects will engage young people in the exchange. The actions and performances developed by youth, young leaders and peer educators during the exchange to publicise and promote minority youth inclusion and employability will help them and other youngsters recognize/multiply the value of such experience.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this exchange is that advantages gained and skills acquired will be used not only by participants of the project but also spread around local youth groups and the organizations that take part in such intercultural follow up projects will relate this to both a local and European context.\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ programme will be also explored and promoted which will lead to follow-up projects and usage of the skills gained during this exchange in them in terms of paying more attention to the topics of Dissemination and Transfer of Skills / Knowledge from the project.", "http://www.youngpeoplefirst.org.uk", "YOUNG PEOPLE FIRST (MIDLANDS)", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-036970_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CV31"}
