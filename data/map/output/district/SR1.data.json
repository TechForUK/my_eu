This is not always a smooth process; cultural differences can lead to social stresses and sometimes outright conflict. Thus education in cultural awareness and understanding has a very significant role. This is an educational domain in which attitudes and behaviours count much more than knowledge alone, and where developing empathy is a key pedagogical mechanism. Experiential approaches using role-play and case-studies have been shown to be highly effective, but can be difficult and expensive to organise. eCUTE will develop innovative technologically-enhanced learning approaches in cultural awareness and understanding that will help with these problems, based on virtual world simulations with intelligent interactive graphical characters embodying models of culturally-specific behaviour and interaction in scenarios developed via a user-centred design process. It will target two contrasting learner types-late primary-age children (9-11) and young adults (18-25) .We will: a) Develop pedagogical approaches to education in cultural understanding grounded in psychological and educational theory; b) Create believable cultural learning scenarios based on theoretical approaches that connect with the experiences of the target learner groups c) Establish an operational parameterisation of theoretically derived cultural behaviour and use it to create synthetic cultures and characters that behave as if they live within such cultures; d) Develop expressive behaviour for synthetic characters that is culturally appropriate; e)Create two cultural Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), one for late-primary children and the other for young adults based on virtual dramas using synthetic characters with culturally-specific interaction behaviour; f)Evaluate the created systems with stakeholder, teacher and learner groups, demonstrating their learning efficacy.", 320888.0, 2785958.0, "eCUTE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.sunderland.ac.uk/", null, "fp7_95590_998681834"], ["3SD", "Degradation or Empowerment?

Since its emergence into the public sphere as a \u201clegitimate\u201d (i.e. not illegal) cultural form during the 1970s, pornography has alternatively been regarded as demeaning and harmful or, on the contrary, as empowering and liberating for women \u2013 at a symbolic as well as material level. On one hand, feminist anti-porn campaigns \u2013 such as those led by C. MacKinnon and A. Dworkin during the 1980s \u2013 stated the existence of a destructive illocutory power of porn representations on women\u2019s life; on the other, feminist pro-porn theorists, as well as porn performers and directors have hailed the appearance of pornography within more public space as a means to the accomplishment of women\u2019s sexual consciousness and freedom. These two positions share an essentialist approach to pornography, which is often considered as devoid of generic/stylistic specificities or historical/geographical developments, as well as a similar attitude towards the audience, whose capability to engage in \u201cactive reading\u201d practices is nearly underestimated. My research project intends to test the taken-for-granted concepts of degradation and empowerment and their place in discussions of women in contemporary pornography. First of all, I will investigate the discursive strategies through which pornographic texts are organized and attempt to produce meaning, in order to better define women\u2019s representational status within pornography. Then, I will focus on audiences, trying to understand how different types of spectators engage with and reprocess diverse pornographic materials. Lastly, I will analyse the ways in which women have made their work careers within commercial pornography.

Yet, these systems still lack the personal, empathic and human elements that characterise a traditional teacher and fail to engage and motivate students in the same way a human teacher does. The EMOTE project will design, develop and evaluate a new generation of artificial embodied tutors that have perceptive capabilities to engage in empathic interactions with learners in a shared physical space. Overall, the EMOTE project aims to (1) research the role of pedagogical and empathic interventions in the process of engaging the learner and facilitating their learning progress and (2) explore if and how the exchange of socio-emotional cues with an embodied tutor in a shared physical space can create a sense of connection and social bonding and act as a facilitator of the learning experience. This will be done across different embodiments (both virtual and robotic), allowing for the effect that such embodiment will have on engagement and empathy to be explored. Further, the project will support the migration of the artificial tutors across different embodiments, to support students' learning in both formal and informal settings. To ground the research in a concrete classroom scenario, the EMOTE project will develop a showcase in the area of geography, focusing on environmental issues. This will enable tutors to be tested in real world school environments in different European countries.

The development of H2 technologies involve small-scale applications as well as large-scale infrastructures that are influenced by the acceptance of the public, stakeholders, communities and potential customers / users. Previous research on social acceptance investigated the general levels of public understanding of HFC technologies in specific countries, but there is limited systematic evidence on the acceptance of FCH technologies throughout Europe. The overall purpose of HYACINTH is to gain deeper understanding of social acceptance of H2 technologies across Europe and to develop a communication / management toolbox for ongoing or future activities introducing H2 into mobility, stationary and power supply systems.\nSocial acceptance of FCH technologies will be investigated via survey research with representative panels (7.000 European citizens) and semistructured interviews with 455 stakeholders in 10 countries. The design of the data gathering instruments will build upon methodological and conceptual developments in the research of new technologies social acceptance. The toolbox will provide the necessary information and understanding of the state of awareness and acceptance of HFC technologies by the public and by stakeholders.

In LeaD4Value these problems are addressed through lean maintenance data management to realise increased business value. Contrary to the Big Data hype, the idea here is to focus on the data decision support tools to be constructed based on analytical modelling and statistical analyses. Data will be collected from computerized maintenance management systems and enterprise resource planning systems of the two seconded companies, as well as from some of their employees via surveys and interviews. The results include e.g. a map of data exploitation paths, a process model, and a performance measurement system for lean maintenance data management. These tools can be used to reveal unnecessary maintenance tasks and data collection, missing data collection, or potential to increase the business value of maintenance. The role of world-class maintenance is highlighted in European manufacturing, because a majority of new production-related investments are directed to other continents. The proposed work is multidisciplinary by nature, combining aspects of business value management, reliability and maintenance engineering, and data sciences. The multidisciplinary view is needed, for asset management is challenged by maintenance engineers and managers understanding the technical aspects of maintenance but being unable to communicate these to the company decision makers in terms of business value.
