As part of the boreholing process, remediation chemicals will be introduced in to the ground contained within a geotextile sock. Diffusion of the chemicals (oxygen release compounds, hydrogen release compounds, zero-valent iron or chemical oxidants) occurs through the permeable geotextile material. Injection target cycle time will be = 5 mins from hole to hole at 1m spacing. The spacing of these boreholes will be decided by the concentration of contaminant and the required rate of clean-up. This whole system will be passive, i.e. requiring no energy to function after installation or operator maintenance. A range of equipment options are envisaged, from simple attachments for existing excavation plant \ufffd which will be the primary focus of HEISTT , enabling rapid take up of the process by SMEs due to the affordability of retrofit - through to dedicated bespoke machinery.", 250302.0, 1586316.0, "HEISTT", null, null, null, null, "http://www.dcpuk.com", null, "fp7_96169_991607624"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["5LP", "The snowball", "Milton Keynes College", 5739.0, "The youth council of the national youth association of Iceland  has been given a grant to carry out a nation wide project called \"Snj\u00f3boltinn\", a project that requires experience in project management, knowledge of sports to be used in education and how to empower young people with fewer opportunities in our work. With local knowledge already in grasp it seemed to be the natural step to take action in getting experience from abroad, something for which Erasmus+ with the youth exchange program offers a fantastic opportunity to do.\r\nThe objective of the project is for two partner countries to work on a youth exchange project in order to share experience and knowledge of relevant topics. With different cultural values and organisational backgrounds the youth council feels that the gains of youth exchanges in this field provides extremely valuable grounds for partnership, not only this one time but also for future cooperation.\r\nThe number of participants would be twenty, ten from each country, each with a background in youth leadership. The idea is that participants meet on an equal level and bring with them the knowledge and experience each side has to offer. This would not only enrich both parties' value but also provide valuable insight into the works of peers thousands of kilometers apart.\r\nThe activities planned will be aimed around project management and educational sports. To achieve this both partner countries will have used their resources of professionals in order to maintain a good and efficient program that both parties can benefit from.\r\nThe methodology and general philosophy will be around the idea of youth participation, youth empowerment and the inclusion of youth in decision making when it comes to projects that directly involves them.\r\nSince the goal of the project is especially aimed at project management and educational sports the desired impact is that through gained experience the project participants should be able to widen the pool of opportunities available to youth on all levels of their participation, be it local, national or international, mainly by being able to better organize their own projects. For long term results the advantages of networking are hard to argue with, especially in an increasingly globalized world.", "http://www.mkcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-IS02-KA105-001527_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "MK6"}
