The idea is to involve them consistently in the business\u2019s activities, including their dealing with tasks on their own.

Moreover, Business Studies topics relevant to their apprenticeships, such as Marketing, will be taught. A significant focus will always be on bringing to mind cross-cultural differences.\r\n\r\nTwo weekends of their visit will see the participants engage in cultural programmes planned and organised by them ahead of their stay in England.

The ICT coordinator will be in charge of teaching once she is back in our school and she will also be in charge of making sure the knowledge learned and the experiences acquired at  the center, are taught and implemented in different ways. The ICT Plan in our school will provide  our staff with different  training sessions to make sure that the knowledge reaches the rest of our teaching staff.

MAIN GOAL:The main objective would be to improve our teaching practice focusing on two issues:1. The use of ICT in the teaching-learning process, including  iPads or similar devices.2. Cooperative Learning.Guilford School has iPads as an everyday  tool in the classroom. Thanks to this advanced device, students access at all times to lots of educational contents, they can search different resources on the Internet, using tools that enhance their knowledge and creativity. The access to these tools allows students to prepare class assignments, analyze and solve problems more easily, being in charge of their own learning process. The use of these devices offers and individualization of the teaching-learning process.METHODOLOGY used to carry out the project:We believe that we must look at other educational experiences for a later implementation in our own school. This will allow us:- to promote the development of digital competence, with particular emphasis on the competence of learning to learn.- to observe how different European centers work with cooperative methodology and how do they integrate ICT tools in a cooperative way in order to take into account the diversity found in our classrooms.- to implement  inclusive dynamics through ICT .RESULTS, IMPACT and long-term benefits:The education and the observation that members of our staff will receive thanks to this project will allow us to continue implementing cooperative learning and teaching with iPads in our center.
