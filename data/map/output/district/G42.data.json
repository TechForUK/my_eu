We are a co-located unit within the host mainstream, Toryglen Primary School, with specialist provision for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Currently, the only opportunity for modern language learning in our establishment is through inclusion within the mainstream host school. Because of our pupils' difficulties with social communication and interaction, it is not possible for all of them to access the modern languages curriculum within the mainstream setting. Currently, one member of our staff is undergoing Spanish training through the Modern Languages in the Primary School (MLPS) programme. By attending a week-long immersion course in Spain, this member of staff will consolidate learning from the MLPS course while improving competence and confidence to teach the Spanish language. Our delegate will also improve methodological expertise in the teaching of Spanish and develop cultural awareness and understanding of contemporary Spain. The course will also provide materials and ideas suitable for teaching Spanish at the primary level including the use of ICT. The course will also provide an opportunity for our delegate to network, share good practice and develop projects with primary colleagues. \r\nOn return, our staff member will be more linguistically confident and culturally aware allowing us to develop and deliver a modern languages policy and curriculum suitable for the needs of our pupils. Initially, this staff member will be responsible for the planning and delivery of the modern languages curriculum and will implement a programme of work for Primary 5-7. Following on from this, training will be delivered to other members of staff which will allow us to work collegiately to develop the Primary 1-7 modern languages curriculum appropriate to the needs of our pupils. This project will allow us to forge stronger links with our host mainstream school and through staff training and development, this opens the possibility of each establishment now being able to offer two modern languages to their pupils. \r\nIt is envisaged that the modern languages curriculum will be embedded in our school improvement plan and that our school will make links with other establishments locally, nationally and internationally through eTwinning. By participating in this project, it is hoped we will develop international partnerships that could result in a legacy of European mobility for staff and pupils.", null, "Toryglen Language and Communication Resource", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002180_coordinator"], ["0LA", "Skills for Growth", "Urban Roots Initiative", 5381.0, "This project will see 2 organisations with similar aims and ethos working together on an exciting community education project.

These VET staff are employed on a full-time basis at a variety of levels, from schools football to elite coaching. Mobility will enhance personal skills via exposure to innovative EU coaching skills & expertise in Greece (6 places) and Holland (10 places)\r\n2. Coaching staff enrolled on the UEFA Pro Licence CPD course, the highest level of UK coaching certification. The participants enrolled on this UEFA programme with the Scottish FA generally have aspirations towards coaching at first team level at the highest echelons in the game. This group will comprise both male and female participants and will involve mobility to Czech Republic (25 places).\r\n3. Coaches involved in women\u2019s football or who are actively involved in the promotion of female participation in Scottish football will travel to Denmark (5 places), Spain (5 places) or Portugal  (5 places). \r\n4. Coaches affiliated to the six Scottish FA Regional Centres. This group will comprise  community coaches employed by the Scottish FA and/or Local Councils who are working at a community and grassroots level. Mobility will include partners Portugal (15 places), Spain (7 places), Denmark (7 places) and Belgium (12 places).\r\n\r\nThe Scottish FA has firmly embedded European mobility at the centre of it\u2019s coach education programmes and the participant coaches will bring back European methodologies and new training techniques which will be cascaded through their own employer organisation and also through the Scottish FA's extensive club, regional, community and grassroots networks. \r\n\r\nThe specific project objectives are summarised below:\r\n1. To provide participants with the opportunity to acquire the skills involved in the theory, practice and delivery of the most advanced coaching technologies and processes available in Europe.\r\n2. To enhance the national skills base among our VET staff who are involved in the delivery of football coaching to professional, community and grassroots clubs.\r\n3. To reduce unemployment rates and enhance employability of participants through the acquisition of additional skills and qualifications as a direct result of undertaking European mobility.\r\n4. To improve career progression for mobility participants as a direct result of the innovative skills and competences acquired during the mobility.\r\n5. To monitor employment rates among mobility participants and compare the data with statistics obtained from coaching personnel who have not participated in European mobility.\r\n6. To improve the skills and knowledge base among coaches in Women\u2019s football and increase participation to levels comparable with European countries.\r\n\r\nAll of the host partners have an established track record of excellence in relation to hosting and integrating participants within the work place. The seven receiving partners have all been selected on the basis of them being internationally recognised Centres of Excellence in their own particular area of expertise and their natural fit with the project objectives.\r\n\r\nThis mobility project will forge stronger links between VET providers in Scotland and seven other European countries and will lead to a new way of strategic thinking for the participating mobility coaches on their return to Scotland, irrespective of whether they operate at the elite, community or grassroots level of the game. The innovative coaching skills and competences derived from the mobility experience will become apparent on the professional and personal levels where they will see that planned methodical research must replace chance development in their teaching as they strive to help build world class coaching programmes and elite player development pathways on a national basis.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish FA will allocate a sum equivalent to 10% of the total budget to fund dissemination before, during and after the mobility period.

Year 1, we would be looking into the history of our cities/countries; studying profiles of historical figures, diversity of population, migration, cultural celebrations and the story of our cities (coat of arms, mottos\u2026) In year 2, we would study influential architects\\artists of our countries, landmarks, architectural qualities of our most celebrated buildings and artists/Architects; looking at their method and features of their work.  In year 3, our common focus would be sustainability.  We will study one of the main river systems in our countries; the purpose they serve, past and present; ecology and diversity of wildlife.

This will also be used as valuable time to make our 3 year plan more detailed and clear and discuss methodologies involved.  Two members of staff from Sagrada Familia will then visit Scotland to shadow teachers and gain insight and ideas to take back to Catalonia.Year 2 , teachers will re-visit Sagrada Familia to meet with pupils and teachers to discuss the project so far.  We can address any successes and challenges and ensure the project is on task and methodology is effective.  We will also use this opportunity to shadow teach and build on some of the lessons previously taught throughout the year.

This current project will address key Eramus+ priorities by targeting and upskilling FAI Coach Educators who will make maximum benefit from inclusion on the mobility.

To introduce participants to the coaching qualifications ladder, providing them with a career path and a recognised beginners coaching qualification to keep them in the game and to offer them employability within sport for the future.

This mobility may very well be the first time a number of participants have travelled abroad and introducing them to good coaching practices within Europe would significantly enhance their learning experience.\r\n4. To broaden social development of participants through interaction by meeting new people. The mobility will improve personal development and social awareness for participants. Interpersonal skills will be developed through group discussion, debate and presentations.\r\n5.
