Molecular orientation and microstructural shape are often connected to the degree of the disease. Although polarisation can provide a wealth of relevant information, very few techniques have made it from the lab to the market.\nThe present fellowship is directed to the most exhaustive polarimetric technique, the complete Mueller polarimetry. This technique can analyse the polarization state of backscattered or transmitted light as a function of illuminating light polarization. The object-to-be-investigated microstructure can alter the polarization state in three possible ways: diattenuation, retardance and depolarization. Since 2007 the fellow has been developing a unique Snapshot Mueller polarimeter (SMP) which opens novel avenues in interrogating the polarisation properties. The fellowship aims at advancing the provision of complete Mueller matrix information in at least two technological directions: (i) building a Swept-Source SMP (3SMP) to increase the acquisition speed of the SMP by using recent advances in the field of optical coherence tomography, (ii) devising hand held 3SMP configurations by applying principles of coherence gating.

From the seminal paper of Ferguson  (1973, Annals of Statistics), the Dirichlet Process and its extensions have been increasingly used to address inferential problems in many fields. Examples range from variable selection in genetics to linguistics, psychology, human learning , image segmentation and applications to neurosciences. The increased interest in non-parametric Bayesian approaches to data analysis is motivated by a number of attractive inferential properties. For example, BNP priors are often used as flexible models to describe the heterogeneity of the population of interest, as they implicitly induce a clustering of the observations into homogeneous groups.\nIn the big data era, there is a growing need of models that can describe the main features of large and non-trivial datasets. The information held in these kind of datasets is increasingly easily available to collect through modern networks such as the Internet.

However, in the existing wireless cellular networks, all data traffic must go through base stations regardless of the location of the user equipment (UE), even if two UEs are very close. When UEs are at the edge of a cell, the transmit power must be large and the data rate is low. One way to overcome this problem and efficiently handle localised group communication is to enable direct communication between UEs, which is called device-to-device (D2D) communication. D2D as an underlay to cellular networks has been considered as an important component in future cellular systems.\nThis project, CODEC, focuses on resource management (RM) in cellular D2D communications, which is indispensable for achieving spectral and energy efficiency and providing QoS to different applications. Different from current researches, CODEC envisions that two use cases, direct D2D and D2D relay, should be considered in RM in D2D communications to support proximity-based applications including unicast, multicast and broadcast applications. In order to reflect different applications and use cases in RM for cellular D2D communications, as the first work item, the key novelty of CODEC is that a generic analytical framework will be proposed to analyse the performance of cellular D2D communications under both user cases with various proximity-based applications in a systematic way.

Currently, this subject is one of the most active in both mathematics and mathematical physics. One way to approach Poisson algebras is via quantisation. In this context, Poisson algebras are the semiclassical limits of noncommutative algebras. Naturally, this suggests that the underlying geometry of a Poisson algebra should be intimately connected to the noncommutative geometry of the corresponding 'quantum' noncommutative algebra; the noncommutative geometry of the 'quantum' spaces is closely related to the geometry of the space of symplectic leaves. The first main aim of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the link between Poisson algebras and their 'quantum counterparts', and then, of course, use it to derive some new results on Poisson and 'quantum' algebras. In the singular case, another way to attack (singular) Poisson algebras is to consider their resolutions of singularities. Roughly speaking, the idea is to attach to a singular Poisson algebra another Poisson algebra that is smooth and that keeps track, at least on the smooth part, of the Poisson structure of the original singular Poisson algebra. The second aim of this project is to study such resolutions; more precisely, we will study the relationship between symplectic singularities and their symplectic resolutions from the point-of-view of representation theory and combinatorics.'", 37523.0, 37523.0, "POISSONALGEBRAS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.kent.ac.uk", null, "fp7_88545_999841275"], ["7NZ", "The History of Human Freedom and Dignity in Western Civilization", "University of Kent", "The ETN has two aims: to a) train ESRs; b) investigate the The History of Human Freedom and Dignity in Western Civilization. \na) The ETN will establish an innovative training programme which allows the ESRs to obtain specialist knowledge of a specific research topic and to obtain transferable skills enabling the students to apply their knowledge in non-academic institutions, e.g. dealing with social welfare, human resources, or legal /political institutes.

By excellence, the Master/Slave OCT method delivers en-face views direct, allowing lower cost hardware and faster provision of en-face slicing and visualisation.

Trans-European organisations have identified the need for a common set of core modules  to inform professional development. Safeguarding presents challenges to all child support agencies where there are concerns regarding child welfare and these challenges require a co-ordinated response.\r\n \r\nObjectives\r\nThe project aims to create a suite of core child protection modules for social work child protection training in South East Europe.  The creation of complementary child protection training within partner institutions will provide a template for future transnational collaborations and improved cross border collaboration. Such a joint enterprise will enhance the quality and relevance of the learning in social work education and increase the capacity and professionalism of a skilled workforce to address the challenges of child protection and welfare in a globalised world via improved competency and knowledge base of social workers.\r\n \r\nThe identified modules include:\r\n- Practice / skills base / risk assessment (including online e-learning skills scenarios)   \r\n- Effective practice / evidence base / monitoring skills\r\n- Collaborative working / multi-agency approaches (including co-production with children and families)\r\n- Working with hard to reach children / families \r\n- Transnational social work (include issues of poverty and / or culture) \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe project group comprises eight universities with specialised areas of skill and expertise.

By creating a state of the art curriculum on (irregular) Border-Crossing, in which the tension between Security and Social Justice play a central role and in which migration-related social problems issues and transnational crimes are studied in that particular context, the Universities of Rotterdam (Erasmus) (NL), Ghent (BE), Kent (UK),  Bologna (IT) and Istanbul (Ko\u00e7) (TK) will make a significant contribution to the specific objective of the Erasmus + Programme, as outlined in the 2011 EU Modernisation Agenda, to foster quality improvements, innovation excellence and internationalisation at the level of education and training institutions, in particular through enhanced transnational cooperation between education, research and training providers and other stakeholders.For a long time, the EU has tried to build a common criminal justice area within its external borders, and the recent escalation of terrorism, coupled with the challenges of large scale migration, refugees and radicalisation have increased the recognition of the need for  joint international responses, in which security demands and social justice need to be balanced. It is evident that, in order to address these challenges, there is a need for highly trained personnel with an international, multi-cultural training and outlook. Personnel that is able to combine viewpoints from different disciplines, including the juridical, political and cultural-sociological disciplines. The problems dealt with in the ReMEIC programme and the solutions to these problems require a European or transnational approach. This transnational and interdisciplinary approach should be reflected in education. However, there are singular courses in global criminology at various universities, there are Master\u2019s programmes on various dimensions of it, but an overall programme in which all migration-related international crimes and their governance are connected does not yet exist. The proposed Research Master aims to fill this gap and aims to offer a broad range of expertise and research specialisms which are essential for a genuinely international programme.The partners involved in developing  the Research Master in European and International Criminology all have an ample, albeit different research and teaching expertise in the field of border-crossing, security and social justice. The main aim of the Strategic Partnership is bringing this expertise together and developing a balanced and innovative curriculum with a number of common activities and courses (mainly in the field of global criminology, research methods and transferable skills)and optional courses in order to provide the possibility to follow different tracks. In addition, ReMEIC will include innovative, interactive teaching methods, in which the strengths of both face-to-face student-lecturer contact, informal learning and social media are optimised.

In the face of this crisis, governments have largely not succeeded in finding pan-European solutions, relying instead on national approaches. This project will take a different approach by aiming to strengthen European cooperation in the field of adult learning to enhance inclusion of refugees at the level of civil society organisations. Successful inclusion of the high number of refugees into the European societies is an ongoing agenda that will demand commitment and solutions in the longer term. It is the premise of this project that sport and physical activity organisations in particular, as the biggest civil society sector in the world, can play an important role in providing learning opportunities and taking a holistic approach to successful inclusion of refugees into the European societies. When engaging in sport and physical activities, participants for instance acquire positive life skills, attitudes and values. Moreover, non-formal educational and training activities carried out by sports organisations further enhance leadership and organisational skills and can make important contributions to the learning, self-esteem and, ultimately, employability of the individual participants involved. OBJECTIVES AND OUTPUTSThe Inclusion of Refugees through Sport project has as its overall aim to strengthen the societal inclusion of refugees via the informal and non-formal learning opportunities sport and physical activities provide. The specific objectives areObjective 1: To build the knowledge base for informal and non-formal learning opportunities for societal inclusion of refugees via physical activities and sport Objective 2: To build capacities in participating organisations and develop tools to deliver informal and non-formal learning opportunities for the target groupObjective 3: To establish and run a broad thematic network of organisations working in the fieldObjective 4: To disseminate results and widen the impact of the projectObjective 5 (management objective): To ensure quality in the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the projectThe proposed project will deliver five specialised Intellectual Outputs: A Good Practices Collection with examples from the field (including key principles that are characteristics of a successful practice); A Grundtvig Video for refugees to learn lifelong principles of active participation in civic society activities; An online learning resource for staff and volunteers in grassroots sport organisations to learn about ways of integrating refugees through their activities; A supporting Toolkit; and A Networking Platform for these organisations to meet and collaborate. After the project has ended, the partner organisations will be able to use the results to train staff and volunteers in their own organisations and thus enhance their own capacities further.PARTICIPANTS AND TARGET GROUPThe International Sport and Culture Association (ISCA) will lead the coordination of the project, and the cross-sector partnership consortium includes the University of Kent and StreetGames (UK), SISU Idrottsutbildarna (Sweden), UISP (Italy), Ollerup Academy of Physical Education (Denmark) and Deutsche Turnerjugend (Germany). The direct target group of the project is the organisations and entities (and the individuals in them) that provide opportunities for engaging in grassroots sport and physical activity. At least 22 organisations will form a network by the end of the project and test the project\u2019s resources before they are disseminated.The ultimate target group of the project is refugees that have arrived in Europe. Since the handling and status of refugees, including their availability to engage in various civic actions differ a lot between the different European member states, the project will from the outset take an inclusive approach to defining the target group. As the project progresses, learnings are expected to emanate as to how various subsets of the ultimate target group can engage in the learning opportunities provided in the grassroots sport setting. It is expected that approximately 4900 refugees will be directly involved in the project\u2019s activities.IMPACTThe project aims to maximise the impact on the target group by increasing the capacity of the grassroots sport organisations that can reach out and provide informal and non-formal learning opportunities, with a starting point in the project consortium. By creating a platform for continued and expanded organisational collaboration on this emerging issue, the project will also impact further organisations and thus potentially impact the systemic level by showcasing and enabling the grassroots sport sector to deliver relevant, informal and non-formal learning opportunities for the inclusion of refugees to achieve wider societal benefits.", "http://www.kent.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DK01-KA204-022362_3"], ["7FG", "Popular University in Community Psychology: well being through art", "REAL GROUP (UK) LIMITED", 219879.0, "POPULART project,  using ART as a vehicle will offer unique pathways to adult education for active citizenship, personal development and fulfillment.

This will include the production of open access research and teaching material which can be easily integrated to the teaching of undergraduate and graduate students world-wide and which will contribute to the professional development of early-career academic professionals and a strengthening of EU studies in this field.The network will first directly impact on strengthening EU studies in the specific sub-fields of political science and international relations. The broad international dissemination of guest lectures, construction and distribution of regularly updated specialist reading lists, syllabus teaching units, a teaching handbook on EU Crisis Simulation gaming, and \u2018how-to\u2019 guides to teaching innovation will all serve to improve access and raise the profile of teaching EU foreign policy Second, the network will assist in the development of early career scholars, offering unique added value through  opportunities for professional networking, the research buddy system, high profile outlets for working papers, blog posts, book reviews and participation in several research publication proposals. All of this will be showcased on the dedicated web platform of http://www.eufp.eu and via the leading European-based academic association for EU-studies (UACES).  Third, this network offers direct added value to 100s of graduate and undergraduate students at the participating institutions. In terms of pod casted lectures, annual paper awards and engagement in the proposed EU Crisis Simulation game, students will profit from the collective research and teaching efforts of experienced leading scholars in the field, the enthusiasm and innovation of early career scholars and the contribution of educational technologists and learning specialists.", "http://www.kent.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_553172-EPP-1-2014-1-IE-EPPJMO-NETWORK_6"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 123204.0, "Strengthening frontier research in the European Research Council (08.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_15545", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 1593537.0, "Strengthening frontier research in the European Research Council (08.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_17145", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 102889.0, "Erasmus+ \u2014 Contribution from the development cooperation instrument (DCI) (21.02.20)", "fts_2017_24889", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 62802.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_28358", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 10646.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_36006", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 170486.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_40850", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 65114.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_52789", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 65114.0, "Strengthening frontier research in the European Research Council (08.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_52790", 2017], ["7NZ", "UNIVERSITY OF KENT ROYAL CHARTER*UNIKENT", 2406.0, "Developing the European dimension in sport (15.02.03)", "fts_2017_53485", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT2"}
