At present FIR observations lie in a resolution gap of 2 orders of magnitude represented by the James-Webb Space telescope in the mid-infrared on one side and the ALMA interferometer, in the sub-mm, on the other. Only with the development of space borne interferometers can we hope to bridge this divide.\nThis project brings together the leading international experts on FIR space instrumentation and experienced astronomers in a unique collaborative effort to address the development needs of a high resolution FIR observatory through two major activities. Firstly to identify the scientific questions which require high spatial resolution observations in the FIR.  We will translate these into the definition of an ambitious space mission and its associated key technologies.\nAt the same time we will study a number of technologies relevant to space interferometers which are at a low Technology Readiness Level. These include free-space beam combination with cryogenic delay lines, deployable low-mass telescopes, accurate satellite position measurement techniques and advanced ground calibration scenarios. We will develop these technologies through a consortium of universities, research establishments and industry which combine the best academic and industrial expertise.\nThe outcome of this work will advance the knowledge and technology required for a future FIR mission, consolidate the scientific community and bring world-wide expertise to the EU consortium. We will promote the results to a wider scientific community through a number of international workshops centred on the definition of a future FIR space mission.", 57240.0, 2060899.0, "FISICA", "Interferometric observations from space", "An EU-funded project has brought together international experts to review the science case for a European-led far infrared (FIR) interferometer based on recent results of the Herschel and Planck space missions.", "The FIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum \u2014 extending from roughly 30 to 300\u00a0micrometres \u2014 offers a unique window on astrophysical processes that are obscured at other wavelengths by cosmic dust. These include the formation of stars and planetary systems, as well as massive black holes as they glow at the centre of active galaxies.\n\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) Herschel and Planckmissions have made a huge contribution to our knowledge of this invisible Universe. But these space-borne telescopes suffer from the fact that their ability to see details of distant objects is determined by their size. Moreover, laboratory testbeds devoted to the development of new FIR interferometers have largely stopped work due to lack of funding.\n\nWith financial support of the EU, the http://www.fp7-fisica.eu/ (FISICA) project has brought together experts on space FIR instrumentation with leading astronomers. Engineers and scientists joined their efforts to identify still-open scientific questions that a Far-Infrared Space Interferometer could help understand, therefore addressing the current lack of observational capability in the FIR and complementing the many findings of the Herschel and Planck missions, as well as of the ground-based Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to improve our understanding of the Universe, near and far.\n\nTo address questions that require high spatial resolution observations in the FIR, the optimum instrument design is currently being defined. The FISICA partners' goal is to ultimately outline the design and model the performance of a space-borne FIR interferometer that combines the necessary angular resolution with high sensitivity and wide spectral coverage. Critical technology developments needed to make a realistic proposal are, therefore, identified.\n\nA computer model of the chosen conceptual design has been created to predict the observational performance of the FIR interferometer in different scenarios. On the other hand, the technological readiness level of key optical components required for the FIR interferometer design is advanced in a dedicated experimental development programme.\n\nDetection of extremely weak FIR signals demands ultra-sensitive detectors and instruments capable of operating at maximum efficiency.

One of the central ideas underlying European Lifelong Learning policies is that international mobility should become a natural part of education and training schemes. This helps learners to achieve higher qualification levels which are crucial for a successful first step into the labour market or for career improvements. The EU Member States are fully committed to helping young people take advantage of the opportunities open to them in terms of learning mobility. Young people participating in VET schemes are a particular focus of this commitment, and the Member States recently set a target of enabling 6% of all learners in initial VET to have completed a period of VET study abroad by 2020. \r\n\r\nIn line with these objectives and European policies, through GREEEN II, I.I.S (Institute of Higher Education) MERLONI MILIANI of Fabriano aims to improve the quality of education and vocational training, giving a European dimension to the learning paths and thus providing the young participants the opportunity to test and improve their skills: professionalism in the specific areas of vocational education (renewable energy and environment), cultural knowledge and linguistic preparation. This general objective is pursued through a mobility experience that consists of a learning mobility internship abroad of 3 weeks for 80 students of fourth year of technical and vocational secondary school with fields of study related to the renewable energy and other 8 newly graduated.\r\nThe training programme includes an internship in selected companies in the renewable energy and environment to acquire knowledge and skills within the sectors and activities aimed at the inclusion and integration in the context and for the improvement of language skills and to better know the culture of the hosting country. The main expected results from the project include: the rise of the personal and professional skills of the participants, and the promotion of key competencies related to the real exercise of active citizenship; increasing the employment potential of the participants, the introduction of innovative training methods as a complement to existing practices and pathways and the improvement of the educational level of technical and vocational schools, the development of relations between the transnational partners and the promotion of processes of cooperation and exchange of good practices between the partners involved, with a significant impact in improving the educational and vocational guidance.\r\n\r\nThe project is, besides, implemented in an European context considering the European priority and thematic such as \"ECVET for transparency and recognition of learning outcomes and qualifications\".

It is a global business and global labour market. There is fierce competition, not only domestically, but internationally as well. In England in 2013-14 the top eight Premier League clubs made 44 new signings and 33 of these players were foreign. Staggeringly in 2013-14 just five English players took part in all 38 Premier League matches. Currently, 93% of players at English academies are British but less than 25% of new players signed by Premier League clubs in 2013-14 were UK nationals. Clearly, our academy players are not making the transition to first team status as efficiently as our European competitors, which supports the Welsh FA\u2019s desire to study European coaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA\u2019s previous participation in the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme has demonstrated the undoubted potential for mobility to enhance the employment prospects for young apprentices (VET learners). Between 15-20% of all mobility participants went on to achieve first team status, which is an unprecedented success rate and directly attributable to the benefits of mobility. By contrast, in the absence of mobility, only 5-8% of apprentices can expect to achieve first team promotion.  One of the great value-added benefits of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are still four times more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. \r\n\r\nMobility will allow 65 male and female elite players to experience the training methods at three UEFA-acknowledged centres of excellence in Austria, Spain and Portugal.
