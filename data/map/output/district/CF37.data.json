The European Commission estimates there will be 700, 000 unfilled vacancies for ICT practitioners in the EU by the year 2016. Of all job vacancies in ICT, computer programmers are the most in demand outnumbering the demand for other IT professionals by a factor of 5 to 1.  The greatest demand is in UK, Germany, Estonia and other Northern European countries, which reflects the make up of the project partnership. \r\n\r\nDespite this skills shortage, there has been limited response from the European education system.  Estonia has already introduced computer programming for all ages across the school curriculum, Denmark partially so.  Others are about to introduce it (such as England in 2014) and others are considering it (e.g Finland, Ireland).  Some German L\u00e4nder such as Bavaria are well advanced; others are not.  In other countries, whilst not part of the compulsory curriculum, there are agencies and individual teachers who are trying to introduce programming into the classroom.  What seems inevitable is that all member states must surely move in this direction if they are to meet the skills demands of the European economy.  The biggest problem we face is a desperate shortage of teachers. Mathematics and computer-science graduates generally choose more lucrative trades; the humanities and social-science graduates who will find themselves teaching coding will need plenty of support as will the primary teachers. \r\n\r\nIn addition the OECD reports that more and more computer programmers prefer to be self-employed or working in micro-SME partnerships and not committed to one particular long-term employer and the vacancy market is beginning to reflect the increase in a new form of employment in the ICT sector. For this reason the project is looking to produce resources for developing entrepreneurship skills alongside programming skills.\r\n\r\nThe project will:\r\nDevelop a website of activities and ideas that teachers can use in the classroom to teach children about coding and programming.  These will support diverse curricula across member states and, where there is no formal curriculum, support individual schools and teachers who want to introduce computing / informatics / programming etc in their own practice.\r\nDevelop some affordable resource kits that can be downloaded or for which instructions for making them can be provided on-line.  This could result in selling the resource kits after the project as part of the exploitation and sustainability.\r\nDesign and pilot some staff development opportunities and learning resources for teachers who are total newcomers to programming.\r\nStimulate a positive attitute towards STEM with young children\r\nTest and evaluate existing resources such as the range of software currently available to help children develop programming skills.\r\nExplore and follow up existing research and projects addressing this issue (e.g work on Tangible User Interface for children.)\r\nEnter into policy dialogue and inform policy in countries around issues concerning the teaching and learning of programming in schools", "http://www.pontydysgu.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-BE02-KA201-012307_8"], ["4DY", "Strategies, Models and Tools for Continuing Professional Development for Teachers in e-Learning", "PONTYDYSGU LIMITED", 274541.0, "Virtually all member state countries are promoting the use of digital technologies for learning across the curriculum.  Some member states are also changing (or have changed) their existing ICT curriculum to include coding and computational thinking throughout compulsory schooling.  Others are introducing new, overarching digital competence frameworks  that incorporate both.   This is creating a major problem for those responsible for training teachers, in particular creating opportunities for continuing professional development  for existing staff.  According to the survey, funded by the European Commission Directorate General Information Society and Media,  only 40% of pupils in member states are taught by teachers who have engaged in any pedagogical training on the use of ICT.    Moreover, it is not just the teachers that need training - there are also teaching assistants, technicians, managers and support staff.  According to Eurostat (2016) there is a total of 2 million primary teachers and 2.5 million secondary teachers in the 28 EU countries.    The OECD\u2019s Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Teachers\u2019 Professional Development in Europe (2014) estimates that at that date there were still 2 million teachers who had received little or no training in using and teaching digital technologies.\r\n\r\nTo cope with this unprecedented level of demand, the training of teachers needs to get smarter and more efficient\r\n\r\nProject Objectives\r\n1) to  support those education professionals who are responsible for developing and implementing strategies for integrating digital technologies  into the curriculum at all educational levels by providing them with a critical analysis of different strategic approaches together with tools to measure progression and quality\r\n2) to improve the effectiveness of teacher trainers and other professionals delivering staff development in using digital technologies for learning by providing a comprehensive Trainers Handbook detailing and evaluating different modes and models of delivery and including guidelines for their implementation, examples of good practice, case studies etc\r\n3) to improve the efficiency of teacher trainers by developing a trainers tool kit of materials and resources, programme outlines, content, activity ideas\r\n4) to determine whether the Intellectual outcomes of the project are transferable to other education sectors, specifically VET and Adult Education and to make recommendations and amendments if relevant \r\n5) to establish and facilitate a community of practice for those involved in helping teachers to deliver the new digital competences and helping them to integrate the use of technologies for learning in their classroom.   \r\n\r\nThe target groups who will benefit directly are staff development professionals, teacher trainers, institutional managers and those responsible for strategy at regional or consortia level.

Formally and informally acquired skills and competencies are visualized using a specific type of portfolio developed in the project. Within the framework of the project, both the web-based competence multimedia environment and the consultancy of young people will be developed in the form of an accompanying course offered in the countries. Within the framework of the project, a consultancy concept with a specific scope of courses offered for the generation and reflection of appropriate media formats (e.g. video clips of work processes at the company providing internship, interviews with trainees and skilled workers of a branch, image data of own work-pieces and projects etc.) is to be developed, tested and evaluated. \r\n\r\nThe research design is based on several distinct research strategies:\r\n\r\n1. A desk study (analysis, literature review) of the situation of vocational preparation organised and embedded in the VET system and the employment situation of young people in the countries.

The didactic approach of the course design is based on constructivist pedagogy and constructionist media education, combining active design and reflection processes of the young participants. The project will focus on learning processes for the conception and production of authentic media products for vocational self-presentation and the presentation of one\u2019s skills. These media products are to present the young people in the context of their professional activities (e.g. during internships that are combined with the setup of visual material). In addition, the young people are to be given a feedback regarding their strengths and weaknesses and the way in which they can present their competences in an effective manner.\r\n\r\nThe didactic approach of the online multimedia environment is based on the idea of shaping technology by the users themselves.

(Saulnier, Landry, Herbert in Wagner, 2008) have been developing student-centred learning. Within this approach teachers mainly focus upon what students should learn and emphasize why (Bransford, Vye & Bateman, 2002), they take into account the already existing knowledge of students (Bransford, Brown, Cocking, 2000; Protheroe, 2007), provide different opportunities for students to learn, often change teaching methods, help students who have troubles and consider their background. Teachers discuss with students which study activities lead to good results, expose students to looking for alternatives and trying to find their own solutions. Examination questions refer to real situation and do not lead to categorizing students with regard to their marks. Aslan in Reigeluth (2013) state that modern educational systems should address the needs of the contemporary students, facilitate the study process and prepare students for social life. Each educational system should look at each individual student as a student with special needs and should not require that all students learn in the same way. \r\n\r\nThis project intends to make a research of the student-centred and personalized approach in several European countries, prepare a handbook of good practices for teachers and thus contribute to the modernisation of  Europe\u2019s higher education systems, to a reduction in the number of low-skilled adults who study at universities, revise and strengthen the professional capacities of teachers and improve the attainment of young people and the organizational culture of universities.\r\n\r\nThere are four participants from four European countries, three HEIs and one research and development SME specialized in development and support of programmes and courses for teachers and trainers. \r\n\r\nThe main activities of the project are a large-scale research on the theory and practice of the student-centred learning, a teachers' handbook on good practices from student-centred learning, three scientific articles, dissemination of results and a short follow-up study.\r\n\r\nThe project methodology includes a large-scale research (survey of literature, questionnaires to teachers, data analysis, guidelines, conclusions) and uses the research methods of the social sciences.

Under-representation and under-utilisation of women in entrepreneurship.  \r\nWhile increasing numbers of women are becoming involved in entrepreneurship and make vital contributions to economies, in most contexts globally fewer women than men start and run new businesses; fewer still run mature businesses, indicating issues with long term sustainability (Kelley et al, 2013).  Despite being contested, under-performance hypotheses, positioning female owned businesses as less successful than male owned, are perpetuated (McAdam, 2013) and distort policy, business support and education/training interventions in ways that are unhelpful.\r\n2. Entrepreneurship education is still a relatively new field; little attention has been paid to gendered perspectives (Ettl and Welter, 2010).  \r\nThere is over-reliance on inappropriate, traditional teaching methods and content more suited studying large organisations than preparation for future entrepreneurs and the start up and development of entrepreneurial organisations (Williams Middleton and Donnellon, 2014; Mwasalwiba, 2010). Recent research into enterprise and entrepreneurship education offered within European HEIs reveals an unconscious masculine bias in promotion, pedagogy and content (Jones and Warhuus, 2014; Jones, 2011). This may explain the lack of take up by female students of (optional) generic enterprise and entrepreneurship focused modules/courses and may contribute to a vicious circle which perpetuates negative stereotyping and alienates women from considering entrepreneurial careers.        \r\nObjectives are to develop an industry endorsed, validated, joint Masters in Gender and Entrepreneurship.   Through the project activities, additional objectives will be to contribute to promoting and encouraging entrepreneurship as a viable career option for women and girls and to contribute to developing knowledge and good practice in gender and entrepreneurship research and in women\u2019s entrepreneurship education in Higher Education Institutions.\r\nThe project aims to engage with 222 participants.  In addition to generic barriers to start up and growth that may be encountered by any business, women may also encounter gender specific barriers including less social, human, financial, symbolic and entrepreneurial capital (McAdam, 2013); lack of confidence and lack of self efficacy may be of key significance (Kirkwood, 2009) together with greater degrees of difficulty in reconciling home or personal priorities with those of business..\r\nAn action research framework will underpin the project so that greater insights and more specific knowledge and understanding will be accumulated as the project progresses.  This will result in the project activities increasing in quality and relevance.\r\nReflecting the importance in gender and entrepreneurship of context upon opportunities and constraints, the consortium partners (Wales/UK, France and Greece) represent different socio-political economic contexts. The project design features individual and group interviews in each of the partner countries and transnational intensive programmes enable the learning and teaching approach, content and materials to be trialled with women from different contexts within Europe.\r\nThrough the transnational intensive programmes and dissemination activities, 71 women will gain increased entrepreneurial capital, confidence and self efficacy; entrepreneurial knowledge and skills development and increased awareness of strategies to overcome gender specific challenges to entrepreneurship.  Through dissemination activities, 27 researchers, teachers, trainers, lecturers and 26 policy makers and business support professionals will have greater knowledge and understanding of strategies for Integrating  best practice in the delivery of gender aware and gender sensitive entrepreneurship education, related policy and business support.\r\nRegarding challenge 1, the project will promote entrepreneurship as a relevant career choice for women. The research, development and dissemination activities will raise awareness of limiting stereotypes and their negative implications at an individual level for female entrepreneurs and at an institutional level (policy, higher education) for female entrepreneurship.  Alternative, gender sensitive models will be identified and promoted.\r\nRegarding challenge 2, new, gender sensitive approaches to course promotion, teaching and learning methods and content will be developed, piloted and disseminated widely. The course will equip individual female entrepreneurs with strategies to help them overcome gender specific barriers to entrepreneurial careers.

W. 2011. ABC's of Action Learning. Burlington, VT: Gower) all the participants will co-create and develop a Matrix for spiritual care education and associated adoption toolkit derived from their own experiences. The newly developed Matrix will guide improvements in the way spiritual aspects of nursing care are integrated and taught within nursing curricula.  These developments will initially be undertaken locally in participating organisations with a view to expansion into other HEI in the future. EPICC will provide a sustainable network so that ongoing curriculum development in spiritual care can be supported, monitored and evaluated.Results Envisaged impact and Potential long term benefitsThe project will develop the knowledge, skills and expertise of nurse educators by providing them with a standard for continuing professional development thereby adding to the skills of local and European labour market, and meeting the labour market needs of an active and aging population.All outputs from EPICC will be submitted to participating countries professional regulatory bodies to inform the ongoing development of policy and practice guidance. This will ensure that nursing students receive adequate preparation in the provision of spiritual care.EPICC will enhance the quality and skills set of student nurses in participating institutions by ensuring they have the right professional values, attitudes and behaviours to provide high quality and safe nursing care.  In the long term EPICC will contribute towards ensuring a consistent approach to learning and teaching about spiritual aspects of care.These approaches will be based upon sound evidence and educational theory.

Making the Case for Lifelong Learning", "PONTYDYSGU LIMITED", 104400.0, "As defined by Ellen MacArthur Foundation, as the name suggests, a \u2018circular economy\u2019 is a feedback-rich approach, (often described as \u2018circularity\u2019) with its subject matter the choices we make around resources \u2013 the economy. It rests in contradistinction to a linear economy. A circular economy uses insights into real world systems which are complex, adaptive systems. These systems are open to modelling and influence where we emphasise participation, connections and understanding consequences rather than the identification of parts and their manipulation.\r\n\r\nA maturing circular economy will face three big challenges, as Walter Stahel (architect and industrial analys) frames it. The challenge of \u2018Re-\u2018 that is the challenge to perfect re-using, re-manufacturing, re-designing and all the other \u2018re-\u2018 actions that need to occur to keep resources at their highest value for the longest possible time. Secondly follows the challenge of \u2018De\u2019, when products can no longer be re-cycled in a value-adding way: \u2018de-constructing\u2019, \u2018disassembling\u2019, \u2018de-taching\u2019. The third challenge comes with a capital K \u2013 Knowledge. Education about the circular economy framework and the crucial knowledge for it, such as technical and economic understanding, as well as \u2018materials-literacy\u2019, needs to permeate every level of society, not just c-suites and experts. As stressed and highlighted during the discussion taken at the \u201cCircular Economy Stakeholder Conference\u201d (9-10 March, 2017) in Brussels, every worker, consumer and so, adult should be equipped with such knowledge, thus, education stands as one of the building blogs of a circular economy, including awareness raising in general public and business community and integration of circular concepts at all levels of education, starting from the lifelong learning approach. Thus, CYCLE projects stands for a shift to the circular economy by supporting integration of circular economy into adult education curriculum and outreach programs to increase awareness in the general public and so, contributing to the construction of knowledge society based on human capital development. \r\n\r\n\"Education in all its forms at all levels will form an essential part of the transition to a circular economy. This must include the identification of the training needs of workers who needs to be part of inmediate change as well as the longer term action of educating future generations\" - as highlighted in the EESC \"Communication from the Comission to the  European Parliament\" on Circular Economy. Education needs to extend to all levels from primary schools to companies, SMEs, investors and financiers, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to Jean Pierre Maugendre, there are some additional key trends to be considered when analyzing the effects of a circular economy on employment and the labour force. These trends are expected to profoundly shape the future of businesses, as well as the skills requirements for employees. Life-long learning is of major importance, however the process of life-long learning has not yet been effectively integrated. By improving the skills of adult trainers, and thus, supporting the introduction of Circular Economy competences in lifelong learning, CYCLE project is intended not only to fill in the idenfied gap (improving the learning pathway of adult education professionals), but also contributing to the transition agenda. \r\n\r\nThe project will start in October 2017 and it will finish in September 2019. CYCLE partnership is formed by six organisations coming from six different European countries: Spain, Austria, Italy, Poland, Belgium and United Kingdom, representing different approaches on learning methodologies, adult education and competences development.\r\n\r\nDuring project implementation, two main Intellectual Output will be elaborated:\r\nIntellectual output 1: Pedagogical Model for Circular Economy Competences Development and Training\r\nIntellectual output 2: CYCLE Competence Centre", "http://www.pontydysgu.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-ES01-KA204-038470_3"], ["4DY", "Young Entrepreneurs Teaching Initiative for Young Entrepreneurs", "PONTYDYSGU LIMITED", 249967.0, "The project promotes the idea of self employment to young people as a viable route to employment and creates learning opportunities that enable them to explore this option further. For those that want to progress, it provides a new approach and a new pedagogy for entrepreneurship training using teams of Young Ambassadors, 20 in total in the pilot, who are themselves successful young entrepreneurs to act as role models, deliver workshops and peer support through a young entrepreneur network.\r\n\r\nThe project outputs include all the materials and resources that other organisations need to replicate the model which are stored on a content rich website together with a training video. The materials include a Training the Trainer pack for training the Young Ambassadors in workshop design, presentation skills, coaching and mentoring skills as well as an innovative curriculum and and methodology for entrepreneurship education.  There are a set of detailed entrepreneurship training modules complete with indicative content, trainer notes and a menu of activities. This is supported by a large databank of web based multimedia materials so that the programme can be delivered on line as well as face-to-face.\r\n\r\nThe incentive for this project was that outside the formal education system, existing structures for supporting young entrepreneurs are not working. The popular  \u2018one-stop-shop\u2019 model presupposes that someone already has a business idea and focuses on how this can be taken to market. Young people need much earlier intervention to help them think creatively and generate the ideas. Also there is a problem of scale and the standard formal instruments (such as bank-generated business plans etc) do not meet the needs of, for example, the 16 yr old who wants to start a window cleaning round.  Nor do the existing agencies actually provide real entrepreneurship skills training or help young people set up alternative business models such as social enterprises. \r\n\r\nThere is no specific demographic targeted by the project but because all four partners are based in areas of high social deprivation, high unemployment, low educational achievement and an average of 25% of the population with household incomes below the official poverty line, many of the participants will be suffering from multiple disadvantage.\r\n\r\nA focus of the training for aspiring entrepreneurs is the embedding of communication, numeracy and IT skills into the technical training they receive in the workshops. The topics are also very different including using story-telling as a business tool, creating radio programmes about their business, using video workshops, creating digital histories and so on.\r\n\r\nAnother output is the creation of a suite of Mozilla Open badges for Young Entrepreneurs and a map of the entrepreneur competences they acquire against the Youthpass competences - which will together provide the accreditation and certification framework. \r\n\r\n400 young people will participate in the project and 20 other agencies and youth organisations will participate in events to enable them to roll out the model to their own organisations.\r\n\r\nImpacts are measured using standard impact indicators drawn from \u2018Effects and Impact\r\nof Entrepreneurship Programmes in Higher Education\u2019 (European Commission DG Enterprise and Industry 2012). Although this is not a higher education project, it nevertheless has the same aim - to increase the numbers of young entrepreneurs.  This report provides base-line data in 4 key dimensions against which the impact of enterprise education can be measured,  Adopting the same measurement scales and data collection tools also allow comparisons to be made between the impact of this project against the impact of university entrepreneurship programmes. \r\n\r\nThe most important targets for dissemination are policy makers and policy influencers and the medium term impacts will be a change in policy and a corresponding change in the nature of support available to young entrepreneurs which better matches their needs.  If this can be effected, long term benefits will be an increase in the number of new entrepreneurs, improved viability of their businesses and a corresponding improvement in the regional economies.", "http://www.pontydysgu.org", "PONTYDYSGU LIMITED", "erasmus_2015-2-UK01-KA205-014040_coordinator"], ["5BP", "Youth Work - Music and Cultural Entrepreneurship", "Welsh Association of Youth Clubs, Youth Cymru", 104678.0, "The aim of this project is to identify, design and test a best practice approach to engage and retain young people aged 16 to 25 in youth services using music as a medium. The project will look at achieving this by analysing existing methods and procedures that are used by each of the project partners\u2019 youth music projects and programmes. These youth music projects and programmes will include lead partner Youth Work Ireland's Irish Youth Music Awards, Samf\u00e9s, National confederation of youth clubs in Iceland (Iceland) Stuck Together project , the Five nations partners UK Youth, Youth Action Northern Ireland, Youth CYMRU and Youth Scotland's Big Music Project and Lithuanian Children & Youth Center practice in youth work looking at education through non formal methods.

It will have active users who will be champion certain updates on the site similar to an online publication or blog as well as having an internal backend where users can link together on further projects and discuss current policy and initiatives. The site will work off an ACL which stands for Access Control List, it will allow the project partners to manage the users of the site, and different groups. This will create extensive control on who can see what and who can edit or manage what. This online toolkit/site will be able to embed and host existing information available and will act as a very crucial hub and online community for youth workers, volunteers and policy makers within Europe and further afield. This project will tie into the  \u201cEU  Youth  Strategy  (2010 - 2018) policy  cooperation  framework  of  the  EU\u201d  by adhering to its main objectivesTo provide more and equal opportunities for young people in education and in the labour marketTo encourage young people to be active citizens and participate in societyAs youth clubs and projects provide a safe space for young people to develop new skills we believe this is the perfect space to develop a programme which will support the growth of these young people into cultural entrepreneurs.In a report by EY commissioned by Gesac entitled \u201cCreating growth - Measuring cultural and creative markets in the EU\u201d published in December 2014 we can see the importance of supporting and developing young people's skills and expertise within the creative and music industries that exist. As stated in the report these industries contribute to revenues of \u20ac535.9b with the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) contribute to 4.2% of Europe\u2019s GDP. The sector is its third-largest employer, after construction and food and beverage service activities, such as bars and restaurants.The project will have a significant impact on a European level by creating a pan European youth focussed programme which will further contribute to empowerment of young people to express themselves as well as further upskilling them to explore third level education thus leading them to further contribute to the growth of the music and cultural industries that exist across Europe.
