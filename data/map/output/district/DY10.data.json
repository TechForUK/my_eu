CleanPEA will purpose it to support and encourage corporate fleet owners/operators to make the change from diesel-/petrol-powered, Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV \u2013 cars and vans) to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) equivalent. This will help the EU meet its demanding CO2 emission reduction targets, as cars and vans contribute around 15% of all CO2 emissions across Europe . Fleet Innovations Ltd. (FLEET) is an ambitious, Innovative-Driven Enterprise (IDE) with a strong desire to internationalise their business and led by a team of experts and serial entrepreneurs in providing data capture/reporting technology systems and fleet management solutions to track corporate business mileage/journey data. While engaging in customer building activities for our current solution (PEAK Miles), we discovered a strong desire among commercial corporations with company LCV fleets to switch to EVs as a way of cutting their cost and meeting their carbon reduction obligations . Europe\u2019s corporate fleets produce around 380Mt CO2 emission annually, accounting for around 8% of all EU emissions . We have conservatively estimated that the successful commercialisation of CleanPEA will allow us to generate new cumulative revenues and profits respectively of \u20ac94.32m and \u20ac57.55m (EBITDA) 6 years post project (2022). As a result, we would create 91 new jobs across Europe and directly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by 609,780 tonnes.", 37942.0, 54204.0, "CleanPEA", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_199266_939031490"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DY10"}
