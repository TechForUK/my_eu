At it's heart is the is the Government's Prevent Duty for England and Wales.  Educational organisations must comply with the Prevent duty and take a due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism.  Indeed, in England this is now a mandatory part of the OfSTED inspection for Further Education (FE) colleges. Surrounding this, however, are the wider issues that support Prevent in FE colleges - namely equality and diversity, inclusion and safeguarding.  Colleges within the AoC membership (England) have appointed Prevent co-ordinators whose responsibility it is to undertake to develop and deliver Prevent training to colleagues at all levels across the organisation - from governors to senior leadership teams, from academic staff to support staff. This duty sits within a college's safeguarding responsibilities and links closely with equality and diversity.  Many colleges are tying all these areas in together when addressing the Prevent duty.   These are all issues that our partners in the Netherlands and Sweden face.  With large, ethnically diverse student populations, our partners share many of the challenges of those in the UK, but they also face particular issues such as forced marriages in the Netherlands and defection to Syria in Sweden within the locality of one of the partner colleges. The objectives of this project are to organise two group study visits (one to each country) to enable those tasked with this area of focus within their work to learn about the challenges faced in partner countries, share experience and expertise and identify new approaches to this very important and mandatory area of work.  30 participants will be drawn from AoC member colleges and the AoC staff team.  Member college participants will all have a responsibility for safeguarding and Prevent and AoC staff team members will all be working within a policy setting  around safeguarding and Prevent to ensure maximum benefit both individually and at a wider level.The main activities will be the two study visit programmes in either Sweden or the Netherlands.  Each study visit will include a national overview of the VET system in each country and of the specific challenges around safeguarding, preventing radicalisation and equality and diversity, visits to hosting partner colleges to meet and talk to staff engaged in this area of work, gain an understanding of the local community environment where colleges are based, finishing with a one day joint peer learning conference with best practice case study presenters from both sides and round table discussions.In terms of intended outcomes we envisage that these will be the opportunity to:*Share and gain knowledge around equality & diversity, preventing extremism/radicalisation and other issues and challenges around certain minority ethnic groups of students e.g. forced marriage, genital mutilation. *Learn new approaches to working with ethnically diverse learner groups and communities.*Spend time away from the workplace with other UK participants who have a similar remit allowing for reflection on practice, the chance for group discussion on national strategy and a group approach to discussions with EU partners.*Visit Dutch or Swedish colleges, understand the context in which they are working and the learning environment.*Hear other countries' national strategies/directives around safeguarding and preventing radicalisation through briefings from government departments and/or national experts.*Engage in a peer learning day with Dutch or Swedish staff who are implementing strategies within their colleges to meet the challenges that they face.*Forge professional partnerships for continued dialogue around this area of work.*Find potential partners for further European level partnership projects.Potential longer term benefits include:*Cultural understanding of another EU country & promoting EU experience benefits to other staff & learners as a means to increasing skills and knowledge and potential future EU project partnerships;*The embedding of EU examples of best practice into Prevent and Safeguarding training for staff across colleges and into Equality & Diversity sessions to learners;*Learning will hopefully feed into individual college's Prevent strategies which are part of a college's internal quality assurance process and are directly inspected through the OfSTED inspection framework;*Learning outcomes from the project will be shared in particular with DBIS, the Home Office and the Education & Training Foundation (who are working with AoC around the provision of Prevent related training for colleges) and will hopefully inform future national strategies and identify future training needs around this area of work.", "http://www.aoc.co.uk", "Association of Colleges", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA102-023543_coordinator"], ["1HU", "SHARING KNOWLEDGE IN INNOVATION PROJECTS", "Association of Colleges", 87694.0, "Our proposal is a consequence of the results of an analysis conducted jointly by the three organizations IKASLAN, TKNIKA and the Deputy Ministry of Vocational Training and Lifelong Learning of the Basque government .

The project originated, in fact,from the desire to increase the opportunities for professional growth of learners through a working experience that can allow them to be in touch with the different social-cultural realities  but also with a concept of both living and working  in a different way.The intent is to let them get both a know-how and some good practices  to be internalized  and brought back when returnng in Italy,in order to use them then for their own professional future and for a greater development of the territory.\r\nThe project will have an impact not only on the current education of beneficiaries but also on the proponent and on members of the Consortium that will give life to new contacts with local and foreign companies and they will  both extend their network of schools and stimulate the staff to subscribe to European platforms in order to communicate with colleagues to share good practices and to increase the  visibility through the Erasmus mobility.\r\nIn a short term period  the project aims to generate,at least for the 70% of learners,the possibility to continue the work that  began   with the internship abroad and it wants to reserve a fast track because of searching  of employment for  beneficiaries,succeeding to ensure then some  proposals for further placements when returning from mobility abroad.\r\nIn addition,the dissemination step will alert not only the entire school community,but also families, institutions, agencies,local businesses and stakeholders,bringing the results in terms of learning outcomes and good practices in the tables of comparison and to the attention of professionals related to the world of education and vocational training, in order to match  more training courses with the labor market.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA102-006280_9"], ["1HU", "Developing Good Practice in Safeguarding Students", "Association of Colleges", 78741.0, "Developing Good Practice in Safeguarding Students is a mobility project for Vocational Education and Training (VET) staff working for the Association of Colleges (AoC) or one of its English member colleges.

Both focus areas are a high priority for AoC and it's member colleges.\r\n\r\nMental health support has recently been given much higher profile nationally with the government announcement that there would be a Green Paper on mental health support for young people.  Increasing, AoC  and it's members have seen the rise in mental health problems in our students.  AoC has led the development of a Mental Health Resource Pack its members and has formed a national Mental Health Advisory Group to support initiatives and mental health strategies.\r\n\r\nThe Prevent Duty is a mandatory part of the OfSTED Inspection for Further Education (FE) colleges.  Surrounding this, however, are the wider issues that support Prevent in FE colleges - namely equality and diversity, inclusion and safeguarding.  Colleges within the AoC membership have appointed Prevent co-ordinators whose responsibility it is to undertake to develop and deliver Prevent training to colleagues at all levels across the organisation.\r\n\r\nBoth areas of focus are issues that our EU partners face.  In Sweden, we are partnering with Gothenburg and Stockholm schools with large, ethnically diverse student populations, where they share many of the challenges of those in the UK, but they also face particular issues such as defection to Syria in Sweden within the locality of both colleges.  Both Dutch and Finnish partners also recognise the challenges increasingly faced by students within their schools and the important role that schools and colleges have in supporting young people with mental health challenges to enable them to complete their studies and take a happy and active role in society.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the study visits in this project are to enable those tasked with these areas of focus within their work in colleges (or at AoC) to learn about the challenges faced in partner countries, share experience and expertise and identify new approaches to these very important areas of work.\r\n\r\n60 participants will be drawn from AoC member colleges and the AoC staff team (15 participants per study visit).

Thus, the project is designed to complement exist tools for coordinating quality in educational institutions, in particular EQAVET, and in certain cases the ESGs by proposing cross-based methods for ensuring quality apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nThere is a lack of experiences, concepts and vision how to leverage the potential of practice and work-based learning for the field of VET which needs to be addressed through comprehensive quality criteria in order to given guidance and orientation how to structure those parts of VET which take part in the world of work.\r\n\r\nApprenticeshipQ will:\r\n\u2022 provide a clear framework for quality management of apprenticeships at the system, provider and company levels ensuring systematic feedback \r\n\u2022 foster mutual trust and respect through regular cooperation and better quality management between the apprenticeship partners\r\n\u2022 ensure the content of HVET programmes is responsive to changing skill needs in companies and society\r\n\u2022 ensure fair, valid, and authentic assessment of learning outcomes in apprenticeships \r\n\u2022 support the continuous professional development of in-company trainers and improving their working conditions\r\n\r\nIt will do this by:\r\n\u2022 identifying and analysing different forms of apprenticeships and work-based learning to design and test a typology of apprenticeships\r\n\u2022 identifying the strategic goals of the main stakeholders involved in HVET to inform quality management\r\n\u2022 identifying the factors that stakeholders consider essential for QM within the strategic partnership\r\nproviding a set of best-practice examples for QM at education institutions and at training/placement sites\r\n\u2022 identifying QM success factors and best practices in different education institutions, in different industry sectors \r\n\r\nThis knowledge will be made useful for target groups including institutions, enterprises and students by creating:\r\n\u2022 an institutional quality management framework for apprenticeships\r\n\u2022 an online-assessment tool for quality management\r\n\u2022 an apprenticeships QM Manual for educational institutions containing instruments, methods and tools they can work with to develop a joint quality culture between themselves and small and medium enterprises \r\n\u2022 an apprenticeships QM Manual for enterprises containing instruments, methods and tools they can work with to develop a joint quality culture between themselves and educational organizations \r\n\r\nThe project will consult extensively with stakeholders to forge consensus in the field, including by organising:\r\n\u2022 Workshops in 6 countries involving more than 300 QM experts, other expert stakeholders from training and education site\r\n\u2022 Field test in 6 countries involving more than 300 employers, quality managers, trainer and teachers, HVET institutions, etc.\r\n\u2022 Survey in 6 countries involving more than 1.200 employers, QM person responsible from the placement as well as the HVET institution site, teachers and trainers\r\nThrough the involvement of chambers of commerce, standardization bodies and associations of European institutions of Higher VET in the project, ApprenticeshipQ has the potential to reach a wide impact, and ensure uptake of its processes amongst both enterprises and HVET institutions.\r\n\r\nThis in turn will lead to improved quality management and hence improved quality of apprenticeships in Higher VET around Europe, which should in turn increase the attractiveness of HVET as an educational pathway.", "http://www.aoc.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA202-004164_4"], ["1HU", "SHERPA", "Association of Colleges", 109346.0, "The issue of immigration and the integration of immigrants are high on the policy agenda of EU and OECD countries, both from an economic and a social point of view.

It is also critical for facilitating their acceptance by the host-country population. \r\n\r\nBut, why are some European economies and societies far more successful than others in integrating immigrants into their labour markets and why are they better in offering opportunities to young immigrants to unfold their talents and obtain qualifications ?\r\n\r\nRecent OECD research clearly made this point about large differences in the performance of European countries regarding integration and equal opportunities. \r\nIn order to find Good Practices from several countries and to learn from each other about successful strategies, there will be  meetings in all partner countries.  The core-business  is to shed the light on every participating country, to share good experiences and to clarify the national and regional interventions.  The demonstrated examples, presentations and instruments will provide the participants with tools to improve their own policy and instruments. At the end of each meeting, every partner describes their learning results and whether the Good Practices could be used in their own country or not.
