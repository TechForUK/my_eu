The Welsh government has funded these posts and have developed policies and strategies across a number of sectors (including education) in order to increase the number of fluent Welsh speakers in Wales. The Basque country has faced similar problems to Wales in that they have seen a significant decrease in the number of people who can speak Basque, over recent centuries, and have successfully increased the number of fluent speakers to 32% (in 2011), compared to previous years (29.5% in 2001, 27.7% in 1996 and 24.1% in 1991). The most recent census in Wales saw a decrease in the number of Welsh speakers (down from 21% in 2001 to 19% in 2011), there is an opportunity here (in terms of added value) to share practices, methods, policies, strategies and for two countries with similar linguistic backgrounds to be able to support each other to develop within the Further Education sector. These developments are essential in order to create a successful workforce in Wales that can compete in difficult economic circumstances - research has shown that individuals with Welsh language skills are more likely to gain employment and perform better at higher qualifications in Wales. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObjectives of Project:\r\n\r\nTo raise the profile and share good practice of post-14 bilingual and Welsh medium provision in the Basque country.\r\n\r\nTo learn about the strategic direction set out by the Government in the Basque country in order for them to be able to increase the number of fluent speakers in the country.\r\n\r\nTo establish whether working in partnership (and with which organisations) is crucial to achieving a substantial increase in the number of fluent speakers (of the Basque language).\r\n\r\nTo understand how the Government in the Basque country monitors objectives set out in policy and strategy documents to increase the number of fluent speakers (of the Basque language).\r\n\r\nTo observe good practice in relation to practitioner  training (Professional Graduate Certificate in Education) in Higher Education establishments, in particular, aspects of delivering post-14 provision bilingually or through the medium of a minority language.\r\n\r\nTo create new partnerships and understanding between Further Education establishments in Wales with Further and Higher Education establishments in the Basque country in order to develop a wider communication network.\r\n\r\nTo continue to improve the quality of Welsh medium and bilingual post-14 provision through the consideration of adopting practices and policies currently being implemented within educational establishments in the Basque country. \r\n\r\nTo share good practice in Welsh post-14 education with key individuals and establishments in the Basque country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nFour Further Education Colleges and CollegesWales (the body that represents Colleges in Wales). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of activities:\r\n\r\nVisits with Government officials to learn about Basque language planning.\r\n\r\nVisit with a University to learn about Teacher Training in terms of bilingualism.\r\n\r\nVisit with a Vocation Education provider to learn about bilingual post-16 provision.\r\n\r\nShare good practices from Wales. \r\n\r\nLearn about effective partnership work and its impact on bilingualism and language planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults and Impact:\r\n\r\nNew skills and knowledge developed in minority language planning and bilingual post-16 provision and delivery.

The job was funded for one year (1/11/10 - 1/11/11) by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome of the International Coordinator's role was to submit a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011 on behalf of the FE sector in Wales.  This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the first year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility - the focus on improving teaching and learning within the FE sector in Wales has proved to be the catalyst for submitting a consortium application for funding in 2014 under Erasmus+ for staff mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.   This is CollegesWales' first application for staff mobility funding and CollegesWales is the organising partner and 7 FE colleges with 8 partner organisations based in Wales.

PARTNERSHIP\r\nThrough this project, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA envisage to resume the partnership established in 2014 as part of the successful Mobility bid in the area of Vocational Education and Training (VET), having as target group students undergoing vocational education and training in various vocational qualification. \r\nThe first activities and experiences gathered in conjunction with the implementation of the mobility bid selected for funding in 2014, project title \" TYPISCH BRITISCH\", together with the implementation of a UK successful bid, with mobility flows being sent from the UK to AKKL, have motivated the project management team of both institutions, AKKL and COLEG CAMBRIA, to resume the successfully started cooperation and also include another UK-based college in this new project. \r\nDue to the increased interest in mobility work-based learning placements in the UK, as expressed by the German students, following AKKL\u00b4s project application funded in 2014, AKKL commenced searching for an additional potential project partner. Given the already existing work contacts with COLEG CAMBRIA, based in Wrexham/Wales/UK, AKKL had the opportunity to learn about GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI, also based in North Wales, in the UK. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. \r\nGRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2014 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner. \r\n2. NEEDS \r\nBased upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 10 flows spanning 2 years, from 2015 until 2017, for 150 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO. \r\nWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. \r\nThe linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities. \r\n3. OBJECTIVES \r\nFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2015 until 2017, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding. \r\nHence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. \r\nOn the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 10 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2015 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2015 bidding session. \r\n4. OUTCOMES\r\nThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market. \r\n5.

The Veneto Region since 2006 launched ad hoc initiatives to encourage the spread of this new concept of entrepreneurship. Companies more careful to the challenges of the future have already recognised the validity of the 'triple bottom line'model\u2019 (which notes the impact of corporate behavior on the economic, social and environmental level).

The selected host countries are: Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Ireland.\r\nThey have been carefully chosen not only considering the foreign languages studied in the schools, but taking into account the different economic history of each one and then the different  way of implementation of CSR. The foreign partners are established reality in the field of training, expert about design, management, implementation of European projects in relation to staff and learners training,  and to vocational training in the company of students and graduates.\r\nAs for staff mobility, emphasis was placed to seek partners already active in the ErasmusPlus  field and particularly reliable. They are able not only to strengthen the language skills but offer job shadowing experiences that allow a) the transfer of best practices in use in partner countries schools; b) the strengthening of cooperation with local and transnational bodies involved in the partnership network.\r\nThe impact on learners will be the development of professional, personal and international skills and competences as tools to facilitate integration into the labor market and the reading enterprises\u2019 needs.

GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is the result of the merger between 3 colleges, as follows: Coleg Llandrillo (Llandrillo), Coleg Meirion on Wyfor and Coleg Menai. GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI\u00b4s educational offer, as well as COLEG CAMBRIA\u00b4s, matches well the German vocational qualifications provided by AKKL, as the experiences gathered in conjunction with the bid funded in 2015 proved. Hence, GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI is a good match as the second hosting partner.2. NEEDS Based upon the increased interest and needs of AKKL\u00b4s German IVT students to participate in European vocational mobility placements, AKKL has planned a total of 8 flows spanning 2 years, from 2016 until 2018, for 120 IVT vocational students undertaking the apprenticeship scheme in Germany, with 2 UK-based hosting institutions, COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLOWithout the opportunity offered by the ERASMUS+ programme, AKKL\u00b4s apprentices, throughout their vocational training, would never have the chance to undertake work-based learning activities in another European country and thus gather both practical, work-related experiences, as well as personal, intercultural experiences. The linguistic competences of the target group are rather poor and can be improved by participating in such work-based learning mobility activities.3. OBJECTIVESFor the vocational courses provided by AKKL spanning 2016 until 2087, the internationalisation strategy of the institution shall be resumed by implementing a new mobility project, targeting the  vocational qualifications preferred by the institution, by offering work-based learning placements in the UK, financially backed up by EU funding.Hence, five two-week mobility placements have been planned, financially supported by ERASMUS+ and hosted by COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - COLEG LLANDRILLO, both based in Wales, in the UK. On the other hand, COLEG CAMBRIA, beginning with autumn 2015, is planning to send out a comparable number of 8 IVT student flows to AKKL, as included in their 2016 KA1 VET Mobility bid in the UK, shall their project application be selected for funding in this bidding round. The same is also planned by GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI for the 2016 bidding session.4. OUTCOMESThrough these mobility placements, the German apprentices shall gather hands-on, intercultural and linguistic competences by taking part in work placements with two different UK-based Vocational Colleges. This should enable the participants of this mobility project to move more easily and flexibly in the German, as well as European labour market.5. COMPOSITION AND TIMESPANS OF FLOWSAn overall number of 120 vocational students/apprentices (see qualifications below) are planned to be sent out to COLEG CAMBRIA and GRWP LLANDRILLO MENAI - LLANDRILLO COLLEGE, grouped in 8 separate flows each.

This policy framework is being implemented and is to a large extend operational. Concrete results and improvements are made compared to the previous years and these results are clearly visible. In 2017 is a central international information point is set up, the website GO Abroad! is made operational, a digital guideline is developed, an expertgroep and workinggroup (including all sectors) are operational and several workshops and promotional activities are carried out. This has led to a growing enthusiasm for international activities in the organisation. \r\n \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\nInternationalisation fits in the overall policy of Gilde that everybody should be able to graduate as being \"internationally competent\".  Internships abroad are not the only way to realize this. It is also about integrating internationalisation in the study programs. For example via minors, language courses, guest speakers from abroad, excursions etc. (internationalisation @ home). For Gilde, it is an opportunity  to provide for students an added value on the labour market and to provide them more insight in other cultures and languages.\r\n\r\nFor the next coming year, Gilde Opleidingen has the objective to improve both the quality as the quantity of internships abroad. Both for students as for staff, at European level and at Euregional level. \r\nIn concrete terms, the following points of attention are defined:\r\n- strengthening the sectors in the proposal and collaboration;\r\n- further implementing internationalisation in the policy of Gilde;\r\n- attention for intercultural and language skills in the educational programs;\r\n- strengthening and optimizing the central information point of Gilde;\r\n- strengthening the communication and collaboration structure internally;\r\n- promoting internships abroad as an option for professionalisation for staff and teachers;\r\n- promoting working and learning across the borders with the Euregio (Germany, Belgium).  \r\n\r\nThe activities that are defined to realize the objectives are already put in place in 2017 and they will be continued in 2018.  Keywords are: SENSIBILISATION, COMMUNICATION  and SUPPORT. Collaboration will take place both at internal as external level. \r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS:\r\nIn the call 2018, the following numbers of students and staff are included:\r\nstudents short term: 96\r\nstudents ErasmusPro: 85\r\nteachers and staff: 39 \r\n\r\nThe total number of participants is increased significantly compared to the previous years. One of the reasons is a growing enthousiasm of students and staff, due to promotional activities, active collaboration and a workshop for staff. It seems that there is a growing motivation for mobility and an improved trust in the coordination, the organisation and the realisation of mobility activities. \r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACT:\r\nBased on experiences of previous years, it is proven that an experience abroad is an added value for both students as for teachers and other staff. Not only in a professional way, but also in a personal way. By executing a part of the education in a context abroad, the complexity of the learning process increases considerably. This is something that we can never achieve within the safe environment of an educational institute. The students are better prepared for the labour market and are also less vulnerable on the labour market. For Gilde this is important towards the companies in the EUregio. Companies just across the border have a growing need for well trained and skilled people and Gilde can foresee in this need. \r\n\r\nThe experiences in this project will be evaluated (also via the particpant reports) and on the basis of the results of the students. This provides input for the preparation and the evaluation and for the improvement of the working processes. \r\n\r\nLONG TERM VISION:\r\nIn some of the VET programs it is almost a \"must\" to have international experiences. This is esepcially the case in the hospitality sector (tourism).\r\nHowever, as described earlier, an international experience offers more than only professional experiences. Therefore, an international experiences is relevant for everybody should be part of more VET programs at Gilde, so that everybody can leave the educational institute internationally competent.

Our school is located in the country which makes it difficult for them to move. As a result their motivation is very low and looking for a work placement in a company is far from easy. So few of them consider the pursuit of studies and most of them get no job opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the opportunities to be hired, our students will have to :\r\n\r\n- stand out from the lot. A work placement in a Spanish or British company will enable them to improve their Spanish and English. It will be an asset in their CVs, proving their will, their competences in a foreign language, their autonomy and their ability to move.\r\n\r\n- get more self-confident thanks to the acquisition of new competences and recognition within the school, the family and the company.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, we got in touch with a Spanish training center where students prepare for a diploma in administration and management and do an internship in a company, and a vocational school in Wales\r\n\r\nThese schools and our school are willing to collaborate and compare our methods through periods of job shadowing, prepare our students for their mobility and select the companies where they will do their internships.\r\n\r\nWe would like to give the opportunity to a few students to do a training period in another European country, swapping their internship companies. \r\n\r\nIn order to prepare the trip as well as possible, Iwe wish to collaborate with the Spanish or english teacher and use DNL (professionnal subject in a foreign language) lessons to train our students with the appropriate Spanish or English  vocabulary, to the professional tasks they would have to fulfil during the workplacement. We will also tutor the students who prepare their mobility (one hour a week).\r\n\r\nThis project is for students of the second and the last year of managerial and administrative vocational diploma, who would have done 3 training periods in different companies in France.\r\n\r\nVery few students (4 at the beginning) will be selected to do this training abroad to gain additional experience.\r\n\r\nOur students will :\r\n\r\n- have a better knowledge of education systems,\r\n\r\n- gain linguistic and professional skills,\r\n\r\n- develop European exchange and European citizenship,\r\n\r\n- gain confidence to make a six-month placement in other countries when they pass their exam and carry on their studies in higher education.\r\n\r\n- to add mobility and knowledge in their CVs.\r\n\r\nThe sectors of activity which can be reached with this diploma, require autonomy, adaptability, mobility and language knowledge.

We committed into a KA 2 project with the Spanish training center along with a German and Italian school. The exchange with the Spanish training center will give the opportunity to some Spanish students to carry out an internship in our French companies.\r\n\r\nThe internships abroad really represent an achievement and a feeling of great fulfilment for the students and gives motivation to other students.\r\n\r\nWe would like to do the same project with an English-speaking school.

Although tourism has a broadly positive impact on economic growth and employment, it is also a resource-intensive industry that leaves a large footprint on the environment and it can also threaten cultural heritage and local food production.\r\n\r\nTherefore, sustainable tourism and CSR in the tourism industry are intensively promoted by political decision makers as well as by an increasing number of customers and guests. In this context, sustainability and CSR have become standard elements of all good quality training at the VET and HE level within the last 10 years. Also large tourism chains and global operating service provides usually apply CSR standards.\r\n\r\nHowever, one target group has had so far very little contact with the concepts, philosophy, methods and instruments of sustainability and CSR in tourism: micro and small to medium enterprises. Their managers usually have no access to information about CSR and, in any case, CSR concepts have to date not been tailor-made for micro and small enterprises. The trouble is that 95% of companies in the tourism sector employ fewer than 10 people. This brings us to the situation that the vast majority of tourism providers in Europe have not even heard of CSR let alone applied it.\r\nIn order to overcome this situation, the project group has developed three main intellectual outputs: \r\nA) Implementation of a European survey to obtain a clear picture of the extent to which CSR is known in the tourism industry, especially within micro and small sized enterprises. The survey will be implemented all over Europe and will investigate issues such as general knowledge about CSR standards, the prestige of CSR with tourism managers, fields of interest, demand and needs.

One year after the projects has ended, 50 VET and HE providers should be offering this service to several thousand enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe BEST BOSS policy paper will raise general awareness and give all political decision makers clear guidelines and recommendation of what needs to be done next to overcome the shortage of company successors in Europe\u2019s largest sector of the tourism industry.\r\n\r\nAll project activities are embedded in a wide range of evaluation and dissemination activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partnership contains eight organisations; four of them are VET or HE providers specialised in the fields of tourism and tourism management; one is an association of tourism service providers, one is a coordination office for company succession, one is chamber of commerce working for many years in the field of company succession and one is the largest European network for the dissemination of EU project results. They have all the skills, experience, and resources needed for implementing this project successfully. Representing DE, AT, BE, BG, SI, RO and the UK the partnership will ensure an appropriate European dimension as well as a fine split between larger and smaller countries with differently developed tourism sectors.
