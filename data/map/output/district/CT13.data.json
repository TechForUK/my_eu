Besides being a multi-component system, it also modulates the endocannabinoid (EC) signalling. Blocking the NGF signaling system is therefore a rational and thoroughly validated approach to pain therapy. Extensive evidence for potent analgesic efficacy of antiNGF mAbs has been obtained in preclinical models and in clinical trials,showing remarkable analgesic efficacy and creating great expectations for this new class of analgesic compounds.However, potential safety concerns related to off-target side effects have been raised and recently the FDA called for more preclinical research. To fully exploit the huge therapeutic potential of NGF system, we built a consortium of leading researchers in the NGF, EC and pain scientific arena.The innovative proposal will investigate new strategies for the treatment of different NP forms, based on the NGF system and its interplay with EC signalling, focussing at different levels of the pain transmission and perception systems.\nThe project results will provide solid, mechanism-based grounds for the development of already identified second-generation therapeutics, based on the \u201cNGF target\u201d system, as well as for the identification and validation of new druggable targets emerging from the elucidated mechanisms. It will also identify biomarkers for NP, validated in animal models and clinical samples, that could result in future clinical benefits, for the stratification of patients suffering from different neuropathies and their treatment.\nThe project will contribute to the understanding and controlling NP mechanisms, with an interdisciplinary approach, leading to the development of next-generation NGF targeting drugs.", 217882.0, 6326318.0, 6, 9, "PAINCAGE", "http://www.paincage.eu/", null, null, "fp7_185456_951108863"]]}}, "9NJ": {"cordis": {"data": [[1391212800000, 1580428800000, "European Gram Negative Antibacterial Engine", "The Research Network Ltd.", "The intensive use and misuse of antibiotics has resulted in some level of antibiotic resistance in essentially all human bacterial pathogens.  There is a growing concern that the loss of therapeutic options will present us with a post-antibiotic era where present and future medical advances are negated.  Resistant bacteria dramatically reduce the possibilities of treating infections effectively, and drastically increase the risk of complications with a fatal outcome.  Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.  Despite the recognized need for new antimicrobials for clinical use, the reality is that only two new classes of antibiotics have been brought to market in the last 30 years and many drug developers have left the field.  This urgency is especially true when considering resistant Gram-negative infections where carbapenem-resistance is rising and use of drugs of last resort, such as colistin, is increasing. The New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs (ND4BB) initiative is a series of programmes designed to directly address some of the scientific challenges associated with antibacterial drug discovery and development.  The ND4BB ENABLE consortium will meet the challenges ahead by creating and optimising a portfolio of new antibiotics ranging from Hits through Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe overarching goals of the ENABLE consortium are to: 1) create a drug discovery platform with the expertise and resource base to prosecute multiple antibacterial programmes in parallel; and 2) increase the overall pipeline in the antibacterial area by applying this platform to optimise a variety of antibacterial programmes.  More specifically the key objectives of the consortium are designed to increase the overall pipeline of high quality, novel mode of action medicines to treat serious systemic Gram-negative infections by identifying three antibacterial Leads, two antibacterial Candidates and progressing at least one compound into preclinical and Phase 1 clinical studies.\n\nThe platform group is made up of academics and SMEs from across Europe with the diverse expertise including from clinical microbiology, in vivo pharmacology, computational and medicinal chemistry, ADME profiling, PKPD modelling, pharmaceutics, assay development and screening all needed to undertake this programme.  This group, coupled with additional expertise and advice from within the EFPIA partners, will bring an unrivalled focus and breadth of judgment to this important area of research.  \n\nThe programmes are coming from institutions across Europe, initially with seven efforts from public partners, and arising from a novel discovery stage alliance between GSK and Sanofi.  These initial programmes to be considered for ENABLE cover a diverse landscape of targets and approaches including natural products, PNA-peptides, synthetic small molecules, and follow ups / improvements to medicines already available.  In addition, soon after initiation, ENABLE will launch an open call for additional efforts to create a sustainable portfolio of antibacterial discovery programmes moving forward. \n\nThe ENABLE consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a productive collaboration between leading European academic researchers, SMEs and the pharmaceutical industry. We believe these interactions will be synergistic for everyone concerned. Bringing together different disciplines for the common goals outlined in this proposal will make Europe the world-leader in antimicrobial drug discovery.

This capacity building project will build up the infrastructure for the other E&T projects and in future calls initiated by IMI, and will facilitate mobility between academia, industry, regulators, and other relevant stakeholders/potential employers.\nBased on extensive mapping of existing resources in Europe and on a gap and overlap\nanalysis, the consortium will develop and implement a strategy for pan-European expansion,for harmonisation and accreditation of continuing professional development (CPD) programmes in context of life-long learning under the umbrella of the IMI cross-project LifeTrain initiative (WP4/7). The consortium will provide a comprehensive registry of Master level and PhD programmes, as well as of CPD programmes. It will provide an overview of existing innovative learning concepts, tools and methodologies in conjunction with the other IMI E&T projects that will support the content for the IMI education programmes. National implementation will be facilitated through close contacts with national university authorities, ministries of higher education, and through the availability of national liaison contact persons.\nAfter implementation in a core group of institutions, extension is planned both within the countries represented in EMTRAIN and in additional countries, helped by dissemination and communication activities. The harmonisation and the modular nature of these programmes will allow trans-disciplinary curricula as well as trans-border and trans-sectoral mobility, and PhD programmes will be designed to foster industry/academia mobility and collaboration.\nThe public Consortium is made up of the six pan-European biomedical science (BMS)\nresearch infrastructures from the ESFRI roadmap, and the Medizinische Universitaet Wien\nas managing entity. The six ESFRI-BMS research infrastructures cover a broad spectrum of\ncompetences from molecules to humans: structural biology (Instruct), bioinformatics\n(ELIXIR), animal models (INFRAFRONTIER), biobanks (BBMRI), translational research\n(EATRIS) and clinical research (ECRIN). These distributed infrastructures are based on\nresources and facilities located in a majority of EU countries, and have their own education and training programmes. EMTRAIN can therefore take advantage of their broad spectrum of competences, of their pan-European dimension, of their close contacts with national authorities (national ministries of higher education and research are partners in these initiatives), and of already existing national liaisons. Members of the six ESFRI-BMS infrastructures will be responsible for leading the work packages WPs 2-9 in collaboration with members of the EFPIA.\nThe EFPIA consortium has considerable experience in education and training; management;\nprovides a pan-European geographical outreach, and draws on an extensive external\nnetwork of contacts.

Its global human and economic burden is tremendous and increasing annually. Yet today only a few pharmaceutical companies retain active antibacterial drug discovery programmes. While the elaboration of antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action is scientifically complex, the chief challenge is diminishing incentives. Pre-market regulatory requirements and increased control on post-market access, use, and pricing of new antibiotics are strong deterrents to drug development. Meanwhile, healthcare payers are not currently prepared to reimburse antibiotics at prices that would support the cost of development.\n\nApplied to antibiotics, a simple sales-based economic model contradicts the public health mandate to reduce their consumption in order to preserve their efficacy. Alternative models that can create incentives for the discovery of novel antibiotics and yet reconcile these incentives with responsible antibiotic use are long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder DRIVE-AB consortium composed of 16 public and 8 private partners from 12 countries will produce new models in a stepwise yet interconnected process.  To achieve this objective, the DRIVE-AB consortium has put together a strong team that comprises both currently active researchers on the antibiotics problem and new researchers who can bring a fresh perspective as well as experience from other industries, economic specialties, and business cultures. The academic team has been enriched by EFPIA members and stakeholders from various backgrounds. With this diverse, yet closely tied team, DRIVE-AB will deliver fresh, sustainable solutions to this complex problem.\n\nFirst, we will develop an evidence-based, consensus definition for \u201cresponsible antibiotic use,\u201d which, with its standardised quality and quantity indicators, will provide the framework for all later steps. Next, data from surveillance systems, antibiotic prescription databases, and published literature will inform estimations of the present burden of antibiotic resistance from both clinical and economic perspectives across varying socioeconomic backdrops. Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics. The most promising schemes will be presented to policymakers and other stakeholders with attendant implementation and risk-management strategies.\n\nThis ambitious project will not succeed if it is developed and championed merely by one sector of society, be it academia, \u201cbig pharma,\u201d or public health. The robustness and applicability of the proposed alternative models will only be proportional to their level of input from all involved players.

For the ~25% of children who experience relapses of their malignant solid tumors, usually after very intensive first-line therapy, curative treatment options are scarce. Preclinical drug testing to identify promising treatment options that match the molecular make-up of the tumor is hampered by the facts that i) molecular genetic data on pediatric solid tumors from relapsed patients and thus our understanding of tumor evolution and therapy resistance are very limited to date and ii) for many of the high-risk entities no appropriate and molecularly well characterized patient-derived models and/or genetic mouse models are currently available. Thus, quality-assured upfront preclinical testing of novel molecularly targeted compounds in a (saturated) repertoire of well-characterized models will establish the basis to increase therapeutic successes of these drugs in children with solid malignancies.

However, without a biological rationale for these disorders, drug development has dramatically stagnated in the past decades. In a coordinated effort encompassing academic experts, SMEs, patient and family organizations, regulators, ECNP and EFPIA partners, this project aims to develop a quantitative biological approach to the understanding and classification of neuropsychiatric diseases to accelerate the discovery and development of better treatments for patients. This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available. Data integration of genetic and epigenetic studies through an innovative molecular landscaping approach will lead to the identification of new biological substrates and candidate genes underlying these phenotypic domains. These will provide the basis for reverse translation and construct validation studies in rodents which will be tested in behavioural, cognitive, EEG and O2 amperometry paradigms that are homologous to those performed in the clinical deep phenotyping study. Where appropriate, the clinical studies will inform on the use of appropriate perturbations, including genetic modification to the systems and substrates being probed. Additional preclinical studies will extend the characterisation of the substrates underlying the integrated socio-cognitive traits beyond simple reverse translation by exploiting higher spatial or temporal resolution techniques such as 2-photon imaging, single unit electrophysiology, in vivo micro-dialysis and biosensors.\nTogether, these studies will provide new classification and assessment tools", null, 14746467.0, 8, 23, "PRISM", null, "http://www.pfizer.co.uk", null, "h2020_209457_998133396"]]}}}}
