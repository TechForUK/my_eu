The most commonly used concrete piles are the pre-cast concrete piles and the cast in-situ concrete piles. Cast in-situ concrete piles are limited in the length or depth at which it could be cast unlike pre-cast piles (it can be extended to greater depths using mechanical joints). Apart from its advantage in installation depth, pre-cast concrete piles are becoming more preferred because of the decreasing length of the individual pile sections before installation. There are equipments and method available for concrete pile integrity testing that is time and cost effective (e.g. ultrasonic testing), but they have limitations especially when testing pre-cast piles. Therefore, our idea is to produce an innovative quality assurance system to enable a cost effective, efficient and reliable means of monitoring the integrity of pre-cast concrete piles through out its supply chain from manufacturing up until after its installation. The proposed project would involve the development of: \u00b7 A means of recording and accessing pile information (pile number, batch number, pile location, periodic integrity check results etc) using an embedded ID tag on each pile; \u00b7 A means of verifying a number of piles used to form a segmented pile has been properly driven (installed) into the ground and can hold a given amount of weight. This would be done by developing an innovative concrete pile manufacturing process to slightly embed a conductive circuit path through the pile common failure areas to allow current passage through the pile, which would allow for the detection of changes in resistivity due to cracks or strain to the concrete pile using an intelligent monitoring technique. This could be a means to verify the possibility of reusing a concrete pile if the case arises.", 360354.0, 1218298.0, "PILE-MON", null, null, null, "http://pilemon.pera.com/", null, null, "fp7_92515_999435815"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1EE", "Auslandspraktikum zur Fokussierung eines Arbeitsplatzes in Europa", "Ulster Carpets Mills Limited", 21925.0, "A central educational objective of the school program of the vocational college Werther Br\u00fccke is to integrate as many students in the increasingly growing  European labour market.

The Project will develop adult educators\u2019 competences within both the community learning centres and further education institutions to deal with diversified groups of learners, making use of new technologies and teaching outcomes.\r\n\r\nThis project also seeks to address the Erasmus+ horizontal principle \"Inclusive education, training and youth\"   by seeking to provide a critical insight into promoting equality and inclusion  developing tutors to address diversity and integration in (formal and non-formal) delivery to learners who are local, migrant, refugee and asylum seekers.  This also underpins the priority of the Paris Declaration.  This project ultimately promotes inclusive education and training within local communities  fostering a culture of respect and mutual understanding. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n> To work collaboratively with 6 transnational partner organizations based in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Latvia & Sweden  who have particular expertise in delivery to adult education migrant/refugee/asylum seeker/  communities by developing, testing, adapting and supporting the embedding of innovative materials and practices;\r\n\r\n>To develop innovative materials for adult tutors/practitioners which  will be initially delivered to 25 adult tutors through a transnational training course based on Social Inclusion and Diversity.\r\n\r\n> Following this, the 25 tutors will pilot the materials with 100 adults learners during the life of the project, giving on-going feedback on the benefits of the materials and any changes necessary;\r\n\r\n> To ultimately develop an online blended 16 hour social inclusion and diversity  course which includes a pedagogical  handbook, associated materials including film documentaries, podcasts and real life case studies (with refugees, economic migrants, asylum seekers) for adult learners and their tutors.\r\n\r\n> To build new networks of support for each partner organisation and their tutors developing their outreach, capacity and skills base for future joint collaboration as well as internationalisation.\r\n\r\n> To share results with wider networks within each partner country growing their capacity to tackle racism within their own country\r\n\r\nThe impact on the the target group - adult learners will be:\r\nincreased knowledge of the needs of new migrants, refugees and asylum seekers\r\nnew approaches to learning about integration of new communities\r\nincreased sense of initiative \r\nincreased level of digital competence\r\nincreased levels of confidence, skills and cultural awareness\r\n\r\nThe impact on the Adult Education tutoring staff \r\nincreased level of confidence and competence in their pedagogical approaches with adult learners\r\nnew networks of support with other staff in a European context for future joint working great insights into European Citizenship for their Learners and their roles in supporting local as well as diverse groups of learners to become European citizens\r\nincreased bank of approaches, materials and case studies for use in the classroom/community\r\nincreased knowledge of the needs of new migrants, refugees and asylum seekers\r\nnew approaches to learning about integration of new communities\r\n\r\nThis partnership believe that the long term impact of this project will be to  prevent and tackle marginalisation, intolerance and racism within a framework of equal opportunities for all bu offering a range of innovative resources suitable for adult education across Europe.", "http://kettleoffish.film", "Southern Regional College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036563_1"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1BA", "Food for Thought", "WADE TRAINING LTD", null, "ESF", 168000.0, 420000.0, "esf_ni_129"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT62"}
