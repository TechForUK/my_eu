Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n\r\n2.

This is particularly so with young people who have poor records of academic achievement or are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in the UK will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this national shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootball clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFleetwood Town FC\u2019s dissemination activities will be complemented by our Austrian partner, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility.

The school has been teaching languages for 8 years. Our children are predominantly of white British heritage and are monolingual. The main objective for this project was to create a sustainable language teaching model in the school. \r\n\r\nThe school has  a duty to provide quality professional development so our teachers have the language competencies and confidence to teach, inspire and motivate children to learn a new language and develop their inter cultural understanding of another European country. We need to provide them with a rich language experience and develop their profile in Global Citizenship learning.  \r\n\r\nThe project outlines the need to strengthen language teaching in the school by up-skilling new teaching staff, embedding language teaching into the everyday curriculum and forming a platform for enhancing the awareness of global citizenship within the school. \r\n\r\n6 participants from the school community will undertake 8-day long French language and methodology immersion courses in France over a two year period. Activities on the course will include the opportunity to visit a French school and take part in French school activity. Participants will stay in a small French community. The French base, the local speaking community and the personalised approach enables staff to develop their skills at a rapid pace and gives meaning to the cultural aspect and the importance of learning a language. \r\n\r\nParticipants will lead staff meetings, and cascade ideas and best practice to the other members of their team so language learning can be fully developed throughout the school. Presentations will be made to the wider school community, including schools in the Fleetwood school partnership. We will share our outcomes with our school advisor and we would aim to offer our improved expertise to help develop other schools who need support in the area of language learning. \r\n\r\nThe potential long term benefits for the children from forming this project mean that they leave school with enthusiasm and a desire for life long learning and language competency.

Family aspirations are low and there is a lack of opportunities provided by families for our pupils. Staff audits were done when the new MFL Coordinator took on her role to gather an understanding of the provision of languages across the school. Needs were identified and research began to find a project that would address the needs and aid the school in moving forward with language learning. The needs and objectives of the project are as follows: Develop staff confidence and competence in teaching the 4 core stands of language learning - listening, speaking, reading and writing. Ensure that internationalism and learning about other cultures in evident across our school, not only in stand-alone lessons, but in everyday situations. Make language learning purposeful for our childrenIncrease motivation, enjoyment and self-esteem in language learning for both staff and pupils. The school plans to send eight members of staff on an immersion course in France over a two year period. Each participant will go with different aims in mind and on return disseminate the knowledge and skills learned to their colleagues. They will return with a bank of resources to then be shared and used to improve practice. Partnerships with a link school in France will be built between both staff and pupils. Whilst in France, participants will attend ability-grouped language classes to develop their competence in speaking the language. They will be given opportunities to experience the French culture and gather resources to share with the pupils and their colleagues. By the end of the project, cultural diversity will be evident in both KS2 and KS1 with pupils who are more aware of internationalism and cultures other than their own. Our pupils will be more aware of the opportunities available to them. Staff will be more equipped to meet the expectations of the National Curriculum and support pupils in their language learning. The school will see an increase in motivation and enthusiasm within both staff and pupils.
