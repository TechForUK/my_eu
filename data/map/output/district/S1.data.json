Over 50% of expenditure in the EU construction sector is on repair of existing structures rather than on new build. The primary material of construction requiring repair in EU is concrete. The annual cost of repair of reinforced concrete structures in Western Europe is in excess of \u20ac5 billion, a problem which is likely to be even greater in Eastern Europe. Wide scale research undertaken by EU FP5 project CONREPNET 2004 showed that 25% of structure owners are unhappy with the performance of the repair within five years after the rehabilitation of reinforced concrete structures; 75% are dissatisfied within ten years. This has generated a requirement to deliver more durable and effective repairs to concrete structures. To meet this requirement, this MCure project will scientifically develop a novel accelerated curing approach which will improve the durability, accelerate the curing and consistency of concrete repairs, independent of climatic environment. It will be an energy and time efficient curing system. It will make more efficient use of resources, especially in harsh winter weather conditions due to the system robustness and the effectiveness of the technology in all kinds of weather. This approach will improve the productivity and competitiveness of SME repairs contractors. This technological approach will involve advancements in the fields of remote moisture sensing and concrete compressive strength. Background research has validated the technical concept and the market opportunity. Within five post project years, MCure will generate at least 215 new jobs in EU and additional revenues of over\u20ac28 million for the SMEPs.", 1752.0, 1311624.0, "MCURE", "More durable repairs of concrete structures", "More than half of EU expenditures in the construction sector are on repair of existing structures, most commonly those made of reinforced concrete.

While the construction sector is a pillar of the EU economy, it also represents about 40\u00a0% of its total energy consumption and generates about one third of all greenhouse gases in Europe.\n\nA new energy-efficient system for accelerated curing during repair of concrete structures is being developed with EU support of the http://www.mcure-fp7.eu/ (MCURE) project. It will be applicable in all environmental conditions, including harsh winters in northern climates.\n\nMCURE promises to address all sides of the multi-faceted problem. The system will improve repair performance while decreasing energy consumption and reducing capital and maintenance costs. Overall, it will also enhance the productivity and competitive position of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) doing the repairs.\n\nLab-scale investigations have been carried out on cube samples of various volumes using microwave powers of varying intensities leading to definition of optimum process parameters. Preliminary results demonstrate the ability of the system to outperform current state-of-the-art concrete curing techniques. The two most important measures are temperature and moisture. Researchers are now developing selected moisture measurement techniques after a thorough literature search and in-depth discussions.\n\nA team of scientists and engineers is designing the MCURE prototype that will exploit an optimum energy coupling mechanism and a driving system to repair materials. The finalised optimal curing system design has been determined based on process requirements and the microwave transmission system specifications supported by simulation work.\n\nDuring the next reporting period, the prototype will be manufactured and tested on a variety of samples in order to optimise it for specific applications.

The risk that a small quantity of an explosive, below the threshold of the detection instruments, could get undetected should be considered, and the introduction of contermeasures to reduce the effects of on-board explosions should be considered.  This is the idea behind FLY-BAG.

The issue of containing explosions aboard narrow-body aircraft must be resolved.  Our concept is based on the development of flexible textile-based luggage containers able to resist a small to medium explosion by controlled expansion and containment of the shock waves whilst, at the same time, preventing hard luggage fragment projectiles (shrapnel) from striking the main structure of the aircraft at high speed.  A multi-layered 'soft-sandwich' structure is required to absorb the large dynamic loads of the explosion and the large deformation related to the gas expansion. Our idea is to use a multi-axial textile structures made of ballistic yarns as an internal high strength layer, coupled with an external 'foldable' layer which could deform in a controlled way during the explosion, in a way similar to air-bags in cars.

This year 10 industrial clerks of the bilingual class in their second year of training will have the unique opportunity of doing a training section in Cork, Ireland for 3 months. Based on the positive experience of the pilot phase in 2013 during which 4 industrial clerks had spent two months in Cork under the leadership of the Irish agency Green Horizons, we felt encouraged  to bring this new project on the way. The Chamber of Commerce in Dortmund supports this long-term stay in all areas and welcomes the additional title of ' Industrial clerk EU '. This title enables participants to acquire a significant professional qualification for the global labour market and will be validated in accordance with ECVET-elements. The stay is provided from 29.08.2014 - 21.11.2014 .\r\n\r\nDue to the long-standing European activities further EU projects have been developed:\r\n- For 5 years there has been a Skype-Project with our Dutch partner in Waalwijk. Here, two German and two Dutch students act as founders of a fictitious company. The bilateral development and presentation of these business ideas is done in English. Technical support is offered by the IT department of the district of Unna.\r\n- Currently we are playing an active part in an innovative Comenius Regio project (2012-2014) together with our Polish partner in Nowy Sacz. This projects aims at the development and training of cross-culturally competent employees.\r\n- Due to the numerous stays abroad, a significant increase in the number of participants in the voluntary English tests (KMK - tests) could be detected.\r\n\r\nOverall, the implementation of these EU projects has significantly contributed to improved co-operation between local and foreign companies , the district of Unna and the Hansa vocational college.

Almost all children in Sjumilaskolan have a different mother tongue than Swedish. In North Biskopsg\u00e5rden there is high unemployment, concern with violence, drugs and gang crime and low achievement in school. In recent years, the unrest in the region has increased and a large number of shootings, some fatal, have occurred in the school's neighborhood. Today the average merit rating is 165.8 and the proportion of pupils achieving the goals in all subjects is 39.1%. In four years the school has had four principals, which indicates a high staff turnover.\r\n\r\nParticipants: This project has a total of eight participants. The participants are two principals, two teachers and four tutors/mentors/coaches who all work on and with Sjumilaskolan.\r\n\r\nActivities: Participants will engage in a so-called job shadowing to learn from the receiving country's skills and methods to support teachers in underprivileged families and schools. There will also be workshops to initiate an active dialogue and exchange of knowledge between guest and host participants. \r\n\r\nMethod: We use observations, structured reflection, individually and in groups and workshops.\r\nExpected results and impact goals: Through the international exchange, we want to get new tools to support and motivate staff at Sjumilaskolan, and provide increased competence in part responding to students' differences. Continuity as a remaining staff would provide, we see as an important part of creating a peaceful and safe workplace for students where learning is the focus. In time, we hope that this will lead to better school performance, fewer students who deviate from the studies and a higher proportion of students receiving high school eligibility. Research suggests that early school dropout significantly increases the risk of future social vulnerability. Something that should be seen as alarming in an area with already high unemployment and criminal gangs. In the short term, the project aims to increase the individual teacher and the college expertise in meeting pupils' differences and to promote good learning experience for the students, despite many external difficulties.

We realize that people destroy their bodies while falling into extremes by blindly following the ideals of beauty straight from the covers of magazines or alternatively consuming empty calories daily.Fast food, the lack of exercise and the overuse of substances causes the population health to deteriorate steadily, while life expectancy continues to fall. If nothing changes, people are more likely to get sick and die more quicker than a decade ago. In a couple of years, today's youth will be much more sickly than their parents, unless there will be a fundamental transformation of the current lifestyles.Faced with the threats that await us we decided to act because we wish to implement a project that will increase awareness of the impact of nutrition and physical activity on health.The goals that we have set are:- To familiarize participants with the concept of health and a healthy lifestyle;- Inceasing knowledge through the analysis of ones way of life and its impact on the health in the present and future;- Deepening the knowledge of the participants in planning changes in their lifestyles that bring beneficial changes to their health;- Increasing awarness of lifestyle diseases and their prevention- Increasing awareness of the different philosophies in life.

In an European context, as well as in a national context , bullying occurs in increasingly atrocious ways, such as: street fights, bombings, insults, harassment, cyberbullying. The project will be one with a great impact for the 33 participants, because they will have the opportunity to work at an European level by interacting with concrete life situations through thematic visits to accredited institutions in order to fight against bullying.Statistics show that a total of 3417 students in Poland and 5626 in Lithuania were surveyed, showing that 30.1% adolescents in Poland and 52.3% in Lithuania have reported being a victim. Bullying being associated with poor subjective health and low life satisfaction. In Greece 55% of students are claiming that they are suffering from depression because of bullying. As many as one in three children have self harmed or had suicidal thoughts. The research conducted by the University Research Institute of Mental Health (EPIPSI) concludes that bullying is spreading like an epidemic, 8.5% of teenagers are being bullied at least 2-3 times a month, while 1 in 6 (15.8 %) teens mention that they intimidate others frequently. Students who bully others are mostly boys, while those who are intimidated are both boys and girls.In the United Kingdom, 50% of young people have bullied another person, 30% of which do it at least once a week,74% of those who have been bullied, have, at some point been physically attacked, 17% have been sexually assaulted whereas 62% have been cyber bullied.In Turkey, statistics show that almost  33,5% of young people have been bullied verbally, 35.5% have been bullied physically, 28.3% have been bullied emotionally, and 15.6%  had been sexually bullied, at least once during the academic year. In Bulgaria, different studies show that between 70% and 80% of the students admit that in their school there were cases of aggression and they have witnessed them; 38% of the children confess they have participated in acts of bullying in school, 30% on the street; 23% of the students have used Internet to harass their friends; Romania is among the top three European countries in the incidence of cyber bullying, between October 2011- October 2013, there have been registered over 2907 cases of bullying. 45,72 \u2105 regarding physical violence, 22,86\u2105 verbal abuse, whereas 15,24 and 14,28\u2105 regarding emotional abuseThe methods of non-formal learning will blend harmoniously with the informal learning points of maximum intensity, such as: Theatre of the oppressed, flash mob, photovoice, collective street painting,  all this being of maximum impact on the participants even more since some of them know them just from hearsay, never being directly involved.All the above mentioned activities will achieve the project objectives: create resources for youth workers, in order to help young people who have been bullied adapt and reflect on their own and others behaviour through videos and testimonials; provide useful information by organizing workshops; exchange experiences and best practices  concerning  youth activities that  promote the integration of the young people that suffered from being bullied ; familiarize the participants with different tools and methods of non-formal education for young people that face social adjustment problems ;  personal and professional development; promote the  intercultural dialogue;  Create and develop new projects and partnerships with the main theme being the  inclusion and social integration of young victims of bullying in Romania and Europe;familiarize the participants with the Erasmus + Programme,raise awareness concerning harassed persons in all life sectors; fight against stereotypes, prejudices and discriminations ; promote tolerance on a large scale including among disabled persons, as well as to, promote human dignity and respect.The activities of the project suppose : conference, seminars, debats, thematic visits, open discussions, workshops, reflexions , meetings with specialists in the fild of bullying and specialoists in social integrations for youngsters.The project aims to change attitudes and thoughts, and because of this, the impact of the mobility in Romania will be on a large scale among foreign partners and collaborators from Romania.All the good practices of the project will be posted on the facebook group, partner sites, profile sites, representing a DVD that will be accessible to all those interested.

Today, one of the most important problems faced by the refugees living in other countries is access to the education. In total, Human Rights Watch indicates in its report that there are 3 000 0000 Syrian children who cannot go to school.

Because of their current situation, the best way for their integration is through the non-formal learning methods, where through interactive activities they will socialize with other people, will learn new things and will learn the language of the country. \r\nAlso, various researchers have shown that if people have positive and enriching experiences with other cultures than they are more likely to embrace diversity.

D-TRANSFORM intends to produce recommendations on various aspects of a university strategy based on the use of digital tools. The following questions will be addressed: (i) the role of MOOCs in enhancing competitiveness, international attractiveness and in strengthening the identity of universities; but (ii) also the possible disruptions that they may cause in the educational process and the educational body, and the solutions to be applied; (iii) the benefits in resource sharing capacity versus the need for \u201ccontextualization\u201d (by providing a \u201cprivate space\u201d within the MOOC \u201cpublic space\u201d); (iv) the necessary balance between online and face-to-face learning; and finally (v) the economic aspects (business models, cost-effectiveness, public and private funding opportunities).\r\n\r\nBased on these recommendations, D-TRANSFORM will set up two \u201cleadership schools\u201d, dedicated, for the 1st time in Europe, to the university governances.

The target group (over 55 years and not digitally literate) typically consists of individuals who have reached an advanced stage in their lives without learning to use any digital technology. Our approach will use touch-table games to introduce such individuals to digital interaction that provides confidence motivation and skills that can subsequently support exploratory-based learning of other digital technologies.  The approach will be to pilot and validate a new approach to learning digital skills that targets affective barriers to technology adoption as well as the cognitive and physical process of learning and skill acquisition.  Progression from initial exploration of a table-top application through the practical comprehension of system principles  to automatic competence and full literacy can be achieved through a combination of playful exploration and light guidance through engagement with games.   Players motivated to engage with games are effectively engaging in incremental learning about, for example, the behaviour of digital objects, the principles of object and area selection and the relationship between analogue metaphors and degrees of movement on digital space.  Helping and persuading participants to overcome reluctance is a priority as facilitating the cognitive progress of learning, and the playability, engagement and sociality of games is key to this strategy.    The use of the social dimension weakens resistance to educational activities that learners may be reluctant to engage in.  For older users this includes reversing a social stigma when contemplating digital technologies (where there is a sense of disenfranchisement, a sense that it is not \u2018their\u2019 technology).  The overlay of a sense of social activity through gaming is likely to produce behaviour change.  The mission of organisations such as The  UK and numerous regional online centres in the UK is to provide an environment that supports a positive approach to technology, as well as more instrumental help in overcoming difficulties.A threshold of 210 users and 35 individuals engaged in mentoring users in day centre environments will take part in two round of studies using touch-table games, followed by longitudinal monitoring of their progression to use of a wider range of digital utilities, principally using tablets. This will lead to the generation of a best-practice guide for promoting the approach to inspiring digital adoption for older users. This will disseminated in the three partner countries and trans-nationally through organizations concerned with promoting digital adoption for excluded citizens.The EU acknowledges the need for every citizen to have at least basic digital skills in order to participate in the modern society. Although the percentage of people online has increased rapidly in recent years we are now faced with the fact that there remains a percentage of people who for a combination of reasons are harder to reach and more difficult to provide with digital skills. Acquiring initial digital literacy involves learning basic manipulations, translating thoughts and intentions into specific input actions.  This is a skill that is learned through adoption, exploration and repeated practice.  The WIMP interfaces that are typical of the second generation of interactive systems have proved difficult to learn for many citizens.  Therefore our approach is to provide pathways to digital literacy that has playful and social interaction as a key first phase.  The gentle introduction gradually encourages exploratory learning of tools such as social network and communication, and more task-based applications such as e-mail, form filling and manipulating security features.  This may be by transferring learned and practiced competence not interaction with tablets (in order to exploit touch and manipulation skill acquired through game play).   This segmentation of the learning process allows the acquisition of key interaction and exploratory-learning skills based on ludic engagement. This will build up digital confidence and familiarity with touch interfaces, and removes the stigma associated with digital technology, using ludic engagement to positively reinforce familiarity and confidence the technology.  Furthermore it helps to redefine the role of those who are charged with mentoring and helping those individuals, by redefining the nature of learning.  It is anticipated that the work will disseminate best-practice through its relationships with practitioner organizations established at EU level and in three of the partner countries (UK, Austria, Slovenia) where organizations targeting wider digital participation already exist.

Our International Security Management Knowledge Alliance (ISM-KA) addresses this issue by creating sustainable and concrete resources and structures to foster international security collaborations. Deliverables will be horizon scanning for security threats/development, an exchange/knowledge platform for public and private security experts and the creation of a multi-disciplinary, sectoral based accredited MSc, and MOOC\u2019s for outreach to the wider public. Guiding principles are multi-stakeholder involvement, evidence-based management, co-creation, international perspective and policy-practice alignment. With this we will establish an international learning, teaching and knowledge-sharing environment, which contributes to the development and professionalization of leadership, innovation and operational proficiency in the field of international safety and security.The consortium consists of partners from higher education, private industry, law enforcement, municipalities, and NGO\u2019s. The partners have extensive expertise in the design and implementation of training programs in the field of international safety and security working with and employing safety and security professionals from the operational to the strategic level.

This is a significant gap in the evidence base.The project addresses this gap through a multi-disciplinary approach involving world leading academic institutions, both central and local government agencies, federations & practical deliverers, to ensure its credibility in development and practicability in delivery.The project is delivered through a 4 stage sequential and logical approach:Stage 1: A systematic review will be undertaken of studies and projects that have examined the social benefits accrued from outdoor sports across Europe. These include but are not limited to: social inclusion, community cohesion, health and well-being, volunteer engagement, environmental awareness and education, educational motivation and self-esteem. This will provide a useful stand alone resource.Stage 2: Information gathered from Stage 1 will be used to develop the agreed formula for the calculation of the value of social benefits along with a clear methodology for practical application.These 2 stages will be led by key academic institutes that have specific expertise in systematic reviews and developing economic modeling associated with social return on investment.Stage 3: The methodology will be tested in practical projects across Europe to ensure its practical application.
