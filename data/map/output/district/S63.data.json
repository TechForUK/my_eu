Original predictions over the longevity of constructed wetlands were approximately 50 -100 years (Conley et al 1991).  However, it has become disappointingly apparent that these systems are clogging and have on average a lifetime of less than 10 years (Griffin et al 2008). Currently when a wetland becomes clogged, the whole site has to be refurbished and the reeds regrown, which takes several years and has significant economic consequences for the operators.\n\nOur project ARBI aims to develop and trial an Autonomous Reed Bed Installation containing a magnetic resonance probe, can be deployed in several locations within a wetland to give measurements at different depths.  By measuring the relaxation times of MR, sufficient information can be obtained to determine the clog state of the gravel bed of a wetland. This would enable the operators to isolate those areas of the bed where the problem resides and make a partial intervention, without the need to remove and re-plant the whole reed bed. When the system is  developed, we will have potential for application in other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows like: slow rate sand filters, and river bank filtration.\n\nThe project will have major benefits for those organisations who would like to install reedbeds but  have resisted doing because of concerns over performance and maintenance costs.  These will increase the potential size of the market for reedbed installers and benefit the SMEs in the consortium who currently are operating in a constrained market which has not achieved its true potential.", 143357.0, 1203108.0, "ARBI", "Improving reed bed water treatment", "A green technology that uses reed beds to treat wastewater is receiving a major boost thanks to an EU initiative extending the system's working life.", "There are over 12\u00a0000 constructed wetlands across Europe, which are used to further treat wastewater that has already been passed through water treatment plants. The wetlands usually comprise a gravel bed planted with reeds through which the wastewater passes and is purified by biofilms of microorganisms living on the gravel's surface.\n\nOriginal predictions for the working life of constructed wetlands were 50-100 years. However, because the gravel becomes clogged, this figure has been drastically revised to an average lifetime of less than 10 years. Furthermore, refurbishing the system is both time consuming and expensive, and disrupts the water treatment process.\n\nThe EU-funded project http://www.arbi-eu.com/ (ARBI) (Autonomous reed bed installations) is developing a system containing magnetic resonance sensors, which give prior warning of clogging. The probes can provide measurements of the clog state of the gravel bed at different depths, enabling the problem to be isolated and speedily dealt with. This means that the entire reed bed does not need to be removed and replanted.\n\nARBI will be a modular system that offers a step change in constructed wetland technology, supplying an off-the-shelf solution. This can be easily tailored to customers' needs with regard to treatment volume and contaminant level by simply using multiple modules.\n\nThe system monitors clogging and helps maintain optimal conditions with minimal need for human intervention. Once it is successfully developed, it could be applied to other water treatment systems based on subsurface flows. These include slow-rate sand filters and river bank filtration.\n\nARBI will benefit those organisations that wish to install reed beds for water treatment, but were discouraged by concerns over cost and performance. It will therefore enable environmentally friendly constructed wetland treatments to be used far more widely than previously thought possible.", null, "http://www.lightmain.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-07/159212.jpg", "fp7_109925_951897085"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7EW", "EUC Syd rejser og l\u00e6rer", "B&E Together Ltd", 55758.0, "The project is an integrated part of the EUC Syd internationalization strategy whose primary objectives are based on the EU 's great ideas on freedom of movement so that participants in mobilities get a realization of the European labor market as their future labor market and not only the national labor market.

They mainly originate from the business area of wholesale, logistics, IT and industry. Their German companies usually support only the three-week-period; that is why there are two options \u2013 trainees can choose between the short-term (three-week) or long-term (3- month) stay abroad.\r\nThe long-term stay in Ireland is a further development of the short-term projects. \r\nThe participants\u2019 number is 13 and all of them are doing a traineeship to become an industrial clerk. Many months ahead of the actual stay in Ireland the German companies are informed about the organisational requirements. The Chamber of Commerce (IHK) in Dortmund supports this work placement in all areas. The implementation of the project is done by the agency Green Horizons, which offers impeccable organisational skills.\r\n\r\nLongterm effects:\r\nParticipants receive the Europass which offers a major plus for their applications. At the same time they acquire the competence of basically taking a look beyond the fence. The unique opportunity of gaining work experience abroad serves as an incentive for transferring and expanding business knowledge to the host company - at the same time the participants might feel inclined to take up business studies abroad or going abroad for work.

Indeed, crafts and companies are now dealing with international exchanges and facing a multinational competition. Qualifications and skills are therefore put into question. In order to contribute to this expansion, it is primordial to provide each apprentice with the possibility to be trained and to work on a European level. It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and have performed to value on-the-job learning and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and knowledge transmissions. Long term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. It is part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d to have a one-year experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 5860 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.Since 2004, almost 14100 apprentices have therefore benefitted from a 3 week mobility project in European Union, with 22 countries, owing to our trusted partners. Our experience now allows us to choose our best partners to provide our apprentices quality trainings in any of our 29 trades (industry, construction, building, baking, leather and textiles trades). For 2016-2018, we wish to send again more than 1000 apprentices in gathered mobility projects together with their class and their trade teacher (77 teachers in total), 140 apprentices for a long term (one year), 105 apprentices in a technical training for 2 weeks and 6 trainers for job-shadowing.In September 2009 we managed to officially join in the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract the 3 week mobility project abroad for all our level 4 apprentices. The enhancement of the quality of our project is owing to the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest a precise programme compatible with our apprentices\u2019 modules in France, with the specificities of the host country. This approach brings a value to our programmes in France and comforts the employers of our apprentices, worried about this mobility project abroad of their employee. The project will allow our participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills. Indeed, apprenticeship and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop its adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. Our partners involved in our projects are training organizations, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organisms in 22 countries.

This may initially sound easy. However, there is much to be in place for pupils, parents, teaching staff and school administration before such work practices can be referred to as successful.  Partner organizations have to prepare to receive a Norwegian student. They must assess tasks in their own companies and match them to learning objectives our students bring with their curriculum. Students prepares for the learning objectives for their own program, and finding out which type of exercises are expected to perform during their period abroad. Teachers facilitate and help students in order for them to be able to learn the most, and thereby help them to match the learning objectives and defining achievement.\r\n\r\nPrior to traveling, students attend preparatory meetings. The focus is society and culture. Through the these meetings we prepare students on what to expect and what it means to be a \u201cworld Citizen\u201d.

Through training trust through new collaborators, testing the ability to care for each other and for new friends, students and teachers alike strengthen their ability to thrive, and feel more confident that they can thrive in unfamiliar situations. Consequently, the students become more aware of their own ability to master situations which they are sure to meet in their working life\"\r\n\r\nTo uphold the secure environment for learning our school always send accompanying persons to all destinations.

Ainsi, chaque ann\u00e9e, nous souhaitons permettre \u00e0 plus de 1000 apprentis de partir en mobilit\u00e9 group\u00e9e de 3 semaines, syst\u00e9matiquement accompagn\u00e9s de leur formateur m\u00e9tier (95 au total) ; soutenir plus de 150 jeunes dans le cadre d\u2019une mobilit\u00e9 individuelle d\u2019un an en Europe ; favoriser la mobilit\u00e9 longue des apprentis en permettant \u00e0 au moins 18 d\u2019entre eux de partir de 6 \u00e0 12 mois cons\u00e9cutifs \u2013 en conservant la logique d\u2019alternance dans le pays d\u2019accueil; mettre en place 8 stages techniques de 2 semaines pour un total 112 jeunes et organiser a minima une mission d\u2019observation par an \u00e9galement.\r\n\r\nPour mener \u00e0 bien ces actions, Les Compagnons du Devoir s\u2019inscrivent dans une d\u00e9marche d\u2019am\u00e9lioration continue et s\u2019appuient sur le processus qualit\u00e9 mis en place dans le cadre de la certification ISO 9001 obtenue en 2016. \r\n\r\nL'am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 des mobilit\u00e9s se retrouve alors dans l\u2019accompagnement propos\u00e9 par nos partenaires, avec un programme permettant \u00e0 nos jeunes de travailler un projet p\u00e9dagogique pr\u00e9cis, en lien avec leur formation et en ad\u00e9quation avec les particularit\u00e9s du pays d'accueil. Cette approche garantie la pertinence de nos actions et rassure les employeurs de nos jeunes, soucieux de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019une mobilit\u00e9 hors France.\r\n\r\nDe plus, ses actions de mobilit\u00e9 permettront, \u00e0 celles et ceux qui en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront, d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir des comp\u00e9tences m\u00e9tiers, linguistiques, interculturelles et transversales puisque le mode d\u2019apprentissage et la sectorisation des m\u00e9tiers diff\u00e8rent selon les pays. Voyager, c\u2019est \u00e9galement pouvoir d\u00e9velopper ses facult\u00e9s d\u2019adaptabilit\u00e9, qualit\u00e9 requise pour une meilleure employabilit\u00e9 et \u00e9panouissement de nos jeunes. \r\n\r\nLes partenaires impliqu\u00e9s sont des organismes de formation, des entreprises, des partenaires sociaux, des chambres consulaires et des organismes interm\u00e9diaires r\u00e9partis dans 21 pays. La mobilit\u00e9 \u00e9tant de plus en plus reconnue, grand nombre de nos placements se reconduisent d\u2019une ann\u00e9e sur l\u2019autre. La fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 des partenaires, permet alors d\u2019organiser les actions en toute confiance et de pr\u00e9parer au mieux chaque jeune. \r\n\r\nLes comp\u00e9tences travaill\u00e9es ou acquises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger seront valid\u00e9es et r\u00e9pertori\u00e9es sur notre plateforme p\u00e9dagogique accessible en ligne \u00ab Aquisav \u00bb. Nous esp\u00e9rons \u00e9galement que notre participation \u00e0 des projets pilote tels que la mobilit\u00e9 longue des apprentis permettra de mieux appr\u00e9hender la d\u00e9marche ECVET et de la mettre en application. Dans cette perspective, nos partenaires ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 tous sign\u00e9 des accords de partenariats (MoU).\r\n\r\nDans le cadre de ce projet, le service international aura notamment pour charge d\u2019entretenir les relations entre les partenaires, de pr\u00e9parer et de coordonner le suivi et la validation des parcours.

In addition, we target our efforts to support those who now have fewer opportunities due to their backgrounds such as their mental health issues or offending backgrounds.\r\n\r\nWe will support 16 participants over a 12-month period to take part in a work placement opportunity on a care farm in France. The project is called The WOLF Project (Working Outside @ L'Omelette Ferme), because we know having the opportunity to work in this environment provides participants with a great sense of achievement. While on placement the participants will be able to take part in all aspects of running and managing the farm and they will be able to gain new skills, knowledge as well as building confidence and feelings of self-worth and will directly feed into their accredited vocational qualification and professional development. \r\n\r\nThe working programme provided during each work placement includes but is not limited to: \r\n - Developing Business and Administration skills.\r\n - Practical Small Holding Skills - animal care, practical food production (crop and animal, including butchery).\r\n - Sustainable Living - solar powered hot water, fire wood production for heating and food production, sustainable forestry.\r\n - Maintenance Techniques - animal fencing, dry stone walling, animal housing both maintenance and repair.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the skills, and knowledge gained on the farm each participant will be able to take part in accredited training.

This may initially sound easy. However, there is much to be in place for pupils, parents, teaching staff and school administration before such work practices can be referred to as successful.  Partner organizations have to prepare to receive a Norwegian student. They must assess tasks in their own companies and match them to learning objectives our students bring with their curriculum. Students prepares for the learning objectives for their own program, and finding out which type of exercises are expected to perform during their period abroad. Teachers facilitate and help students in order for them to be able to learn the most, and thereby help them to match the learning objectives and defining achievement.\r\n\r\nPrior to traveling, students attend preparatory meetings. The focus is society and culture. Through the these meetings we prepare students on what to expect and what it means to be a \u201cworld Citizen\u201d. We also try to give them an insight to the fact that the world increasingly becomes smaller.\r\n\r\nThe school hopes to observe that internationalization makes a difference in school choice among youth. There is a need to recruit for vocational subjects, and particularly some subjects have been more affected than others have. The mobilities in itself is an activity to encourage recruitment to our program areas, and not least to motivate students to complete their vocational education. \r\nThe upcoming period of mobilities holds new partners in France and in Italy. We carefully  follow the development for the programmes of  resturant and food processing (France) and Design and Textile (Italy). We are eager to see how our cooperation will develop, and not least to see the experiences and learning outcomes the pupils will have.\r\n\r\nDocumentation of learning outcomes is important and is an ongoing development in all departments. Using ECVET documents will become easier for more teachers as this is a focus in the field. The work is time-consuming and it is expected development in the coming years.\r\n\r\nThe school's European development plan \"PROUD\" says:\r\n\"Students thrive through feeling secure, trusting each other and caring for each other \u2013 through internationalisation, confidence is tested, both for the individual student and for the staff members who travels along: new destinations, new collaborators and colleagues and new companies. Through training trust through new collaborators, testing the ability to care for each other and for new friends, students and teachers alike strengthen their ability to thrive, and feel more confident that they can thrive in unfamiliar situations. Consequently, the students become more aware of their own ability to master situations which they are sure to meet in their working life\"\r\n\r\nTo uphold the secure environment for learning our school always send accompanying persons to all destinations. Our students are aged 17 to 19 when they leave, and they need the secure framwork we can offer. \r\n\r\nBorgund Vidareg\u00e5ande School is focused on quality.

Companies are now dealing with international exchanges and facing multinational competition. Qualifications and skills are therefore put into question. In order to contribute to this expansion, it is primordial to provide each apprentice with the possibility to be trained and to work on a European level. It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Les Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and make every effort to value on-the-job training and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and the sharing of knowledge. \r\n\r\nLong term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. Part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d syllabus gives the opportunity for our journeymen and journeywomen to have a one-year work experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 6700 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.\r\n\r\nWe have also had the opportunity to allow, since 2004, almost 16100 apprentices to benefit from a 3 week mobility project within the European Union, combining all trade sectors (industry, construction, baking, leather and textiles trades). \r\n\r\nIn order to institutionalize our actions, we manage to officially integrate the 3 week mobility project in to the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract for all our level 4 apprentices since 2009. \r\n\r\nFor 2018-2020, we would like to maintain this momentum and keep the objectives shared under our strategic development plan by sending again more than 1000 apprentices on group mobility projects together with their VET trainer (110 groups in total), 180 post-apprentices for a long term mobility (one year), 108 apprentices for 3-months to 9-months individual mobility \u2013sharing time between a company and a VET center in the host country, 60 post-apprentices on 2-week technical training courses and manage two different job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these actions Les Compagnons du Devoir are continually aiming to improve and since 2016 we have put in place our own quality management processes developed through the ISO 9001 certification. \r\n\r\nThe quality of our mobility projects relies greatly on the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest precise programs compatible with the apprentices\u2019 syllabus in France and with the specificities of the host country. This approach guarantees the relevance of our programs and reassures the employers of our apprentices, who could be concerned about the benefit of a mobility outside France.\r\nThese projects will allow the participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills as apprenticeships and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. \r\n\r\nOur partners involved in these projects are VET centers, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organizations in over 20 countries. Mobility is more and more recognized in these countries, therefore most work placements will be renewed year after year. \r\nYears of experience with our partners allows us to organize our projects with mutual trust and better prepare each participant for their mobility.\r\n\r\nEach participant\u2019s skills and competences gained abroad will be validated by the European partner and the French VET trainer on our online training platform \u201cAquisav\u201d. We also would like to use ECVET system. With this in mind, our partners have already signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). \r\n\r\nAs part of this project our International Department will maintain relationships with partners, prepare and coordinate the monitoring and the validation of each project. They will also help their VET centers, in France, with the practical organization of the mobility projects for apprentices (short-term and long-term) and support post-apprentices following technical training or going abroad for one year (individual mobility).\r\n\r\nThis ambitious project couldn\u2019t be organized without the considerable investment of VET centers, in particular our VET trainers and administrative teams.", "http://www.be-together.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA116-046192_19"]]}}, "outwardCode": "S63"}
