One of the key production processes in high labour cost areas such as Europe is assembly of final products in sectors such as automotive, aerospace, pharmaceutical and medical industries. They all require systems that can: be installed quickly, achieve high volumes at shorter time intervals, perform with minimum interruptions and be reconfigured for new products with minimum cost.\nPRIME aims to create new solutions for deployment by SMEs of highly adaptive, reconfigurable self-aware plug and produce assembly systems, which will use multi-agent control, dynamic knowledge sharing, integrated monitoring, and innovative human-machine interaction mechanisms. These next generation assembly systems equipped with PRIME technology will be able to proactively support rapid reconfiguration, adaptation, error-recovery, and operational performance improvement. This will lead to a dramatic cost and time reduction of deploying and maintaining complex assembly systems on demand and improve their effectiveness.\nThe PRIME vision will be achieved by enhancing today\u2019s assembly systems with standardised plug and produce process and control solutions and interfaces to allow rapid reconfiguration and deployment, performance monitoring, self-awareness and evolutionary system adaptation. Based on this, the overall system performance will be monitored against production objectives and bottlenecks, thus errors and sub-optimal behaviour can be identified and assigned to the responsible stations. This will enable optimisation and adaptation of the assembly processes and associated system behaviour within a human centred environment.

One of our school aims is to develop our European dimension to the curriculum and to make bilingualism a cornerstone of our school ethos. Currently, Spanish is the modern foreign language taught by an external Spanish teacher. All staff were audited by the SLT on their confidence with speaking, reading, writing and teaching Spanish. The results showed that all KS2 staff feel incapable of teaching Spanish and are worried about teaching it in September 2014 when it becomes compulsory. They were mostly concerned about their lack of understanding of language and also their lack of knowledge of innovative methodology. \r\n\r\nWe aim to equip all KS2 teachers with enough knowledge and skills in Spanish language teaching to enable them to teach a rich and varied Spanish curriculum. This will eliminate the need to use an external Spanish teacher and will ensure that a high standard of modern foreign language teaching is achieved throughout the key stage. We also aim to ensure that all of our children leave our school with a wider and deeper understanding of Spanish. To do this, we will embed Spanish in every day school life for all children. This includes displaying and using vocabulary for common and classroom items; greeting each other and engaging in conversations and counting in Spanish. Another aim is to improve the day-to-day running and management of our school with a view to becoming more of a 'learning community' as is the norm with our European partners. \r\n\r\n10 members of staff will be engaged in the mobilities across a period of two years. This is  mix of classroom teachers from Foundation Stage, Key Stage One and Key Stage Two and members of the Senior Leadership Team. They will be able to attend language and methodology training in Spain which will enable them to be immersed in the language. Currently, they feel underconfident and incompetent when it comes to teaching Spanish and also have little knowledge of culture in Spain. All teachers are very enthusiastic about taking part in the mobilities. They have seen the positive impact it has already had on two of our staff. They are keen to develop their language for their personal and professional development and are keen to take ownership of the Spanish curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe mobilities will consist of half term trips to Spain to engage in immersion courses in Spanish language. The institute will also conduct lessons in the methodology and pedagogy of teaching a modern foreign language. Teachers will have the opportunity to consolidate their understanding of both language and teaching methods during the language course. The members of SLT will also be able to learn about the day-to-day running of the school and management techniques during time spent in school as part of the language course. \r\n\r\nWe expect the project to have a measurable positive impact on the development of all of our children's ability to read, write and speak Spanish. In the short term, we expect children to become more interested and engaged with Spanish (as a direct result of a renewed interest in the subject in teaching staff) and to be more confident to 'have a go'. Longer term, we expect the current year two children to leave our school at the end with a much deeper and wider understanding of Spanish language and culture than previous years. We also hope to make transition into secondary language education much smoother which will make the children much more successful in their language education and potential careers. All KS2 staff should become much more confident and able to plan and teach their own Spanish lessons rather than having to rely on an external teachers.

It serves a community in a working-class neighbourhood which was traditionally a fishing village but which has grown to become both a densely populated urban area as well as a destination for students and tourists attracted to its beaches and climate. The school offers all stages of education (Pre-Primary, Primary, Secondary and Baccalaureate) and has approximately 800 students ranging from 3 to 18 years old. The school is funded by the state in its Pre-Primary, Primary and Secondary sections, while the last two years (Baccalaureate) are funded privately. La Presentaci\u00f3n is currently in the process of implementing a bilingual education program in Spanish and English: it currently covers five grades (from Pre-Primary to Year 2 of Primary School), and will eventually grow to include all stages of education at our school. In Primary School, English is a mandatory subject and is considered a core part of the curriculum.These considerations, combined with the fact that we live in an increasingly globalized and interconnected society, highlight our school's need to improve our staff's proficiency in English and develop their teaching skills in innovative methodologies, while using technology as an essential part of their training. At the same time, we want our students to develop critical thinking skills, build teamworking skills and adopt essential ethical values that facilitate peaceful coexistence in a free democratic society.Through this project we aim to provide 7 staff members with the necessary training to meet our objectives, which can be divided into three main points. First of all, to break down language barriers with other countries by providing language training. Second of all, to give them the chance to observe the good practices in innovative teaching methodologies used in other countries and encourage them to put them into practice in their classrooms. Finally, to share their experience and desire to change with the rest of the teaching staff, since such enrichment experiences must not be limited to certain individuals but rather shared with the team in order to truly make changes which are effective, lasting and collective over the entire institution.Mobilitites are planned to have a duration of 8 days and are divided into 3 main activities: 2 structured courses (one in the United Kingdom and another in Finland), which will cover the need for English language training and exposure to innovative methodological practices; 1 activity involving the observation of good practice and 1 practice teaching activity in a foreign school.This project aims to have a positive impact on our students' learning on both a professional and personal level, as we work to provide them with the highest quality education possible.

It aims to help patients who present with a confluence of physical and/or psychological symptoms, and also to offer support to other specialties looking after these patients. Liaison psychiatry is well developed in the United Kingdom and operates on models incorporating multidisciplinary working with medical overview, but with nurses and other allied mental health professionals usually carrying out the majority of clinical work, and having important roles in leadership and management. In Greece, on the other hand, the subspecialty is currently developing against adverse economic circumstances, with provisions mainly comprising of small services offering ad-hoc medical input. Learning from UK Liaison Psychiatry is likely to result in better Liaison Psychiatry services in Greece, which would ultimately mean better patient care. The main aim is to train a group of mental health professionals from Greece in the way Liaison Psychiatry is practised in the United Kingdom. The main educational objectives are: a) for participants to advance their knowledge, skills and attitudes in liaison psychiatry, b) for participants to achieve an understanding of the role of management and leadership in liaison psychiatry, and specifically of their potential role as managers/leaders, c) for participants to understand the value and content of a set of professional attitudes that are necessary for the smooth running of a Liaison Psychiatry service.

It will  also substantiate the value and enhance their impact on the creative industries and even beyond.  In recent years there has been a rich reconsideration of the place of creative arts practice in research, addressing how practice can be understood as a method of research and how embodied arts and material thinking produces knowledge.  There has also been a growing number of doctorates completed through creative practice (which is variously called 'Artistic Research', 'Arts-based Research', 'Practice led Research'). However, dance and somatically informed performance, as a minority subject in many Universities, has received little direct attention in these discourses and frameworks and researchers in this field often work in isolating contexts with somewhat meagre infrastructure, networks, resources and channels to disseminate and support the work done.      ADiE seeks to address this gap by investigating practices and developing resources to support the significant developments in dance research that have the potential to reach beyond university frameworks to impact artistic innovation and the creative economy.The principal aim is to develop productive and meaningful provisions for PaR Doctorates that are suitable to the fluid, increasingly interdisciplinary and global, creative/research environments with which they intersect. Addressing the needs of research candidates, supervisors, universities and the creative industry the aim is to develop resources and guidelines that are directly relevant to the mobile nature of the creative industry and recognise the changing needs of the professional dance and performing arts sector. ADiE will therefore ensure that the rising number of artists entering into, and being nurtured by,  university environments receive the best possible support for their artistic/scholarly endeavors and are also well prepared to become our future leaders in the arts. ADiE asks: What are the expectations, perceptions and experiences of the Artistic Doctorate?What are the methodological tools and other training needs of artistic researchers in Dance and Performance?How are doctoral dissertations in artistic research best supervised and supported?How do doctoral studies through artistic research respond to, and prepare candidates for, the future?How might universities and creative partners better support artistic research doctorates and reflect the future needs of the creative industry and higher  education environments?  To address these questions ADiE will undertake four strands of work:1. Review the experiences/expectations of artistic doctoral candidates in different national contexts to identify best practices and gaps/ issues.2. Devise open educational resources / research training materials focusing in depth upon methodologies for artistic research in the public realm. 3. Develop guidelines that enable university & collaborative partners to better supervise and support the life cycle of Artistic Doctorates4.

This partnership will collaborate to undertake this comprehensive and in depth project that will bring wide ranging benefits. The partnership will in its first year investigate current provision and industry needs for creative practice doctorates in dance and performance in, and beyond, the partner countries. This assessment will enable the identification of common issues in provision and the relevance to creative industry.   In the second year we will develop much needed and innovative training materials, offer guidelines on effective support and supervision practices for PaR Doctorates and establish a rigorous shared support mechanism which will enable the dissemination of this good practice. Through the third year the transnational partnership will ensure that the latest developments and the best practices will be inculcated in common, across Europe and world-wide impacting upon regulations, policy and intersections with professional practice.

In the EC people may share their experiences, their strategies for coping with illness, social exclusion, disability. They will develop strategies to use these experiences as a resource. In the EC the experience of illness will no longer be regarded as a deficit, but as a resource. By accepting and valuing the life experience of the participants, they will get a new base for starting or continuing education.
