The consortium assembles 4 research performing SMEs with unique and complementary expertise, who will produce together a pre-series of 250 containers, obtain the relevant approvals from FAA/EASA, and deploy the solution with the pilot customers.\n\nThe project results, as compared with the current packaging, transport and security management methods, will be widely disseminated via industry associations such as IATA, TSA and TIACA. A full industrialization and commercialization plan will be developed in the course of the project.", 236880.0, 2749628.0, "CITRIMACC", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197910_952518467"]]}}, "outwardCode": "LA11"}
