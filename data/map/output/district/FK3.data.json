This adds value to the recycler, and provides manufacturers a rich source of useable recycled material at a local level. Our technology has the potential to make a major change in the way plastics are recycled across Europe. Every unit will reduce plastic to landfill by 2000/tonnes a year, helping Europe meet the EU goals for plastic recycling by 2020. \n\nJust 50 units operating across Europe will reduce the plastic going to landfill by one percent and create thousands of jobs throughout Europe in recycling, supply chain and manufacturing. \n\nPhase 1 will see Impact Laboratories undertake a feasibility assessment for introducing the technology across the European market. We will look at the supply chains, the needs of recyclers from different European countries and the needs of manufacturers throughout Europe to ensure the technology addresses their needs.\n\nImpact Laboratories will look to role the technology out by franchise or licence in phase 2, to allow European recyclers to reduce the plastic going to landfill.", 35835.0, 51194.0, "mixedplasticvalue", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_197425_936057664"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8AH", "SI Management of Falkirk Employment Action", "Falkirk Council", "Strategic Intervention management, administration and compliance.", "ESF", 135559.0, 338898.0, "esf_scotland_180"], ["8AH", "Falkirk Employment Action - Employability Pipeline", "Falkirk Council", "This Employability Pipeline will provide support to overcome barriers to work following the completion of the Falkirk Integrated Assessment; It will provide targeted support to help individuals with multiple barriers into employment.", "ESF", 1387940.0, 3469852.0, "esf_scotland_181"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FK3"}
