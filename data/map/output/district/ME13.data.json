We have an integrated Autism unit and more students with special educational needs than the national average. OFSTED noted in one report that we have 'some of the lowest rates of pupils...from different ethnic and religious backgrounds'. This is a unique challenge, leaving our students at risk of poor social mobility and social exclusion. This has led us to work hard to develop the international ethos of the school which has led us to be nationally recognised for our work, a case study for the British Council and winning awards. We want to increase engagement, motivate students towards lifelong learning, and reduce the number of students truanting or at risk from early school leaving. To do this we intend to continue with our student mobility projects. We have also started offering the new International Baccalaureate Careers Programme level 3 qualification. This is in a bid to make our Sixth Form offer more attractive to students that do not want to take a traditional academic pathway, are unsure about what they want to do after year 11, or are not ready or unable to find an apprenticeship. It is hoped that this will help to prevent early-school leaving and equip our students for the global marketplace. We need staff to be engaged with this international work as it is a holistic package that requires close cross-curricular work and represents a culture shift from the traditional qualifications staff are currently familiar with.\r\n\r\nSummary of the objectives of the project:\r\n-Strengthen multi-cultural education\r\n-To develop resources that explore the international dimension \r\n-To develop a range of pedagogical techniques in order to adapt to the changing educational landscape\r\n-Exchange best practices and new teaching methods\r\n-Encourage the students\u2019 personal learning and thinking skills\r\n-Improve and develop skills in the use of ICT\r\n-Develop group work capabilities \r\n-Develop the entrepreneurial and employability skills \r\n-Broaden the use of interdisciplinary studies\r\n-Increase the motivation to learn foreign languages\r\n-Attempt to introduce CLIM (cooperative learning in multicultural groups) into teaching methods\r\n-To develop a range of techniques in order to deal with sensitive cultural issues\r\n-To develop a range of techniques in order to combat drop out rates and engage pupils at risk of early school leaving. \r\n-Emphasize independent and lifelong learning.\r\n-Develop the International Baccalaureate Careers Programme.\r\n-Become an IB World School\r\n-Develop the training courses we already have on offer, and create new courses to disseminate our learning to our local partner schools as part of the Swale Teaching Alliance.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nUp to 27 members of staff that display the following through an application process - \r\n-Motivation and sensibility towards self development and implementing new and innovative methodology\r\n-Dedication to the aims, objectives and ambitions of the project\r\n-Ability and willingness to disseminate the experience and share best practice\r\n-A desire to gain experience, rejuvenate practice, address challenges, develop policy, become involved in the International Baccalaureate Careers Programme, or develop other curriculum or pastoral roles.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities:\r\nWithin school there will be whole staff meetings, training courses workshops and one-to-one support meetings available. Mobility activities include:\r\n-International Baccalaureate specific subject and coordinator training,\r\n-Networking conferences\r\n-Pedagogical conferences on innovative education; entrepreneurship, increasing engagement, mentoring vulnerable students, sharing best practice, ICT, social and emotional skills, inclusive education and broadening student horizons.\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project:\r\nThis project focuses on external courses that meet the project aims. It focuses on dissemination to ensure that the member of staff that benefits from the initial training shares this with staff. This will be done through our already robust training programme, and our strong connection to the Swale Teaching Alliance and Canterbury Christ Church University.\r\n\r\nResults, impact and longer term benefits:\r\n-Increase in pedagogical knowledge\r\n-More innovative methodology observed\r\n-Active engagement in the international ethos, holistic development of students and reducing early school leaving\r\n-Knowledge of other curricular structures and policies to increase reflective and critical practice\r\n-Increase in sharing best practice and cross-curricular work\r\n-Less students leaving school without employment, training, or further education arrangements\r\n-A diverse, engaging curriculum offer that encourages lifelong learning\r\n-Motivated staff\r\n-IB World School status and the ability to share our experience with others\r\n-Rejuvenation for the local community due to the diverse training and experience of our students.", "http://www.abbeyschoolfaversham.co.uk", "The Abbey School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013175_coordinator"], ["8RZ", "Developing Innovative Practices to Encourage Languages for Life and Skills for Future Employment", "The Abbey School", 67326.0, "Our project will focus on developing pupil's desire to learn a foreign language by showing the opportunities for future employment that language learning can unlock. We aim to do this whilst developing the skills pupils need for learning, as well as those needed for future employment opportunities. By linking with schools so far apart, we can challenge pupil perceptions that foreign languages only have a limited scope and broaden their horizons by being multilingual in two of the most widely spoken languages.We plan to do this by developing a number of projects and resources which require a range of defined skills, and then sharing the outcomes through Twinspace, newsletters and other online and marketing methodologies such as transnational mobilities and links with other schools and teacher training providers in our local areas. Students will work in intercultural groups wherever possible. In doing so, our project leads to a better understanding of European identity, the link between languages and future employment, and the diverse and changing nature of the common education and employment market of Europe. Moreover, by actively looking for the common European identity, we will promote and consolidate acceptance and encourage students to examine identity and culture, and the role of language within that. Students will have a chance to get to know their European peers from across the globe and keep in touch with them through ICT and planned exchange trips. As well as developing pupil's skills, we also wish to share best practice amongst staff so that all partners can provide training and resources for the partners in their strengths, and access support to help them with any areas they wish to develop. This will ensure the project is as cross-curricular and embedded as possible, but will also lead to developed resources and experience that can be shared with stakeholders outside of the partnership through open access websites such as Twinspace, and eventually training and conferences that can encourage KA1 projects.Project activities are going to include active teaching methods including new technologies, school trips and workshops.

Activities include: 1. Intercultural Communication: in this scheme of work, students consider the nature of culture; the impact of colonialism on culture; how humans communicate; the origins and diversity of language; the link between language and culture; the negative use of language and how repeatedly in history the control of language has been sought. 2. Languages for future employment: in this scheme of work students will look at how multilingualism can contribute to future job prospects. 3.

Questionnaires - an initial questionnaire will be carried out to identify the following:\r\n- Students needs regarding mindfulness, the form they want the mindfulness group to take and potential barriers to them attending the mindfulness group.\r\n- Their current vision, effort, systems, practice and attitude towards learning.\r\nA mid-point questionnaire will be completed to monitor progress and make adjustments where necessary. A final questionnaire will be completed to give us measurable outcomes.\r\n2. Mindfulness group - based upon the feedback from the questionnaires, a drop-in mindfulness group will be established in both schools. Students and staff will be given the opportunity to practice breathing exercises, guided meditation and light yoga which they can then implement outside of the group.\r\n3. Mindfulness mobility workbook - workbook for student visits locally and exchanges to encourage students to engage in their surroundings in a mindful way.\r\n4. Mindset scheme of work and resources - development of activities to encourage students to be more resilient, independent and engaged in their learning, supported by their practice of mindfulness.
