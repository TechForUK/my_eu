The network grew to incorporate projects in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and biotechnologies, namely the 'Food, agriculture, fisheries and biotechnology' (FAB) programme.\n\nProject partners targeted European industry, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as policymakers and young people. It also scaled up a pre-existing informal network of EU knowledge-based bio-economy (KBBE) communicators.\n\nThe project made tremendous progress in its second year. The team continued to build and extend the existing network, significantly increasing the number of participants over the previous year thanks to mass mailings and communication activities targeting the KBBE community.\n\nTeam members adopted a customised communication approach to reach out to the key target groups. Three training sessions were carried out for scientists. Several video news releases were circulated, and 40 articles on KBBE projects were published in various media channels catering to the general public.\n\nTo address the industry, SMEs and policymakers, the 2nd Bioeconomy Forum was organised in 2013 with the participation of high-level speakers and panellists. The CommNet PR Desk was launched, the first edition of the CommNet Innovation Catalogue was distributed, and the inaugural Business Dialogues supporting 12 KBBE projects were carried out. For young people, educational material on bio-economy issues was made available, e-seminars were held and the FAB Education Awards were launched.\n\nCOMMFABNET enhanced the channels of communication flow amongst the necessary stakeholders, helping to foster European business and innovation.

Focus will be on the family environment, socio-behavioural and genetic factors determining familial aggregation. Subgroups with contrasting dietary profiles will undergo an enhanced protocol including measurement of brain activation, expression of genes related to food choice, biological and genetic basis for taste thresholds, role of sleep, sedentary time, physical activity and impact of the built environment.

The project http://www.ifamilystudy.eu/ (I.FAMILY) (Determinants of eating behaviour in European children, adolescents and their parents) is supporting this initiative. The consortium will provide relevant and targeted scientific data on which the platform can base concrete actions that lead to measurable effects.\n\nI.FAMILY has two strategic objectives. The first targets understanding the interplay between barriers to and drivers of food choices and how they affect the health of children and adolescents. The second is to develop and disseminate effective strategies, empowering European consumers to change dietary behaviours as necessary.\n\nThe first project year mainly focused on specifying and preparing a research protocol for following up on the 'Identification and prevention of dietary- and lifestyle-induced health effects in children and infants' (IDEFICS) children's cohort. To realise a feasible and coherent research protocol, work was centred on existing core components, incorporating new components to address project-specific research questions, and ensuring components were applicable to, and acceptable for, the specific target groups (children, adolescents and adults). All instruments, examination protocols and corresponding standard operating procedures were translated into the national languages of the cohort centres.\n\nFollowing this phase, the next 18 months were dedicated to data collection in 8 recruitment centres and providing databases and data management routines on the central data server set up for I.FAMILY. The follow-up survey of the IDEFICS/I.FAMILY cohort was completed in May/June 2014. In total, 9 555 children and 7 794 parents  from  6 135 families took part.\n\nTo date, two methodological papers have been published: 'Clustering of unhealthy food around German schools and its influence on dietary behaviour in schoolchildren: A pilot study' and 'Usual energy and macronutrient intakes in 2 to 9 year old European children'. Another 26 scientific articles are currently being prepared.\n\nOngoing project work will remain focused on overcoming barriers to healthy nutrition by empowering European consumers, prioritising intervention targets and providing evidence-based intervention strategies to policy-players and key stakeholder groups.

Within the overall increased demand for food, and particularly meat production, there is also an urgent need to increase supply of protein from sustainable sources. The principle objective of the international and multidisciplinary PROteINSECT consortium is to facilitate the exploitation of insects as an alternative protein source for animal and human nutrition. Advances have been made in rearing of insects for incorporation in animal feed in countries including China and Mali. The consortium brings together expertise in these countries together with European insect breeders and feed production companies in order to optimise systems and set up pilot scale production facilities in the EU. The project will demonstrate the feasibility of the use of insect-derived proteins in animal feed through trials with fish, poultry and pigs. Quality and safety along the food chain from insect protein itself, to incorporation in feed and ultimately human consumption of insect-protein reared livestock, will be evaluated. The use of waste streams that focus on animal rather than plant material for insect rearing will be examined. To optimise the economic viability of the use of insect proteins, uses for the residual flows from the production system will be determined. Life cycle analyses will enable the design of optimised and sustainable production systems suitable for adoption in both ICPC and European countries. Key to uptake is ensuring that a regulatory framework is in place and this will be encouraged by the preparation of a White Paper following consultation with key stakeholders, experts and consumers.

This, in turn, requires increased flexibility and control over material composition, shape and resolution. To meet this demand the chemistry and the physics behind new and emerging nanoscale fabrication methods must be well understood and this understanding must be systematically deployed to advance these methods into commercially viable fabrication technologies. Simultaneously to ensure that Europe is a significant player in this economically and technologically important industry, the European nanotechnology industry must have access to well trained individuals with both the technical skills and a broad understanding of the physical and chemical parameters governing the performance of next generation processing techniques and, the skills and drive needed for further innovation and entrepreneurship in the nano-technology field.
