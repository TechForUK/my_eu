Aside from the social costs in terms of suffering, they account for 70% on European average of public healthcare systems in the EU. A plethora of ICT based applications have been developed in the last years, allowing to tackle at least partially problems related to specific pathologies. However, even advanced experiences have had limited impact, mostly focusing on pilot applications entailing little or no change on the whole healthcare system. The RICHARD project arises from the need to make healthcare systems more efficient while managing effectively their costs. ICT can be a major change agent in this process, but only if systemic aspects are duly taken into account, such as the interrelation of ICT with organisational and non-technological components of healthcare systems. To do so, a significant shift is necessary to evolve from an application based model, to a comprehensive and sustainable chronic care model, likely to be adapted to the broadest possible range of chronic conditions. The RICHARD project will therefore focus its analysis on the pathologies-specific ICT applications being implemented in leading European regions and elaborate a Joint Action Plan oriented to the integration of those technologies for the deployment of sustainable chronic care models for European regions. This will require a strong coordination of research resources and innovation stakeholders (clearly identified in the first phase of the project) to design new research paths and innovation models. The Joint Action Plan will also be inspired by a medium-long term vision that looks at e-health services into a perspective of economic growth for the regions along the principles of open competition for better and pan-European healthcare services.

More than for technical reasons, this is due  to the level of readiness of the Health Systems to support a organizational, cultural, regulatory, infrastructural changes.\n\nThe 'Regional ICT-based clusters for healthcare applications and R&D integration' (Richard) project intends to facilitate the definition and the implementation of novel models, using ICT, for managing chronic conditions in four regions (Tuscany in Italy, Lodz in Poland, Vasterbotten in Sweden and Yorkshire in the United Kingdom), leveraging on the direct cooperation of Health authorities with the Academic and Enterprise actors  (the triple helix concept) on a shared Joint Action Plan.\n\nThe team also recruited a set of external experts who formed an Advisory Committee assessing the implementation of these Joint Actions.\n\nFirst, the project identified major barriers to the implementation of tele-health services across Europe based on scientific literature. The next step was to develop a telehealth implementation toolkit (the Ready Steady Go toolkit, http://clahrc-sy.nihr.ac.uk/resources-project-reports.html)  to support stakeholders in defining, implementing and delivering effective tele-Health services.  The toolkit was developed in collaboration with the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire (NIHR CLAHRC SY).\n\nA third step was to exchange detailed information about pilots and models already in place in the four regions and to  cooperate to facilitate the cross adoption of them (mentoring activities).\n\nFinally, the project team published the acquired information in 4 languages (see http://www.richardproject.eu) and participated in 20 conferences presenting their strategy. They have also published a brochure, generated four press releases and participated in four web/radio programmes.\n\nThe Richard programme could be viewed as a reference initiative to improve Chronic Care management in Europe using ICT.

The proposed system will extract heat from the autoclave to match existing cooling rates that are specified by material manufacturers. The heat will be stored in a specially designed thermal store at the highest enthalpy possible to maximise opportunities for re-use. We aim to reduce initial energy use in the autoclave by at least 25% through reduction of the autoclave headspace and recover 50% of the energy wasted at the end of the autoclave processing stage for re-use in other energy intensive heating processes such as the post cure process. In addition, we aim to recover compressed air (with its intrinsic compression energy and heat from the autoclave) and heat from the air compressors that create the 7 to 10 bar pressure and integrate this with the system.\n\nOur proposed technology would have a major impact on end-users and the environment. In summary we could achieve energy savings of 639,000 kWhr per system p.a; equating to \u20ac66,000 in end-user increased gross profit potential per system p.a. and would reduce CO2 emissions by 318 Tonnes p.a.", 232714.0, 1192696.0, "ENRSYS", "Recovering energy from autoclaves", "Engineers are advancing a system to recover energy from industrial autoclaves.

Since 1995 it has been coordinating, following, monitoring, evaluating and disseminating all the activities and experiences related to the implementation of digital skills in the region and it has a major role in the current project.\r\nAll phases of the project also will be unified within an ETWINNING dedicated project/group that, in addition to further strengthen the digital skills of those AD who still do not know the eTwinning platform, will allow an even greater regional and international cooperation, a careful  and constant monitoring of all activities as well as their wider dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe OBJECTIVES of this project are all aimed at increasing methodological and digital skills to the  AD who act as driving force for the whole school community and for the network of regional training.\r\n\r\nThe TRAINING ACTIVITIES will focus all around the attendance of high-level digital technology training as well as job shadowing activities by partner schools.\r\nTherefore, starting from Summer 2018, AD will be able to  take  chosen courses (ie, the York Associates courses in York, at the University of Wolverhampton in the UK or at ETI in Malta; or our best choices, courses at the Future Classroom Lab Brussels) or get in touch  with the partner schools to organise job shadowing experiences.\r\n\r\nThe FOREIGN PARTNERS of the project have been chosen due to a dense network of relationships which the leader of the consortium in the first place (in the figure of Servizio Marconi) and the project participants can boast as a result of long-term activities in this area.\r\nThe regional eTwinning representative  and other eTwinning colleagues have also been able to count on the variety of contacts and experiences already implemented within the platform and ask absolutely reliable and, above all, \"tested\" on the use of digital in everyday teaching foreign partners, to actively join this project.\r\n\r\nThe SELECTION of participants AD has been done  according to objective and qualified criteria: territorial representation for a guarantee of wider diffusion, belonging to the regional network of schools and training center and to the  most active schools on the subject; possession of methodological and technological  expertise that makes the AD already a trainer for other digital trainers and staff of all the schools.\r\n\r\nMONITORING process and EVALUATION methods will be continuous, throughout the project in order to assure quality and sustainability to the project itself.\r\n\r\nThe IMPACT of the training activities conducted abroad by the participants will have a very positive impact of all those involved and in different contexts, from the personal, to the college, from the local to the wider professional community, at regional and national levels.\r\n\r\nThe DISSEMINATION of these experiences will therefore be conducted in \"circles\", gradually larger, in order to reach not only the \"experts\" but the widest possible audience of stakeholders involved and interested in the issues of the application of digital technology in educational settings, thanks to the dissemination that Servizio Marconi, USR and the Ministry of Education will undertake to give prominence to the experience of school-administration synergy that at present is unique within the national scene.", "http://www.steeton.bradford.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047418_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BD20"}
