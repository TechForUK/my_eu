These objectives will be achieved through a carefully crafted network of academic and non-academic partner organisations co-operating worldwide.\nManagers and practitioners of social enterprises often lack an easy access to the frontiers of science. FAB-MOVE will significantly improve the transfer of knowledge between academics and non-academics and thus increase the practical applicability of research findings. For an enduring sustainable impact, FAB-MOVE develops a teaching tool to educate (future) managers of social enterprises on how to set up their enterprise in a specific environment, how to combine business with a social goal, and how to develop strategies for growth and scaling-up. \nCurrently there is a lack of knowledge about the influence of different social and economic environments on social enterprises. Local eco-systems and traditions have a decisive impact on the wellbeing, growth and potentials for scaling-up of social enterprises. FAB-MOVE focuses on the embeddedness of social enterprises and its impact on their evolution. It identifies crucial success factors for a sustainable development of these new and innovative organisations in an internationally comparative perspective.\nThoroughly analysed case studies will serve as best practices by highlighting how social enterprises overcome crucial problems and manage to grow in different social areas and various regions around the world. In particular, the cases will shed light on how managers of social enterprises cooperate with stakeholders and how their environment composed of promoting actors and existing (political) structures meet their needs in order to improve social cohesion all over Europe.", 11521.0, 1017729.0, "FAB-MOVE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200055_929024679"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1LY", "1+2 Language Training", "Inverclyde Council", 37064.0, "The main aim of this immersion course is to further the linguistic knowledge and understanding of the the 31 teachers and support staff within their set language.\r\nOur team have all previously completed the 1+2 initiative with training from LFEE.

Whilst interacting with native speakers and colleagues alike, the team will be challenged to speak, listen and think within this language. \r\nThroughout this period of accelerated learning the candidates will be building a passion for the culture through seeing it in action. The knock on effects of this experience when they return to the classrooms will be huge for us in terms of students, learning and teaching, engagement and results.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nForm a strong sense of camaraderie within the team prior to traveling - sharing knowledge and experiences, each participant will develop a full personal improvement plan.

Within the staff, there are individuals with relevant and necessary experience and skills, however to meet the larger goal of embedding these languages across all teaching and learning at all stages, it is necessary for more staff members to develop skills and confidence in speaking French and Spanish, knowledge of the people and culture of both of these countries and techniques and methods for teaching these languages to pupils in an engaging and innovative manner.  The objectives of our project are therefore to expand and consolidate the overall competences of the staff in these areas by organising a mobility experience for five specially selected members of staff to participate in immersion courses in France and Spain, equipping these staff members with the necessary skills, knowledge and confidence to lead on the implementation of teaching and learning in French and Spanish and in the embedding of this in all aspects of school activities for all age groups in the school.  This will be achieved in part through the systematic and structured transfer of skills and knowledge between the staff members undertaking the mobility and the rest of the staff at the school upon the return of those participating in the immersion courses.  These five members of staff have been chosen in order to ensure sufficient representation of both the infant and senior stages of the school, as well as the need for members of the Senior Management Team to take part directly, gaining first hand experience.  All selected staff members already have a degree of fluency in the languages in question (in one case, the staff member has experience of teaching in Spain) or prior experience of such immersion courses in another language.  A further key aim of this project is to develop a methodology for measuring the degree of achievement of the objective to embed teaching and learning in French and Spanish.  It is expected that, through this project a certain amount of every day teaching and learning in the school will take place in French and Spanish, with activities involving both languages becoming a truly integral part of the experience of attending Whinhill.
