There are several topics: the disabled, minorities and social dialogue . There is a big difference in the care and welfare in the various European lands. Our first youth exchange showed that the differences within Europe are great in the field of taking care for minorities in a country. ( theme of the exchange was anti - discrimination) . Basis on this information, we have devised this into a project, so that young people can develop by doing voluntary work in the Netherlands itself.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project\r\n- Young people learn in ten days of each other's culture through activities and to enter into dialogue with each other .\r\n- Young people learn to know themselves better in ten days , to learn from each other and gain new insights into helping other people.\r\n- Young people learn in ten days to do volentary work for  minorities (how you can help other people) .\r\n- Young people learn in ten days skills to discover their talents and develop.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nThe participants will be in the age of 16-25 years ( which is the focus ). Six youngsters and one group leader from four countries will participate. The group will consist out of boys and girls (the same amount) and  the diversity within the group will be large . We want different young people from different backgrounds involved in the project . Thinking of ( potential ) drop outs , youth who have had nothing to do with  volunteer work, young people who are active as volunteers , etc. It is also important that young people can make themselves understood in English and can understand English .\r\n\r\nDescription of activities :\r\nDay 1 and 2:\r\nAre devoted to know each other . Several team building activities will be done , icebreakers are deployed and the house rules will be jointly devised and described ( think of dealing with each other , speak native language , etc. ) . The various participating organizations will present themselves on the basis of a presentation .\r\n\r\nDay 3 :\r\nThe topic will be discussed for the first time through activities. Those activities provided different thoughts and experiences on the subject.\r\n\r\nDay 4 :\r\nIs dedicated to learning from each other's cultures , this related to the theme. The day will be filled with role plays , discussions and presentations . The end of the afternoon we will think of  the activity we wish to do with the elderly people.\r\n\r\nDay 5 :\r\nThe morning will be dedicated to Dutch culture and we will do a tour in Delft . In the afternoon, the activity in the retirement home will take place here, we will cook together .\r\n\r\nDay 6 :\r\nIn the framework of the subject several roll games / theater -like activities will be prepared and implemented today. End of the afternoon will be devoted to the subject disabled , then the activity will be prepared for the next day.\r\n\r\nDay 7 :\r\nTaking care for disabled people in different countries is very wide . We therefore want to do a tour at  Ipse de Brugge. After this, the young people will perform the activities they  prepared with a group of young disabled people in the same age as the participants. In the evening we will do a joint assessment with the findings and lessons learned that day (and the differences between the elderly and disabled ) .\r\n\r\nDay 8 :\r\nThis day we will do a tour in Amsterdam. We aim to show the tourist side of the Dutch culture. In the morning we will visit a number of museums , lunch together and then the participants can enjoy themselves in Amsterdam. \r\n\r\nDay 9 :\r\nAttention will be paid to Erasmus + and the Youth Pass .

They also have felt what it is like to volunteer.\r\n- Young people have discovered some of their talents which they can use in the future .\r\n- Young people have learned to be open to other cultures , visions and possibilities and come out stronger.\r\n\r\nPotential longer -term benefits :\r\n- Young people are committed more in the minority in their own country.\r\n- Young people learn how to prepare and carry out an activity , which they can use for activities they wish to carry out in their own country .\r\n- Young people learn to reflect themselves and may have benefit as they are (starting ) professional .", "http://www.uccrew.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-NL02-KA105-000785_3"], ["0XQ", "Actualizaci\u00f3n pedag\u00f3gica de centro a trav\u00e9s de la Ense\u00f1anza Biling\u00fce", "Grange Valley Primary School", 16858.0, "Dion Casio School is a state school located in the area known as Pol\u00edgono Nueva Ciudad. It has 23 teachers and about 200 pupils. It is a school which has been working as a Learning Community since 2011 and, thus, it is open to the whole community (families, volunteers and other agents), through several activities which have been proved to lead to success, such as: Interactive Groups, Reading Discussion Groups (Tertulias Literarias Dial\u00f3gicas), Classroom Assemblies, Learning Contracts\u2026 From all these, there are two of them which are strongly connected to the project tthat we are applying for: Interactive Groups (pupils carry out simultaneous activities coordinated by volunteers \u2013relatives or other members of the community- through dialogue and mutual help) and Reading Discussion Groups (debate through dialogue among equals about classical works, in order to arise pupils\u2019 interest towards reading in Spanish and English).\r\n\r\nThe school has Bilingual Section in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th levels of Primary and a bilingual programme in Pre-Primary is carried out through routines and the Doman psychomotricity method, term projects about different classical works of the Anglo-Saxon literature, etc. The school\u2019s aim is to have Bilingual Section in every level and, gradually, become a whole Bilingual School. \r\n\r\nWe should also bare in mind the huge diversity within our pupils: we have families with many different sociocultural profiles. Some of them have a low sociocultural level, with very little possibilities and, in some cases, low involvement in their children\u2019s education. Learning foreign languages is not a priority for them, and we consider that the fact of developing Erasmus+ projects is the key to make these pupils find the meaning for learning English, thus increasing their motivation and engagement. Besides, taking into account the results of the internal and external assessment procedures in our region is also fundamental. The Management Team considers that, as a possible response to this need, taking part in Erasmus+ projects can be an agent of change, and this transformation process is one of the key aspects dealt with in our school institutional documents: Educative Project, School Year Planning, Management  Regulations, among others.\r\n\r\nIn this KA101 we intend to do these mobility activities: \r\n\r\n- 3 different courses on idiomatic competence of the participants, which will help them acquire the needed qualification for getting Bilingual Section in all levels of the school and, gradually, become a whole Bilingual School. This fact will make the school get a better reputation in the area and, thus, the number of enrolled pupils per year.\r\n- 3 courses on bilingual methodology for teachers who already have the qualification but, however, need training on methodology for improving their teaching skills, which will ensure pupils' benefit, thus increasing their motivation and results.\r\n- 2 job shadowing actions, which involve observing the partner school in Haydock (UK), with whom our pupils have carried out several collaborative activities through eTwinning last year. Our aim is that the involved teachers acquire new skills and knowledge on school management, creation of new materials, classroom organization, etc., apart from keeping up with the development of cooperative activities between schools and reaching our internalisation.\r\n\r\nThere will be direct consequences in our school, due to the fact that the training that teachers will receive will be subsequently transmitted to the rest of the teachers. This will bring direct benefits in the pupils. Since the three members of the School Management Team are part of this Erasmus+ Team, there will be a guarantee that this project will have an impact on the school\u2019s everyday routines, ensuring its permanence and sustainability in the future. Furthermore, in September 2018 we will form a Work Group, institutionalized through the Center of Teachers and Resources of M\u00e9rida, in order to ensure the rigor and the permanence of the suggested activities and iniciatives. This way, the dissemination will take place before the project starts (present stage: communication to the rest of the teachers and the families, design of activities, etc), during the project (daily work with pupils, mobility of the participant teachers, social media and blog update, follow-up of the newly created Erasmus+ Google Site\u2026) and after the project (social networks, school\u2019s blog and Google Site, appearing in the region\u2019s social media, activities as a host school with our partner school, permanent contact with them concerning the future creation of a KA2, etc).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it will be a global transformation process in which our doors will remain open to Europe.", "http://www.grangevalley.st-helens.sch.uk/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-047004_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA11"}
