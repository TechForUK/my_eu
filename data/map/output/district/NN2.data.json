This has led to dramatic cultural, social and political changes and challenges. The study of diaspora and migration has therefore evolved into a burgeoning field of research with an urgent practical relevance. In a wide and sometimes confusing array of approaches it is mainly covered by the humanities and the social sciences. The CoHaB Network unites world-leading institutions in this field in the conviction that interdisciplinary training as well as international and inter-sectoral co-operation are key to any productive study of diasporas. CoHaB gains scope and momentum by its \u2018Network of Networks\u2019 rationale, binding together already existing cooperations. It is based on the resolve to strengthen interdisciplinary research in the field with a view to establishing diaspora studies as a transdisciplinary research area in its own right. Training young researchers on the basis of this conviction means to provide them with the opportunity to conduct their work in a variety of disciplinary environments as well as outside a purely academic context. Specifically, CoHaB aims at stimulating and facilitating cooperation by negotiating core concepts between the various disciplines involved among the partner institutions. Each of these disciplines has developed its own, highly sophisticated understanding of diaspora studies, and it is high time that these diverse understandings entered into a sustained dialogue. For this purpose, early stage researchers from various disciplinary backgrounds, but with similar interests in the field of diaspora studies, will join forces to develop their projects on a shared platform. This will assist them in opening their projects to a strong, interdisciplinary research environment and in producing tangible results for their own research careers, for the scientific community, and for the general public at large.", 225226.0, 2701544.0, "COHAB", "Reconsidering diaspora research", "The concept of diaspora needs to be re-examined because of the changing nature of modern-day events such as conflicts and wars, and labour mobility due to globalisation.

The purpose of this project is to promote digital learning across the boundaries of physical spaces, across curriculum subjects and across languages and cultures, to facilitate collaborative learning across national boundaries. Over three years we have adopted three 'learning across boundaries\u2019 themes:1. Technology Outdoors: bridging formal and informal learning by extending learning beyond traditional classroom spaces and supporting learners with disadvantaged backgrounds by managing transitions positively through collaborative outdoor learning experiences.2. Stem to SteAm: adding the Arts to the integrated study of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths creating inter-disciplinary challenge-based online learning resources.3. Technology Enabled CLIL: using curriculum contexts to teach language competencies and cultural sensitivity with aim of meeting the language needs of a diversity of learners, including learners for whom English is an additional language (EAL/EFL).ParticipantsOur target groups are lecturers in Higher Education Initial Teacher Training programmes, trainee primary teachers, in-service primary teachers, and primary-aged pupils across four European countries in order to demonstrate how the innovative use of technology can quickly influence the curriculum at a number of levels. We aim to approach our three themes in an aspirational way by involving local cultural institutions and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Aims The main aims are to:1. Develop a strategic partnership consisting of teacher educators, teachers, trainee teachers, school pupils and representatives from cultural institutions and SMEs, to explore how teacher education can accelerate innovation.2. Promote digital learning beyond boundaries across physical spaces, traditional curriculum subjects, and languages and cultures, and so have an impact on teaching and learning across school and university sectors.The partnership also aims to develop: -  a Digital Leader programme for teacher education institutions. -  the digital competences of participants across the project themes. -  eTwinning project materials based on the project themes in cross-national teams.  -  connectedness via face-to-face events based on the concept of Digital Playdates, linking educational and cultural institutions, and SMEs. -  a MOOC on each of the three themes, extending the scope of the project materialsMethodologyEach year will begin with a 5-day training event taking the form of a Digital Playdate initiating the development of the main yearly theme and sub-themes. Cross-national groups will leave with ideas for a methodology and lesson plans on their chosen sub-theme. They will then develop and test their ideas for two months, and document and share as eTwinning projects over the following two months. In April the groups will meet again for 5-days to refine methodology and ideas in preparation for a MOOC and the launch of eTwinning project kits.In May and June each country will host a Digital Playdate as a CPD event for local teachers, held in cultural institution and supported by an SME.Project outcomes will include:- MOOCs on the themes of Technology Outdoors, Stem to SteAm and Technology Enabled CLIL, each consisting of a reusable and remixable set of content materials and an ongoing online community of practice. - interdisciplinary eTwinning kits on the project themes uploaded to the eTwinning platform.- a series of international and local teacher CPD events in the form of Digital Playdates and one Super Playdate.- a Technology Outdoors set of eTwinning project kits designed to support learners from disadvantaged backgrounds during transitions by helping them to manage change in a positive way. - a Technology Enabled CLIL set of resources and eTwinning project kits designed to support learners from disadvantaged backgrounds with additional language needs.- a Stem to SteAm set of resources and eTwinning project kits promoting interdisciplinary learning - a Digital Leaders Programme promoting technology use and eTwinning in schools - a series of papers and journal articles based on data collected on the project themes.

The Partners comprise schools and school networks, NGOs, and University research centers. It aims to address the challenge of early school leaving (ESL) by focusing on an approach aimed at the prevention, through new pedagogical strategies for co - operation and strategic planning between actors of formal and informal education, between school and local community. Taking as term of reference the statistical data for 2013, stating that 12 % of young people aged 18 - 24 in the EU are Early School Leavers, the title of our project recall the objective of \"Europe 2020\": reducing such rate below the 10%. ESL is a tragic phenomenon for young people because it can lead to social and economic exclusion, low employability, low self - confidence and often deviance. ESL is a tragedy from both the social point of view since in a modern democracy, responsible and active citizenship requires high levels of education ; and it is also a problem for  economic development because it depletes the \"human capital\" necessary for the \"Knowledge Economy\". The international scientific community agrees that ESL has  a systemic nature. Starting from this concept, our project aims at developing transversal and multi - disciplinary solutions and methods so as to develop the skills which both schools and informal education actors need to work together;  and to introduce didactic methods oriented to re - motivating  all students, included those more disadvantaged; and to develop local strategic medium and long term plans to prevent and counteract ESL.  Notably our project intends to achieve the above mentioned objectives through the realisation of two Intellectual Outputs:1. a social qualitative research of drop - out aspects and causes  in the Partners' countries that can be  considered paradigmatic of the generality of European contexts;2. a model of training and participative co - project planning based on an Action / Research approach to problem-solving and which allows and enables the local actors to study ESL in their territory, to innovate learning systems and to elaborate together a local integrated plans of action. Such plans will be developed through:- an initial phase of  local workshops for joined training of \"first level stakeholders\" (teachers, professional educators, volunteers and social workers);- a second phase of practical work, i. e. implementation of what has been learnt and projected during the workshops: so pilot - experiences developed by the participants to the workshop with young people, inside and outside the schools (not only with young drop - out, but also those that can be a positive example for peers de-motivated or border - line);- a conclusive phase during which the \"second level stakeholders\" come back for further training to reflect on the lessons learnt by working with young people, and propose to \"first level stakeholders\" (principles, headmasters, local institutions representatives, CSOs manager) local and multi-annual integrated plans to prevent and reduce ESL. As for expected results, our project purposes are:to update the frame of knowledge on ESL and drop-out causes, in order to reach  more effective policies and practices;to create or enhance local networks among schools, local institutions and associations involved in the work with and for young people;to elaborate Local Integrated Plans against ESL;to spread  innovative methods both in formal and informal education;to empower and  increase school success for disadvantaged young people involved in the pilot - experiences.   The long - term expected results and impact are:- to enhance the capacity of formal and informal education systems to work together by planning objectives, methods and action tools. - to optimize the use of financial resources, towards a new \"education community welfare system\"- to contribute at the definition of more effective policies against ESL - at national and European level - in order to meet the objective of \"below 10%\" as more as possible in all the EU countries.", "http://www.northampton.ac.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA201-024125_8"], ["7AL", "SEN Employment links: Working with Employers and Trainers to support Young People with Special Educational Needs/Disability into Employment", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 195957.0, "In the context of a rapidly changing economic situation in the EU, reflected in a changing labour market, the international project Special Education Needs Employment Links (SENEL) focuses on supporting transition into the labour market from vocational education and training (VET) and further education (FE) for young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).

It will also witness the Partners making a ground-breaking attempt to change the current paradigm of teaching entrepreneurship at HEIs. \r\n  \r\nCurrently, there are 816 master and 198 bachelor degree programmes in social sciences offered by European Universities and the demand for courses in social sciences is growing (UNESCO: World Social Science Report 2010, www.masterstudies.com). The role of social sciences, however, is progressing from social engineering to a wider set of contributions to society. Therefore, there is a need for more fundamental and \u201cjoined-up\u201d reflection upon the needs of societies coping with ICT, welfare, migration, climate change and ageing population. \r\n \r\nHEIs have an essential role in forming the next generation of social entrepreneurs, prepared and positioned to solve these problems. However, they are faced with numerous obstacles \u2013 most notably by a lack of cohesive campus-wide vision for social innovations and a lack of staff. \r\nOur studies show that students overwhelmingly prefer professions in the social sector; however, they are more interested in \u201cexperiencing\u201d rather than studying social innovation by becoming involved in its implementation (CC survey, n=36, 20.03.2015). Therefore, HEIs that wish to implement a culture of social innovation must be ready to increase the flexibility of teaching pathways, incorporate student-driven activities into their curricula and use Massive Open Online Courses. \r\n \r\nThe Project has THREE ESSENTIAL AIMS: \r\n1. Fostering the implementation of social innovation at European universities (mainly in Centr. Europe) by developing and mainstreaming useful instruments addressing the demands of HEIs: model curricula, step-by-step guidebooks, explanatory videos and sourcebooks,\r\n2. Changing the paradigm of entrepreneurship education by making it more practical and student-oriented through developing, testing and implementing flexible and project-oriented learning pathways,\r\n3. Increase the accessibility of Centr. European universities by mainstreaming the MOOCs (as an example we will use designing social innovations).\r\n \r\nThe Project is BASED ON FOLLOWING PILLARS: \r\n1. A far-reaching and socially important idea translated into a comprehensive and coherent implementation concept that includes a \u201cdesign and test\u201d formula, deep involvement of Partners and networks (\u201cThe envoys of Social Innovation\u201d) and empowerment of stakeholders to shape the project in a manner that guarantees its relevance to the current demand of the target group,\r\n2. An innovative approach, which consists in the combination of: student-led learning activities (new to the world innovation), a mentoring programme for incubation, using open learning communities in formal learning and exploiting elements of massive online teaching in Social Innovation,\r\n3. A strong partnership. The Partners specialise in various fields and thus complement each other. Together, they will constitute a complete environment for the development of academic entrepreneurship: HEIs, business incubators, entrepreneurs and social organisations.\r\n \r\nThe project will IMPACT the following groups:\r\n\r\nDIRECTLY: \r\nEUROPEAN HEIs. They will benefit from adapting and exploiting the instruments and learning curricula, a redesign of the learning environment (classrooms, campuses, communities), improved quality of teaching, strengthened research.

B/ Create a culturally, linguistically and age appropriate open-access multimedia education programme which recognizes and draws on children and young people's assets, knowledge and experiences to support their healthy use of the Internet.  C/ Develop open-access culturally and linguistically appropriate guidance and training  to enable teachers to use the multimedia programme with children in primary and secondary schools in diverse European education settings.  D/ Work with young people, their parents and teachers to co-design, evaluate and re-evaluate the multimedia programme within a range of school environments to ensure a user-centred, evidence -based system which supports children and young people\u2019s online safety. E/ Develop and disseminate a model of participatory design which can be used by teachers and academics in schools and other  settings to support children\u2019s involvement and the presence of their voice and perspectives in design processes for educational and community-based digital projects. Led by experts in digital technologies, education and pedagogy, the project will work with teachers, children and parents in order to develop, implement and evaluate a collaborative educational programme aimed at enhancing the digital citizenship and wellbeing of children in Europe.  The project is inspired by the European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids (BIK, 2012) framed around supporting children to make use of the Internet in order to enhance their learning and social connectivity while staying safe. By addressing this issue in schools, the project aims for additional outreach to parents, families and NGOs and addresses children's unequal digital participation and exposure to risk ( Livingstone et. al. 2014).  Through the participatory and cyclic design approach, participants will be central to the project's activities and intellectual outputs: Children will influence the design of the online system; teachers will influence the educational format and participants will have the opportunity to engage with, and learn from each other.  Working with children in this way has the potential to offer unique insights and genuine engagement, ensuring that the project will achieve lasting impacts for children, teachers and parents.  In developing children's digital, social and emotional literacy in this way, the project, aims to support young people - in partnership with their schools, teachers and parents - to become active, responsible, open-minded members of society (Paris Declaration, 2015). The project consortium is led by the University of Northampton (UK) and has 3 partners: UC Limburg (BE), Dimotiko Sxoleio Kalamatas (GR) and Via University College (DK). The team  will work with up to 120 children aged 8-14 directly and 2000 indirectly in four schools. The project fits with both European and national priorities, developing methods to support children to make use of the creative, connective and educational opportunities offered by the digital world and  enhancing their skills to do so safely. The approach taken will also support development of 21st century skills pertaining to local and global citizenship, life skills, ethics and personal and social responsibility.", "http://www.northampton.ac.uk  ", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA203-024399_coordinator"], ["7AL", "Equity and Social Inclusion through Positive Parenting", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON", 314105.0, "Equity and Social Inclusion through Positive Parenting (ESIPP).\r\n\r\nCONTEXT\r\nAutism is a lifelong condition which affects about 1% of the population (or approximately 7.5m European citizens) as well as those who live with them and care for them. \r\nThe presence of autism can be extremely challenging to parents and other family members, and autism has been identified as causing greater family and parental stress than any other disability. The condition can challenge traditional parenting styles and cause parents to feel deskilled and disempowered.  The presence of autism within the family can negatively affect the educational achievement, employment opportunities and social inclusion of mothers, fathers, siblings and the individuals with autism themselves.\r\nTeaching parents to understand the condition, and to work effectively with schools and other professionals, has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for individuals with autism and their families. However, though such parent education programmes have been developed in e.g. Western Europe and the USA, there is little or no availability of such programmes or materials in many areas within Europe, for example in the Balkan/Eastern Mediterranean region.  \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn order to address this inequity, a strategic partnership has been developed involving universities, non-governmental organisations and the parents of children  with autism to:\r\n-develop an evidence-based model for delivering parent education in autism that can be used across Europe\r\n- develop a core curriculum and ecologically valid parent education training materials\r\n- use these materials to provide parent education to families living with autism in areas where it has been previously unavailable\r\n- evaluate the effectiveness of the materials and the impact of the training using quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis\r\n- share the model curriculum, tools and materials with stakeholders and make recommendations to policy- and decision-makers.\r\n\r\nPARTNERS\r\nThere are nine partners in the strategic partnership. These are:\r\n- the University of Northampton (United Kingdom)\r\n- the University of Zagreb (Croatia)\r\n- the European University (Cyprus)\r\n- Target Autism Training and Consultancy (United Kingdom)\r\n- Centar za Autizam (Croatia)\r\n- The Centre of Development and Support for Children and Teenagers - Autism  Assessment Support Practice (Cyprus)\r\n- Macedonian Scientific Society for Autism (Republic of Macedonia)\r\n- Autism Concern (United Kingdom)\r\n- Autism-Europe (Belgium).\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nEighteen parent training events will be held over the lifetime of the project, six each in Croatia, Cyprus and the Republic of Macedonia. Local trainers will be supported by experienced experts to develop their skills so that the training programmes can become self-sufficient and continue beyond the lifetime of the project. \r\n\r\nFour parent/professional conferences will be held  - in Croatia, Cyprus, the Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom - to share the teaching materials with and obtain feedback from wider groups of parents and professionals, as well as providing learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe partners in the project will also present at national and international conferences (e.g. Autism-Europe International Congress, 2016) as well as producing academic reports and academic articles.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe project undertaken by this Strategic Partnership will utilise a collaborative, action-based and stakeholder-empowering methodology, using mixed methods of data collection and analysis. \r\nThe project has been designed to use methods which will realise practical, real world outcomes.\r\n\r\nRESULTS EXPECTED AND LONGER-TERM BENEFITS\r\nThe final evidence-based model, curriculum and learning materials will be made available via the Erasmus+ dissemination platform, as well as via the individual partners and project website.\r\n\r\nHelping parents to understand their children with autism and to effectively manage their behaviour will have significant benefits regarding social inclusion, quality of life, educational achievement, employment and equality of opportunity. as such, this project will contribute to the development of a more equitable and socially inclusive Europe in both the short, medium and long terms.", "http://www.northampton.ac.uk  ", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA204-013397_coordinator"], ["7AL", "Knowledge is power, age ain't matter!", "THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHAMPTON HIGHER EDUCATION CORPORATION", 154556.0, "The purpose of the \u201cKnowledge is Power, Age ain't Matter\u201d project is to provide more opportunities for people aged 50+, making them more active and counteracting social and digital exclusion by developing and disseminating know-how on how to commence and conduct non-vocational education at higher education institutions within the framework of the Academic University of the Third Age.\r\nFive universities from different parts of Europe take part in the project: from Poland \u2013 the Pozna\u0144 School of Banking, from Turkey \u2013 K\u00fctahya Dumlupinar University, from the United Kingdom \u2013 University of Northampton, Italy \u2013 University of Salerno, Spain \u2013 University of Vigo. \r\nProject participation and experience exchange among partners representing public and private universities, specializing in different disciplines from economics to technical, to medical, to pedagogical, and with different experience in the tuition of people aged 50+, coming from different countries diversified in terms of territory, culture and religion, and at different economic and social levels shall ensure that the solutions and outcomes of the project will be international in nature and applicable in practice. \r\nThis project is a response to issues identified during reviews and research held and conducted by all project partners, and specifically: \r\n - low level of activity or participation in non-vocational education by people aged 50+, in particular males. Reason: lack of a non-vocational training offer suited to their needs and interests, and lack of motivation due to insufficient awareness of people aged 50+ about the benefits from lifelong learning (LLL).\r\n - low level of digital competencies- ICT, and lack of motivation to use them resulting in social and digital exclusion of people aged 50+,\r\n - missing know-how at many higher education institutions related to the use of the potential they have: educational, organizational and infrastructural to drive and conduct non-vocational lifelong learning for people aged 50+ \r\n - lack of competencies among academics to prepare and conduct non-vocational courses adapted to the needs and learning capabilities of people aged 50+.\r\nTo help counteract and address the presented problems the following actions were planned in the project which shall translate into results and outcomes.\r\n1. Creation of a survey to research interests of people aged 50+ (split by females and males) as well as their motivation to undertake personal development activities, with research held at partner universities as a follow-up.\r\n2. Survey data to be used to select 40 topics for courses and workshops for people aged 50+ as well as the development of curricula. At least 50% shall address the needs of males, since they make up just under 20% of people 50+ who are active.\r\n3. Insights shall be used to prepare an effective marketing campaign dedicated to the group aged 50+ and to create promotional materials that will be used in focus group research. \r\n4. To prevent digital exclusion of people aged 50+ a Moodle50+ platform shall be developed for remote learning and communication, suited to the capabilities and needs of people aged 50+ and five 18-hour long blended learning courses shall be prepared on ICT, adapted to the pace of learning of people aged 50+.\r\n5. In order to improve the skills of partnership universities\u2019 staff in teaching people aged 50+ they will be trained on the methodology of preparing and conducting classes for people aged 50+ using Moodle50+. For dissemination purposes they will run similar workshops for their universities\u2019 staff.  In addition, a manual shall be prepared on how to teach people aged 50+.\r\n6. The presented project outcomes will be regularly disseminated on the project website and will serve as input to develop an innovative tool dubbed AU3A Guidebook (Academic University of the Third Age Guidebook), which will be a compendium of know-how, tools and best practice for universities in EU, to commence and conduct non-vocational education of people aged 50+.  \r\n\r\nIn order to test the manual, offer and for promotional purposes Dumpupinar will start a Third Age University pilot in which 50 people aged 50+ will take part.

In the Egyptian context most studies have illustrated that both faculties of education and the Ministry of Education have for the longest of time adhered to very traditional methods of teacher training, which not only wasted resources but also did not lead to any learning or improvement of performance all of which has deterred educational reform at both the higher educational levels as well as school levels.  Teacher performance being the key factor for learning has been selected as the most strategic entry point to reform.

From experiences with international cooperation in particular with the EU it has become apparent that when Egyptian systems are exposed to innovative thinking overtime there tends to be a gradual shift particularly of culture with partnerships that are strong in imparting both clear and tacit knowledge through exchange, dialogue, joint activities and exposure.
