While the ADVANCE Forum concept engages all stakeholder groups in a parliament-like structure, specific representative committees drive the innovative progress. Specific attention will be given to workflows depending on the level of urgency and on who is requesting utilization of the framework: regulatory authorities, vaccine manufacturers, public health organizations.\n\nADVANCE partners leverage their recent pioneering achievements in establishing operative technological platforms, developing pharmaco-epidemiological methods for burden of disease, coverage, effectiveness and risk. ADVANCE partners also build on a track record of delivering results of ground breaking international collaborative studies of unprecedented population size. ADVANCE capitalizes on these achievements and tailors structures and processes to the needs of collaborative public-private vaccine benefit-risk assessment. ADVANCE partners will provide access to data on more than 40 million subjects for testing of methods and immediate studies.  \n\nThe existing technical platform boosted by the strong connection to the IMI EMIF project and many other synergistic initiatives will allow ADVANCE to focus on creating access modalities and accelerating exploitation of both underutilized and established rich data sources, to test innovative methods for integrated and vaccine specific benefit risk assessment, and to undertake real life studies from the outset of the project. \n\nConsortium: The ADVANCE Consortium is designed to engage all stakeholders in Europe, while ensuring project feasibility by careful selection of a small group of 15 partners driving progress..

Influenza infections affect all age groups but children and adults over the age of 65 are at most risk of developing severe disease.\nVaccination is the most effective approach to reduce the impact of annual influenza outbreaks and potential pandemics, however, the currently criteria of correlates of protection(CoP) show limitations in predicting protection for seasonal and pandemic vaccines. \nThe Haemagglutinin Inhibition(HAI) antibody titre is the most widely used CoP for seasonal influenza vaccine even if there is a lack of standardisation for conducting HAI and other serological assays and therefore  results obtained from different laboratories are not comparable. This leads to the urgent need of  improving international standardisation of serological assays to reduce inter laboratory variability and to generate supportive immunological assays to be used in studies aimed at developing clinically relevant surrogate markers of protection of influenza vaccines.\nObjectives: The main long-term aim of the FLUCOP project is to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and to develop new assays for the better evaluation of the CoP of influenza vaccines.\nMain specific FLUCOP objectives include:\n-\tachieve standardization of HAI and Virus Neutralization(VN) assays;\n-\tpromote the understanding and application of Cell-Mediated Immunity (CMI) and Neuraminidase (NA) assays as tools for the evaluation of influenza vaccines; \n-\tdevelop selective new assays which might potentially used for future clinical trials for influenza seasonal vaccine evaluation\nFLUCOP Consortium and Project Impact: The FLUCOP consortium brings together 26 groups from 7 European countries, and includes contributors from the academic, governmental, non-for-profit and pharmaceutical sectors. As a whole, the consortium has a balanced array of expertise and each group has been carefully selected to avoid overlaps in research activities and to collectively address the planned objectives. FLUCOP is expected to have a significant impact to improve and standardize the existing immunological assays and develop new assays to better evaluate influenza vaccines. This will contribute to the future clinical trial evaluation and possible establishment of correlates of protection Through a public-private collaboration FLUCOP will reach a common agreement on assays and methods to be used by all groups both from the public and private sector for testing influenza vaccines in humans. These efforts are expected to aid evolution of the regulatory guidelines and the practice of the pharmaceutical industry following the application of the methods to efficacy studies.\nProject plan: To reach the proposed objectives, the FLUCOP project is composed of five focused interconnected work packages(WP).\nWP1:Standardization of HAI and VN assays.\nObjective: HAI and VN assays are commonly used to quantify influenza specific antibodies but they show to be highly variable between laboratories. Moreover different protocols are in use in different laboratories, which may contribute to the variability of the assays. This WP aims to improve the standardization and harmonization of these assays and also preparation and qualification of critical reagents.\nMethodology: Adult and paediatric pre and post influenza vaccination serum samples will be available to consortium partners who are recognized as leading experts in serological analysis of influenza vaccine responses.

Together with EFPIA partners our aims will be to set policy & guidance and deliver robust information technology tools to address the potential for the reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through mobile applications and the recognition of drug safety signals from user comments in social media and the internet. The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages. A mobile app for direct reporting of ADRs to national authorities in E2B(R2) Individual Case Safety Report compatible format will be developed. To achieve this we propose to expand the prototype MedWatcher Social platform to include social media monitoring in the EU and the MedWatcher App for reporting ADRs.\n\nAnalysis\nLed by UMC and working with SRDC, WEB-RADR will ensure the technical platform for gathering drug safety data from social media delivers meaningful and useable data in the EU pharmacovigilance setting. It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis. It is essential to detect and manage duplicate reports. A major effort in WEB-RADR will be the advancement of new methodologies to meet this challenge.

However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

It is known that successful laser based refractive eye surgery can reduce or even cure common vision refractive errors, as well as, degenerative disorders like keratoconus, which is due to a corneal disorder. But while refractive surgery is becoming more affordable and safer, results are not as successful as they should be. As a consequence, this technique might not be recommendable for everybody, thus a detailed patient evaluation of his or her cornea should be made before deciding whether a refractive laser based surgery is adequate or not.\n\nBased on this fact, the main objective of the POPCORN project is to develop a non-invasive and accurate corneal prediction system. This system will be based on a new imaging technology that will generate a personalised and in-vivo biomechanical model of the patient's cornea. This model will be used to predict the biomechanical behaviour and status of the cornea after surgery. This will allow detecting and avoiding possible risks and negative side effects that could lead to the need of further additional treatments or even, long-term consequences in the visual health of the patients.\n\nThis technology development will be possible thanks to the introduction of plenoptic imaging techniques that will allow generating the specific in-vivo patient model without any invasive technique.

QUEST partners pioneered methodologies for using much more of the information in seismograms recording seismic vibrations of quakes.\n\nData from seismograms for many earthquakes were fed into a computer model that simulates each wave as it rumbles away from the earthquake's epicentre. The resulting 'synthetic' seismograms were compared to real seismograms and identified differences were then fed back into the model to improve it.\n\nTo map the Earth's internal structure in sufficient detail required highly complex calculations that can only be carried out by powerful supercomputers.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\n\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of  participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year. It would offer them an \u201c\u00e0 la carte\u201d programme of qualification, embracing different job skills, technical linguistic capacities and intercultural exposure, all designed to meet the individual\u2019s specific needs at the time.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal advantages of the teaching programme resides in the cross-fertilisation between these 3 aspects which make up the whole experience. To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 6 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration from level V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience. Whilst the periods of mobility can vary, the teaching plan contains the same stages and objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Pre-departure: collective socioprofessional guidance sessions accompanied by individual assessments. Intercultural and language preparation.\r\n\r\n2. Abroad (outside France): practical internship in a company meeting the profile or personal project of each participant, with constant monitoring to measure linguistic and professional progress, certified by Europass and level tests.\r\n\r\n3. On return to France: session to assess what has been learnt from this experience, followed by accompaniment during 3 to 6 months to allow the participants to:\r\n\r\n- Develop their capacity to summarise and explain in their own words the key skills acquired in relation to the specific professional context they have chosen.\r\n\r\n- Learn to identify what experience and training is most relevant to maintaining a competitive professional profile on the job market, this in a logic of \u201cLong Life Learning\u201d.\r\n\r\n- Acquire a continuous ability to judge their own progress, their technical, linguistic and intercultural skills, hence enabling them to position themselves to advantage vis-\u00e0-vis European or international recruiters.\r\n\r\n- Identify concrete employment opportunities: a major indicator of the impact of our project is integration in the job market within 6 months.\r\n\r\nWe have built a partnership network with 9 experienced intermediate organizations in 8 different countries to ensure optimum welcome and logistics for participants. Clear specifications are drawn up with appropriate norms against which performance is measured, supervised by the IERF and a Piloting committee. Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\n\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we have created a federation of 25 centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 150 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. The Region itself is also an active partner in the project: its involvement since our foundation, \u201cguarantees\u201d the quality of our services and will help us to enlarge still further our partnership networks to other teaching organizations or local authorities. It will accompany us in the renewal of our request for certification of the project in May.

The institute hosts 854 students (633 in the Technical institute and 221 in the linguistic high school) coming from several municipalities of the Bari hinterland. Although the institute has been fighting for students to impose themselves within the labour market through training and cultural activities, high rates of school transfers and repetitions were registered in recent years and this calls for a deeper reflection and the implementation of specific activities in order to reduce early school drop-out levels. The school staff has been wondering on the actions that could be implemented to further motivate students and prevent their school drop-out; after a questionnaire, it was highlighted the necessity to integrate new didactic technologies and value them at their best through the use of proper methodological systems able to reduce early school leaving  (39%), to improve linguistic skills and competencies related to specific disciplines such as technical subjects, informatics, mechanics, graphics and telecommunications (27%) , as well as understand different foreign mentalities in all of their aspects so that they can be brought to students together with concrete knowledge and import the adequate tools to strengthen students\u2019 international placement.\r\nHence, it is necessary to train 24 participants through a 15 day mobility period abroad, during which they will carry out job shadowing activities and structured courses in different countries. In details, the project plan foresees the mobility of 7 professors teaching linguistic disciplines in Finland for job showing activities at the school \u201cEnglish Matters\u201d so that they can perfect their linguistic competencies and update themselves as regards new applications in international working scenarios ; other 7 teachers of different disciplines will be engaged in structured courses at the partner institute \u201cBohemia\u201d in Belgium in order to learn new didactic methods to counteract early school leaving. \r\nAfter their mobility, it is estimated that the participants will integrate within their daily teaching, the innovative methodologies they learnt abroad; the mobility of the institute\u2019s Headmaster in Finland will allow the comparison between the Italian school system with the Finnish one as well as the valorization of the project\u2019s purposes; mobility of 2 ATA members who will discover Finnish educational institutes and experiment a powerful school culture; the other 7 teachers of non-linguistic disciplines showing great interest towards Clil methodologies will attend structured courses provided by the partner \u201cCome2England\u201d so that they can improve students\u2019 learning outcomes by offering a more international perspective and transmitting a more participative and open attitude. \r\nAfter their mobility period, teachers will integrate an entire didactic unit in CLIL mode.

Moreover, it will strengthen the collaboration among all members of the school community (school leaders, teachers and non-teaching staff, learners, parents/families) in this process, which will have positive effects on the integration not only of the migrant and refugee children, but also of their families. The successful inclusion of newly arrived migrant children in the educational system can pre-empt later integration costs.\r\nEducational authorities at local, regional or national level will have access to improved tools which can be mainstreamed in the local, regional or national education systems to promote the inclusion of newly arrived migrant and refugee and to combat ESL (at local, regional or national level).\r\nBy enhancing the participation and learning performance of migrant and refugee children in primary education, the project connects with other Erasmus+ and EU activity, since, as mentioned above, it will contribute to the Erasmus+ Programme objectives, to the objectives set by ET2020 of promoting equity, social cohesion and active citizenship and of improving the quality and efficiency of education and training, and the further implementation of EU education policy, as well as to the implementation of the Action Plan on the integration of third country nationals.\r\nThe availability of the developed methodologies and the School Support platform in several languages (and the Platform\u2019s continued operation), as well as their wide dissemination and transfer across schools, educational authorities and stakeholders at local/regional/national and European level will promote the impact of the project on EU MSs education systems and policies.", "http://www.canarywharf-consulting.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE03-KA201-035608_3"], ["9FJ", "CULTIVATE SCHOOL ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET THROUGH HOLISTIC APPROACH TARGETING TEACHERS AND PUPILS", "RINOVA LIMITED", 277191.0, "According to the study of the EU (2012)  <Building Entrepreneurial Mindsets (EM) & skills in the EU\r\n* evidence suggests that developing Entrepreneurial mindset is a key ingredient of endogenous growth & a must for sustainable local & regional development & social cohesion.\r\n* the role of education in promoting entrepreneurial attitudes & behaviors is widely recognized today.

Digital stories are often presented in compelling, interactive and emotionally engaging formats. Recently, the use of maps and connected media for digital storytelling has increased. Story maps combine interactive maps and multimedia content into user experiences. Geographical location helps organizing and presenting information.The role of storytelling with maps in education has not been reviewed due to its contemporary  nature. So far, there has been no research about the potential impact it might have on the engagement of learners. However, storytelling with maps offers high levels of active engagement as it allows people to personalise their contribution, it gives possibilities for creative collaboration, the potential for changing perceptions and opportunities for deep learning through discussion and sharing of the stories.The specific aims of the project are:- to explore factors of preventing drop-puts rates from school through digital storytelling and digital mapping- to enhance two key competences of early school leavers and those at risk of early school leaving: digital competence and communication competence- to raise awareness of the reasons of early school leaving and for the personal consequences of this decision- to pass on experiences from early school leavers to the next generation- to contribute to reducing drop-out rates from schoolThe project will start with a research phase on the results of previous projects related to early school leavers, and on the topic of digital storytelling and mapping. Based on the results of the research, the development of the project will follow: early school leavers will be trained to gain digital competences; then, they will put them into practice by producing visual materials which will be showed to the public afterwards.These aims will be pursued by the method of digital storytelling with maps. With this method, early school leavers are trained in key digital competence to tell their story of leaving and the consequences this decision had on their lives.The most important is the impact on the beneficiaries themselves. Early school-leavers (aged 15-25) will be motivated to re-enter education and training by:- reflecting their own life stories, the consequences of their decision to drop out, and the benefits of alternative pathways- increasing their self-esteem through being proud of their capacity to produce and publish high-quality digital content- acquiring key competences (digital competence, communication in the mother tongue, language competence) which increase their employability and may be the starting point new training and career pathways.Adult educators, teachers and youth workers working with young people with a background of (potential) early school-leaving will be made acquainted with an innovative approach which is extremely activating and motivating through using the beneficiaries\u2019 inclination towards new media and through boosting their self-esteem by making them the subject and object of digital stories published in the internet.The Tell your story consortium brings together 6 partners from 6 European countries (France, Austria, Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, Slovenia).

Some countries have well determined schemes, levels and qualifications (UK), while others do not have any official qualifications, or the training schemes cannot be put into practice (Spain, Portugal). All this adds up to the lack of training culture, professional ageing (this situation hinders the access to e-learning training) and long working days, which hinders professional retraining.For all these reasons, society does not value this fishmonger occupation, and makes it occupationally unsolicited, resulting in the loss of market share for the retail format.e- FishNet will try to connect with the new consumer, increasingly practical, interactive and new sale strategies lover, with fishmonger\u2019s collective.

They generally arrive with weak, if any attachment or link to the host country and have gained qualifications and work experience in very different labour market conditions. On EU average, it takes between five and six years to integrate more than 50 % of humanitarian migrants into the workplace and as much as 15 years to reach a 70 % employment rate converging towards the outcomes for labour migrants (European Parliament). Long periods of inactivity also lead to demotivation and deskilling; deskilling in turns means that they could only accept low-skilled jobs, remaining trapped in a low socioeconomic cycle. This impacts on their willingness and resilience to effectively commit to their integration.

Hence, the project will follow a game based blended learning approach to make use of the existing positive attitude towards using online games and social media \u2013 in combination with an accompanied training offer and guided learning opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of Health Points are to:\r\n- Develop a game based approach and learning game to provide an attractive access to information on health prevention and education for young disadvantaged groups;\r\n- Equip trainers, educators and youth workers with an innovative tool to promote awareness for and provide information on health related topics in their training or in any other context or initiative addressing young disadvantaged people.\r\n\r\nWhich ultimately aims to:\r\n- Reduce unhealthy behaviour patterns and lifestyle diseases among young adults;\r\n- Promote motivation for self-responsibility and changing unhealthy behaviours into healthier ones;\r\n- Empower young adults to take care of themselves as important contribution to their employability and active citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn the first phase the specific needs and interests in terms of health education and promotion as well as perceived barriers will be explored by means of interviews and dedicated focus groups involving both trainers and young adults themselves. On the basis of findings from this activity, the methodological concept will be created, with specified learning objectives, together with the organisational structure of the training programme (game and setting according to the contextual surroundings) will be set up. The learning game will be the technical realisation of the methodological concept. A technical framework will incorporate 'gamification' and 'nudging' aspects. Its goal is to create an highly interactive learning environment and resources for trainers and learners. The learning game will be implemented in a fully responsive HTML5 framework supporting smartphones, tablets, desktops and notebooks.  \r\n\r\nThe game-based approach to Health Points with be designed to be integrated into existing educational initiatives for young disadvantaged adults. Trainers and facilitators  working in these contexts will be supported to use the game as an integrated, interactive learning resource that will be accessible and attractive to their learners, using techniques, devices and media that respond to many disadvantaged young adults positive responses to non-formal and non-traditional learning programmes. Health points incorporates robust processes for the testing and validation of its design. Feedback and experience will be gathered in order to adapt and improve the approach. The piloting will also be used to evaluate changes in motivation, action taking and awareness towards health literacty issues among the beneficiaries and to validate competency developments. This will be published together with an assessment of the results and case studies will be compiled in an impact study report. The project will be completed by the production of an e-Manual guidance publication. It will describe the design and use of the Health Points Programme and the game in a user-friendly and non technical language. This will provide background information on the importance of promoting health and well-being literacy and awareness to young adults, and highlight the reasons why the learning targets were chosen and why they are relevant for young socially disadvantaged adults.\r\n\r\nHealth Points will create very concrete products that can be used also beyond its life cycle in many different settings involving young disadvantaged adults.

Many sectors are undergoing rapid technological change and digital skills are needed for all jobs, from the simplest to the most complex\u201d.\r\nDigital technologies are key drivers of innovation, growth and job creation, and therefore digital competence is increasingly linked to participation in the labour market. Digital competence is not only about being familiar with digital technologies, but also about the way new technologies & online media are used. In terms of digital skills, considering that to function effectively in a digital society more than low level skills are needed, about 45% of the EU population can be considered as insufficiently digitally skilled (having either low or basic digital skills). In Romania 74% of the population does not have the skills they need to function effectively in the digital world, while the share is over 50% in Greece, Portugal & Italy and over 40% in Spain. \r\nThe internet is changing employers\u2019 recruitment and selection methods, and the process of job search by individuals. Employers and recruiters are not only posting vacancies on the internet, but they are increasingly using the internet (incl. social media) to screen and select applicants. Despite the significant increase in the use of ICT & social media by low-skilled/low-qualified adults, they demonstrate a low level of awareness and understanding of the broader implications that their online activity can have on their social & professional life. \r\nIt is thus important that low-skilled/low-qualified adults (especially over 45) to develop their media and digital skills so that they are able to effectively use social media in a way that can generate increased opportunities for them in the social and professional arena.

The gap in labor market participation at EU level between EU citizens and migrants has increased in 2014 (Eurostat\u2013Migrant Integration Statistics-Employment). During the last eight years, the activity rate (% of active persons in comparison to the total population) of the EU-28 population of non-EU countries has recorded systematically lower activity rates than EU citizens. Since 2009, this gap has increased noticeably (3 % points). Also the unemployment rate per sex and educational background is higher for migrant women with low educational background (Eurostat). Cultural, social barriers, low skills and media illiteracy discourage these women from actively seeking for jobs. As a result the pressure is enormous on the welfare systems and society itself of the EU-28 countries.\r\n\r\nThis project suggests the empowerment of low skilled migrant women by developing 42 digital tools for trainers for implementing innovative workshops to develop the social,  civic, cultural and media literacy (SCM) competences to achieve active citizenship\r\n\r\nThis project builds upon a successfully completed project, EMKIT. The objective of EM-KIT was to tailor an empowerment online tool for trainers in order to empower low skilled migrant women to reach active citizenship (AC). EMKIT was based on the AC ladder (scale), an innovation introduced in EMKIT. This scale suggests that a woman who is living in isolation (stage 1) must progress through all stages in order to achieve AC. These stages are:\r\n*Isolation\r\n*Going Outside\r\n*Joining In\r\n*Voluntary Work\r\n*Working on Professional Qualifications\r\n*Active Citizenship\r\nEMKIT toolkit also includes 35 digital interactive tools (i.e. 35 activities/short workshops) that can be implemented to address the needs of migrant women, depending on their stage on the active citizenship ladder.\r\n\r\nEMKIT2 aims to:\r\n1.

However, socio-economic integration is difficult to achieve for a refugee and humanitarian migrant coming to Europe. In order to achieve socio-economic integration, an individual has to more than access public services, or gain entry into the Labour Market. \r\n\r\nThe Strengthening Employment, Education and Employment Skills for Integration \u2013 refugee, migrant and asylum seekers (SEESI) project will establish the frameworks and curriculum to create a role that enables first language support on key concepts of the local labour market, economic, social and civil integration whilst transitioning the individual refugee to be able to effectively access and benefit from available host country services. Socio-economic integration is a long term and holistic process, incorporating a wide range of different elements, including: refugees and humanitarian migrants application process advice; general Information, Advice and Guidance on benefits, housing and local support services; skills and education development; employment support and community engagement. Without one element in place, not only will have the socio-economic integration process have failed for the individual but it could also result in long-term instability, community isolation and general lack of social participation on a range of levels for the individual. A key reason for this failure is ultimately the language barriers that exist for refugees throughout Europe. \r\n\r\nThe SEESI project\u2019s main objective is to resolve a fault to the socio-economic integration process through mobilising a unique 'Life(skills) before Language' (LBL) approach to the language barrier that refugees and migrants experience upon arrival in Europe. Through developing the skill-sets of \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Workers, who are often the first contact point, refugees and migrants meet in their new host country, the SEESI project aims to revolutionize the socio-economic integration process throughout Europe. The SEESI project aims to design a unique training LBL framework and curriculum which will change Support Workers role from helpful members of refugees/migrants own community into a new dynamic job role, responsible for an essential progression route for new refugees/migrants entering Europe and the local community and ultimately the labour market.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, currently provides advice and guidance to refugees and migrants, in their mother tongue language, which often provides key information to these groups. Furthermore, official Refugee Support Workers, Employment Advisers, Counsellors, Integration Advisers, as well as local municipality staff depend greatly on the work Support Workers do especially in interpreting and language support. By developing the skill-set of the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker, from basic advice to targeted socio-economic integration service, the role will become more formalised, increase skill-set and will be able to offer targeted support which will ultimately support refugees and migrants integration.\r\nThe SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker will develop training, mentoring and teaching skill-sets alongside their wider community support role, which will ensure that refugees and humanitarian migrants also have the opportunity to develop their skills, knowledge, and wider competences from day one of entering their new host countries. This alternative strategy, Life before Language, will result in refugees and humanitarian migrants gaining the Labour Market skills they require, while learning their host countries\u2019 language on a parallel basis. Rather than the current format where a refugee and humanitarian migrant can only develop civic, social and labour market skills once they have gained a basic level of their host countries\u2019 language. This revolutionary strategy offers a fast track approach of Refugee integration and all through the development of the Support Worker role through the SEESI project.\r\n\r\nThe SEESI project will achieve this through the creation of 6 innovative intellectual outputs designed to increase the Adult Education sector\u2019s knowledge on integration issues, while formalising a unique training methodology aimed at developing the SEESI \u2018in-community\u2019 Support Worker creating the future dynamic Refugee Support Workers. Alongside a training curriculum, the SEESI project partners will create Community-based Train the Trainer manual and guidance, offering accessible guidelines on how to deliver the SEESI Support Worker training programmes to volunteers and staff, as well as launching the SEESI outputs on a digital learning platform.

Encouraging entrepreneurship for youth is part of the European Reference Framework on Key Competences, while the Resolution adopted by the European Parliament in 2015 stressed the role of Social Entrepreneurship and Social Innovation in combating unemployment. Social entrepreneurial competences, such as business and strategic planning with a social dimension, will be the main pillar of the capacity building course curriculum to be developed for the young potential entrepreneurs within the scope of PROMYSE. Elements of entrepreneurship education such as marketing and promotion will form part of the course curriculum. Social entrepreneurship constitutes a flourishing field of work, which not only facilitates entering into the labour market, but also doing so contributes to the community\u2019s well-being by solving pressing social issues of the society, generating a positive return in society. PROMYSE seeks to exploit this advantage by (re)skilling youth accordingly to actively join this field. The project will provide the young participants with the fundamental skills, knowledge, tools and mind-sets to put \u201ctheir entrepreneurial ideas into practice\u201d, while serving the community as well. Following this approach, challenges in the participating countries, which may have come as a result of persisting socio-economic crises, can be tackled in the long term with the introduction of new health and social care services, designed and applied by the young participants of the project. PROMYSE essentially grants a unique opportunity for young people to contribute to their communities while advancing their own career needs.\r\n\r\nThe second Sectoral Priority (YOUTH) is 'Promoting high-quality youth work, particularly in the processes related to youth development'. The project partners, active in the youth work field, will gain considerable insight on identifying and analyzing the needs of youth, especially with regards to education and training, and will build their internal capacities to better meet those needs. The project lays down activities that intend to satisfy the needs of young NEETS, setting fertile ground for applying their creativity and initiative. In this sense, partners are implicated in crucial youth work aiming at engaging with youth to deal with issues like unemployment, low educational attainment and social exclusion. The Role of Youth work is stressed in the EU Youth Strategy, which stipulates that youth work \u201ccontributes to all fields of action [of the Strategy] and their identified objectives\u201d. Youth work is elevated in PROMYSE by the increased capacities of the organisations as a consequent of implementing the activities but at the same time promoting employability of young people in this sector while providing recognition of the skills for conducting this work in a transnational framework (Youthpass and CPD Accreditation). The project equips young people with the necessary skills to get involved in youth work themselves, since the health and social care sector is a field directly related to improving the conditions of subsistence for children and young people.\r\n\r\nFinally, the project will address Horizontal Priority 'Open and innovative practices in a digital era', by developing and providing a modern, integrated and holistic e-learning and networking platform, tailor-made to the needs of young prospective social entrepreneurs. This will allow them to develop and enhance their social entrepreneurship and business skills; improve their understanding in social entrepreneurship principles and community needs in the field of health and social care; and identify social entrepreneurship and collaboration opportunities.
