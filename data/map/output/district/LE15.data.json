The aim is to use natural extracts from plant sources with the potential to be used as biocide adjuvants for the chemical sector. The study will focus on the inclusion of adjuvants of an antioxidant nature of synthetic and natural origin in commercially-available formulations of domestic insecticidal and/or fungicidal products, and industrial pesticide products. Natural adjuvants will be those deriving from plant, fruit and vegetable residues such as pine bark and grape seeds and from medicinal plant extracts. The inclusion of these adjuvants will enable the percentage of customarily-used biocide to be reduced in formulations so as to thus obtain pest-control substances of a more environmentally-friendly nature. The two areas of application will be against urban pest insects and for wood preservation against xylophagous insects and fungi. The main objective of this project involves studying the synergism between antioxidant bioactive molecules of different types and synthetic biocides included within the new European Biocide Directive 98/8/CE (BPD), for the development of new pesticide products whose performance features may clearly help to distinguish them from other products available on the market. Using this strategy, the aim is for the resulting anti-pest product to be competitive both economically and effectively with regard to those existing on the market whose biocidal characteristics are unquestionable, albeit problematical due to their high level of toxicity.", 178566.0, 1179088.0, "BIMOSYN", "Synergising eco-friendly pesticides", "Biocides are chemicals commonly used in pesticides and wood protectors to protect against flies, cockroaches, termites, wood-rotting fungi and other pests.

Scientists investigated the use of promising plant extracts from antioxidant-type and medicinal-type plants in certain insecticides and fungicides. Their aim was to reduce the toxic chemical concentration while increasing their efficacy against pests.\n\nScientists were highly successful in their endeavours and several breakthroughs were achieved. After screening several extracts, two compounds were shortlisted for use in wood protection and urban pesticide products. Tests were carried out to enhance synergy with selected chemicals and optimise the extract-to-biocide ratios.\n\nProject partners successfully increased wood resistance against fungal degradation and xylophagous insects such as termites and bark beetles by using these extracts with wood protectors. Several insecticides combined with extracts showed better house fly control than insecticides alone.\n\nProject partners developed water-based biocide prototype formulations for urban pests and wood protection that demonstrated good chemical stability and biological efficacy after optimising the extraction process. In accordance with European standards, their effectiveness and ecotoxicity against certain fungi, termites and Hylotrupes larvae were tested with promising results.\n\nBIMOSYN members then worked on industrial validation of their prototypes through real case scenarios such as testing timber impregnation with formulations in an autoclave. Fungicides showed wood penetration up to 20\u00a0mm and passed criteria for use in fences and doors not permanently exposed to fresh or salt water. Insecticides demonstrated effectiveness against cockroaches but were not commercially viable due to the plant extract extraction and addition process.\n\nSMEs are working on commercialising the wood protector and sprayable insecticide products after further optimisation and patenting.

Four young people from the Czech republic and Great Britain are invited to join several work teams within the organisation under the supervision of experts in  the field of apllied research and restoration and management of protected areas as well as teachers of inovative educational methods. Project will take place from October 2014 to September 2015 in Slovakia in two offices of the organisation, one in the capital Bratislava, the other in a historical town Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, a UNESCO World heritage site. Competencies gained during the one year service in a non-governmental organisation with 20 years of experience can help young people  to improve their employability. Thanks to the chance to grown not only on professional but also on personal level can increase their chances to find their place in the society and contribute to its gradual change. \r\n\r\nProject aims to activate young people to contribute to the development of harmonious and balanced environment \u2013 in both social and environmental area. It helps young people to gain a wide variety of practical  skills and competencies (intercultural and social relations, communication and organizational skills, discovering their talents and motivation). Participants will assist in the following activities: management of protected areas \u2013 fieldwork, digitization of maps, creation of new educational materials and tools, assisting in the educational programmes, general administrative support and assisting in PR activities. Participants are encouraged to create and work on their own ideas and little projects, which can increase their ability to determine their own goals and find support in their pursuit.  Personal development will be supported by regular interaction with a mentor and couch. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that the participants will bring new ideas and initiatives for work in the organization, improve our skills in intercultural work teams, enhance our ongoing activities in the scientific and educational field and help to develop educational services (educational programmes for children from kindergarten to primary and secondary schools in English language). Additionally, project will have a positive impact on life in our community and cooperation among all stakeholders involved in the works of the organization.

The volunteer will be part of the educational team preparing the programme of an exciting international camp with 3000 children and young people that will take place in summer 2016 in Germany. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\n- To provide the opportunity for a young volunteer to develop her competencies through volunteering in IFM-SEI\r\n- To connect an EVS volunteer with a global group of local volunteers to prepare and implement a wide range of educational activities together, mainly at an international camp\r\n-  To enhance internal communication and raise awareness of Erasmus+ and EVS within our global membership\r\n\r\nThe volunteer will be involved in these four areas: \r\n1) Working with international volunteers to prepare the educational programme of the international camp 2016. This will include communication and coordination of the international group, developing activities and running them at the camp as well as producing the camp handbook to disseminate the educational work.\r\n\r\n2) Working with international volunteers to contribute to the development and running of seminars. This involves for example the annual European Falcon Network Seminar, a seminar on internationalism, a training for trainers and on child poverty. \r\n\r\n3) Contributing to the development of information and communication strategies in IFM-SEI. \r\n\r\n4) General involvement in activities prepared by IFM-SEI secretariat according to the learning needs and interests of the volunteer. \r\n\r\nThe project is based on non-formal education, as this is the core of our movement.

The range of problems is very wide, and is mainly experienced by the South (Latin America, Africa, Asia). Therefore, a transition to a new economy and a sustainable use of natural resources is necessary. To reach this change in our own country, we need strong leaders and entrepreneurs who stimulate sustainable development in both the North and the South. In September 2014 CATAPA, together with Mediaraven, Putumayo and Act 4 Change, will start a new campaign named \u2018Generation Transition\u2019. The aim of this campaign will be to offer the new generation or 'Generation Transition' (managers, leaders, politicians, CEO\u2019s, teachers etc) skills and tools on sustainable development, in order to make the transition towards a society that uses resources in a sustainable manner. We will thus offer the young generation the opportunity to learn how they can contribute to a sustainable society. \r\n'CATAPEDIA 2.0' forms part of the first, logic, phase of the campaign: the phase of preparation and development of educational tools by gathering, systematizing and production of different media for dissemination of information. The project 'CATAPEDIA 2.0' will contribute to the education of \u2018generation transition\u2019 by producing multiple ways and media of formation, education, communication, and other learning methods for spreading the information about sustainable use of resources. The focus will thus be on solutions on how to contribute positively to a new economy. We will do this by stimulating entrepreneurship and leadership skills, and by focusing upon the \u2018good practices\u2019.  \r\nFor 'CATAPEDIA 2.0' we are looking for 2 volunteers, both with different tasks, though tasks can coincide. One volunteer will mainly be responsible for communication. Task for this function can be: writing articles, managing the (digital)library, following-up social media and website, making powerpoints and prezi presentations, and gathering relevant information on sustainable use of resources for CATAPA's website and digital library. The other volunteer will mainly be helping out with making short video clips and organizing events. Tasks will among other be: editing short videos on the subject of sustainable use of resources, offering guidance to students, welcoming new volunteers and organizing information meetings and masterclasses. As mentioned before, tasks of both volunteers can coincide and overlap and both volunteers will collaborate intensively. The volunteers will assist us in our office in Ghent.\r\nEverybody can apply, but important is, that the volunteers believe in the possibility of a more sustainable future and are willing to work for it. Moreover, they must be familiar with social media such as facebook and twitter and a basic knowledge of editing short clips adds value.\r\nAs is apparent from the description of the project's background, we believe a transition towards a more sustainable future is necessary. We will start from this believe, by offering the new generation educational tools with the expectation that these tools will have a positive impact on the transition towards a more sustainable society. We hope students will make use of these tools for many years, also after the end of the official campaign. We are in close contact with our partner organizations and networks, which according to us, is very important in the elaboration of our campaigns and actions. For the volunteer it would be an opportunity to get to know CATAPA, our partner organizations and the themes we are working on. We think sustainable development and the depletion of resources is an inevitable theme and we offer the volunteer to gain experience in this.

In their work they try to contribute to the local civil society, to help their professional development and enhance the capacity of youth involvement in local life. \r\n\r\nThe main aim of the project is to develop and promote knowledge of post-conflict reconstruction and peace building, by producing analytical reports and articles for publication and dissemination by Kartlosi and others. The other aim of the volunteer is to assist the work of Kartlosi, for example through teaching English and running movie and discussion clubs for local youths, organisational and administrative work, building networks and partnerships, and planning and implementing projects. This will provide the volunteer with the chance to learn skills in several key competencies and will enhance the volunteer\u2019s knowledge of how peace building and conflict resolution works in practice.

The first audience to receive the reports and articles will be the local community. The second audience will be the peace building community in Georgia who can then more generally offer insights from their peace building initiatives in Gori to be extended beyond this area. The third audience are interested parties beyond Georgia \u2013 what lessons can be learned from conflicts in Georgia to improve our knowledge and understanding of conflict resolution, post-conflict reconstruction and peace building. This will be a key part of the plan to disseminate the work of the project through Kartlosi's website and social media, and by forming new partnerships and networks with other NGOs across Europe, especially in the UK. The project also aims to provide opportunities for local people, especially youths, to have the chance to improve their practical English language skills taught by a native speaker.

Under the current context of climate change, which is above all characterized by extreme weather phenomenon, droughts are becoming more frequent and longer which, associated with heat waves, increases the chances of large wild fires with enormous destruction of forest and biodiversity. But the effects of forest fires are not limited to that single year. It\u2019s not know yet how long it takes for the environmental web of relations, here represented by the plant-pollinator relationship, to be fully recovered. This has immediate consequences at the forest level, but also at the agriculture level (less pollinators less agriculture production) and at the level of honey producers. The EVS volunteers, all unemployed undergraduates, will come to help in studying these effects and to understand the side effects for foresters, farmers and honey producers.\r\n\r\nThis project has the following objectives: (1) Help young European researchers in developing scientific research work, from the planning, through implementation and to evaluation and publication; (2) Help young European citizens in understanding their role within the European Union and to work in partnership with others to safeguard the European environment, through the use of European Environmental legislation; (3) Interaction with local stakeholders (foresters, farmers and honey producers) in order to collect information on the effects of wildfires both in space and time; (4) contribute to increase the citizen knowledge on the consequences of fires and what measures can be taken to reduce their incidence.\r\n\r\nThis project is a partnership of two sending organizations (from different countries) with one receiving organization, involving three volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe activities will involve from planning ones, to field work in science, to conversation with involved stakeholders to collect information and environmental education with school children and other visitors to the Open Day at the receiving organization Field Study Centre. The methodology will be mostly informal learning, putting in practice what the volunteers have learned at the university and gaining experience for a future career in research or any other environmental field. The educational side of the project might require some extra help to get the volunteers to learn some communication techniques, but nothing too difficult.\r\n\r\nAs expected results we hope that the volunteers will learn how to plan a research and communication project from the planning stage to the implementation, evaluate and report. All this done with a good team work in international partnership.

The project will contribute to the objectives of the Bristol Green Capital (BGC) programming by providing enthusiastic and capable volunteers to act as BGC \u2018change agents\u2019 in communities across Bristol: increasing capacity and raising the profile of local projects that are making a positive impact for sustainability in the city.  This will serve to heighten the legacy of BGC by providing exciting, life-changing cultural and work experiences to young Europeans passionate about sustainability. By embedding Green Capital European Voluntary Service (EVS) into its voluntary and delivery strategy, BGC can create a long term and far reaching legacy by supporting the change agency, skills development and employability of young people.The objectives of Green Capital EVS are centred around building sustainability skills and boosting the employability of young volunteers; providing an opportunity for young people\u2019s perspective on sustainability issues in the context of a European Green Capital, and; increasing capacity of Bristol Green Capital 2015 (BGC) to deliver on its objectives. Volunteers will act as BGC ambassadors and researchers assigned to different areas of the city, their activities overseen in by CAUK and \u2018Field Work\u2019 hosts. The \u2018field work\u2019 (voluntary) activities will be designed with Bristol\u2019s Neighbourhood Partnerships and/or via the BGC Thematic Action Groups, ensuring activities are directly linked to BGC. Volunteers will increase capacity of their \u2018Field Work\u2019 hosts to support and deliver sustainability projects in the context of BGC, whilst using this experience as a platform to learn about and explore sustainability issues that are important to them. These research topics could include: energy, waste, community, nature/green spaces, food, skills/employment, etc. This will encourage ownership over the project and a genuine youth-lead perspective. The research method envisioned is action-based research with participants engaging directly with existing community activities, events and projects. Length, Dates and Scale:Bristol Green Capital 2015 (BGC) is a year-long event, with activities and projects taking place between January 2015 and December 2015 (12 Months). The Green Capital EVS mobility activities will take place in June-August, as the summer months are to be the busiest and most active period for the BGC programme.

The project will take place from September 2015 to September 2016 in Slovakia in two offices of the organisation, one in the capital Bratislava, the other in a historical town Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, a UNESCO World heritage site. Competences gained during a one year service in a non-governmental organisation with 20 years of experience can help young people to improve their employability.

It helps young people to gain a wide variety of practical  skills and competences (intercultural and social relations, communication and organizational skills, discovering their talents and motivation). Participants will assist in the following activities: management of protected areas \u2013 fieldwork, digitization of maps, creation of new educational materials and tools, assisting in educational programmes, general administrative support and assisting in PR activities. Participants are encouraged to create and work using their own ideas and create small projects, which can increase their ability to determine their own goals and find support in their pursuit.  Personal development will be supported by regular interaction with a mentor.\r\nIt is expected that the participants will bring new ideas and initiatives for work in the organisation, to improve our skills in intercultural work within teams, enhance our ongoing activities in the scientific and educational field and help to develop educational services (educational programmes for children from kindergarten to primary and secondary schools in English language).

We first started organising voluntary activities in 2006 and since then have held over 20 nature conservation events with more than 100 participants.Located in Southern Estonia, close to Karula National Park and part of the Natura 2000 protected area, Parmu Ecovillage is a living embodiment of the pristine wilderness that Estonia is famous for. Flooded river meadows, deep primeval forests, picturesque lakes and rivers, mysterious swamps and rich wildlife \u2013 we have it all. The high water in spring called the \u2018fifth season\u2019 \u2013 where one needs a canoe to navigate between the different holdings within the village \u2013 is a breathtaking nature\u2019s spectacle.The main objective of this EVS project is to introduce to the Volunteer the knowledge of how to make decisions that simultaneously consider economical, social and environmental realities, both short and long term, with a specific focus on agriculture, gardening and silviculture. All means of support and learning conditions are provided to enable the Volunteer to acquire new skills, knowledge and understanding of the key principles of ecology and sustainability. The Volunteer works alongside professionals responsible for the habitat preservation and restoration of the Ecovillage - where most lands are part of the Natura 2000 protected area - helping out with nature conservation tasks as well as guiding and supervising local youth and visiting groups of children who participate in those activities. Working methods are mainly observational - biological monitoring, conducting assessments / diagnosis and recording observations about the landscape / animals / plants / insects with the focus on four ecosystem processes: community dynamics, water cycle, mineral cycle and energy flow. The Volunteer will be 18 years of age or older - only one volunteer will be selected for the 2016 project. Other than that, the Volunteer doesn\u2019t need to have any special skills or be very fit to carry out the voluntary conservation work. Use of tools and techniques are quite simple and easy to learn by anyone. At the minimum the Volunteer should be physically able with the potential of carrying out light regular open-air tasks such as pasture walking.The Volunteer will be living in a fully furnished private flat. The Volunteer has to cook for him/herself and is provided with a weekly organic food box (either including meat or vegetarian) plus all eating/cooking utensils. The Volunteer gets a personal bicycle and is allowed - having proven competence in horse riding - to ride horses within the Ecovillage. The Volunteer doesn't have to pay anything for participating in the project and will get a monthly payment of \u20ac100 per month to cover essentials.The Volunteer will have an allocated Volunteer Supervisor who provides help and support to the Volunteer and with whom the Volunteer meets at least once a day to clarify daily agenda and objectives. The Volunteer has also a Mentor. The working day lasts 6 hours (with pre-determined routine tea and lunch breaks), weekends are off, so there will be plenty of time to relax, explore the nature, interact with the local community, and enjoy evening activities such as campfires, barbecues and saunas.There will be a regular weekly meeting (tutorial) between the Volunteer and his/her Supervisor. The tutorial has an important function within the volunteering experience where the Volunteer has the opportunity to share ideas and analyses, contribute to the activities with his/her own knowledge and have a say in the project decision-making process. Learning outcomes identified in the beginning of the project will be followed up and recorded regularly during the course of the project which will benefit the accuracy and CV-enhancing value of the final Youthpass that the Volunteer receives.The project will not only raise the Volunteer's awareness and understanding of the importance of maintaining and enhancing the well-being of the environment but through our dissemination activities - via General Ecovillages Network and national ecovillages' events and meetings - introduces the knowledge of how to make decisions that simultaneously consider economical, social and environmental realities to other young people, inspiring them to participate in similar projects.The project impacts positively the inhabitants of Parmu Ecovillage and contributes to the preserving activities of the region's cultural heritage.

The first audience to receive the reports and articles will be the local community. The second audience will be the peace building community in Georgia who can then more generally offer insights from their peace building initiatives in Gori to be extended beyond this area. The third audience are interested parties beyond Georgia \u2013 what lessons can be learned from conflicts in Georgia to improve our knowledge and understanding of conflict resolution, post-conflict reconstruction and peace building. This will be a key part of the plan to disseminate the work of the project through Kartlosi's website and social media, and by forming new partnerships and networks with other NGOs across Europe, especially in the UK.

LET has 50 years\u2019 experience of supporting personal development through challenging and inspiring outdoor activities, including climbing, caving, kayaking and bushcraft, delivered in a safe, supportive environment and led by professional instructors. LET\u2019s work is delivered from two residential centres in the Peak District, and, increasingly, through outreach projects in disadvantaged urban areas. LET is committed to inclusion and is able to adapt many of its activities to support those with additional needs. The organisation also has a bursary fund to enable the participation of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and to support groups that need a higher instructor to client ratio.Objectives:This project aims to \u2022 provide an immersive experience of the outdoor learning sector\u2022 support employability through facilitating the development of the skills, experience and attributes needed to work in the outdoor learning sector \u2022 support the development of range of task-specific skills, informal learning, reflective processes and personal development.  \u2022 support the development of English language skills in a range of real life contexts\u2022 support cultural exchange and understanding and help build ongoing links with organisations across Europe to facilitate exchange of ideas and best practice\u2022 raise awareness of European volunteer opportunities with the young people that LET works with, many of whom are from disadvantaged communities\u2022 increase the number of outdoor activity projects taking part in EVS and other international exchange  programmes.Volunteer Profile:The current project seeks to support one volunteer, an 18-year-old woman from Germany who proactively contacted LET as the receiving organisation and IJGD as the sending organisation. Following an outward bound course, plus voluntary work supervising outdoor activities for children, the volunteer decided she wishes to pursue a career in outdoor education.LET is keen to host more Erasmus and EVS placements in the future, and potentially to act as a sending organisation for some of the many young people they work withActivities and Methodology:Through this project, the volunteer will get involved with all aspects of LET\u2019s work. She will work alongside our instructors and experience all aspects of working in the delivery of outdoor education.  The volunteer will initially observe sessions; as her confidence, competence and experience increases she will have opportunities to lead certain sessions, under supervision, and, potentially, to lead low risk activities by herself. She will have the opportunity to complete LET\u2019s in-house training programme for on-site activities, plus attend relevant National Governing Body training courses for adventurous outdoor activities. She will also learn how to facilitate learning, develop a range of practical guided reflection and reviewing techniques, and gain valuable experience of different learning styles. Whilst these skills and techniques are used in the outdoor education setting they are highly transferable, and highly sought after, in many other industries.LET also works in an outreach capacity with young people in a very deprived area of Greater Manchester. The volunteer will have opportunities to get involved with this programme, supporting the delivery of sessions and hosting discussion with participants.Refection and review are a key part of the programme and the volunteer will be supported in setting and reviewing objectives, and also in identifying the areas of LET\u2019s work in which she is most interested. She will be assigned a Mentor with whom she will have regular review sessions.Results and Impact:The expected impact for the volunteer are the development the competences, values, skills and ability to work with a diverse range of young people in an outdoor education setting, including those with additional needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The benefits for LET include having a fresh perspective on current practices and procedures - the volunteer will be asked to give feedback and suggest improvements. LET will also be able to forge links with European partners to support information exchange and future volunteer placements.Longer term benefit:Dissemination of the programme results will, we hope, encourage more young people to enroll on EVS and Erasmus+ programmes and experience the huge range of benefits these bring.
