Our organisation uses non-formal and informal practices to provide information, advice and practical support through our daytime drop in centre and crisis night shelter.\r\n\r\nFor this project we are providing the opportunity for three participants to undertake an EVS youth mobility placement with us for a period of twelve months.  The participants will be recruited from our two partner organisations, Asociaci\u00f3n Cazalla Intercultural in Spain and 96 Youth Club in Ireland.  \r\n\r\nThe objectives of our project are \r\n\u2022 To provide a varied intercultural experience for our target group service users (young homeless) which provides a European dimension to their situation and the choices they make\r\n\u2022 To enable EVS volunteers to participate as active members of the team at The Base daytime drop in centre, providing advice and activities\r\n\u2022 To enable EVS volunteers to participate as active members of the Emergency night shelter team, providing assessment of need and practical support\r\n\u2022 For EVS volunteers to collaborate with staff and external partners developing training and sharing good practice to promote young people\u2019s social inclusion and well-being\r\n\u2022 For EVS volunteers to develop innovative and improved youth work practices which actively involve young people to address disadvantage through the development of projects and meaningful activities based on the EVS volunteer's skills and interests\r\n\r\nDue to the multiple disadvantages and the chaotic life situations of our service users, the participants that we recruit for this project need to already have a mature and non-judgemental outlook, tolerance of social problems and a desire to help other young people. The ability to cope in a crisis, and someone with diplomatic skills is also beneficial as is a high degree of independence and the ability to thrive on responsibility.\r\n\r\nTheir volunteering experience will take place across both our sites - the day centre drop in and the night shelter for crisis accommodation.   The working methods used will include experiential learning and non-formal education, alongside structured information and training sessions.  These are the basic elements of the main activities that the EVS volunteer will be involved in during their 12 month placement. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Providing advice and support services\r\n\u2022 Assessing individual need and referring to specialist services\r\n\u2022 Project development - creating and delivering activities, including life skills, confidence, self esteem and creative activities\r\n\u2022 Undertaking crisis shelter sleep in shifts\r\n\u2022 Supporting homeless young people with practical tasks including cooking and washing clothes \r\n\u2022 Building relationships through listening and offering appropriate guidance\r\n\u2022 Supporting the team in the delivery of workshops in schools on the prevention of homelessness\r\n\r\nThe project will result in both short and long terms impacts for the participants, for the three partner organisations involved and our homeless young people using the services here at Streetlife. For the participants the impacts include an increase in knowledge and key competencies, enhanced employability and career prospects and a greater cultural awareness and understanding of social inclusion issues.  For the partners, there is the benefits of improved youth work practice taking on board European approaches, a greater understanding of EU policy and practices and recognition of the importance of cultural diversity.  For our own youth homeless target group this project is an effective way of challenging any stereotypes and potentially discriminatory views they may have, providing them with an insight into other cultures and subsequently a means of raising their aspirations.", "http://www.wearestreetlife.org", "The Streetlife Trust Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA105-012433_coordinator"], ["3LQ", "EVolutionS-  Ensuring Quality in EVS", "The Streetlife Trust Ltd", 34507.0, "This training aims to create an inspirational learning space for exchange of experience and good practice.

All activities will be targeted. That means all activities will be organized and structured according to our objectives. Moreover we will focus on the participants' motivation and interest during the training period.

Themes like quality, trust between partners, mutual support, shared values, working on concrete opportunities together and evaluating impact featured regularly. Partners confirmed the intention to continue to grow together, to strengthen the network and for existing and new collaborations to flourish.  Q.U.E.S.T. stands for Quality, Understanding, Evaluation, Support, Trust in E.V.S.

From building a strong partnership, understanding the EVS concept and its importance and to improve the capacity of practical realisation of EVS projects in the frames of Erasmus+, until the support that mentors can provide to volunteers, is long process and with the activities planned we are sure that we can make it as safe as possible for the participants learning.
