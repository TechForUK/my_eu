This project will deliver respective environmental and social sustainability mapping and it will validate a comprehensive exploitation business plan, building on already established end user interest with existing offtake agreements already in place with British Airways. The project plant installed at the source of where the waste arises in BIGA Energie at Hohenstein (Germany) will produce 1,200 ton of jet fuel from 3,482 tonnes of dried organic waste and 1,153 tonnes of waste vegetable oil per year. A subsequent scale-up first commercial plant would be constructed immediately after the project end to produce 25,000 tonnes per year of aviation fuel. The FlexJet project consortium has undoubtedly  bought together the leading researchers, industrial technology providers including airline off takers and renewable energy experts from across Europe, in a combined, committed and dedicated research effort to deliver the overarching ambition. Building and extending from previous framework funding this project is designed to set the benchmark for future sustainable aviation fuel development and growth within Europe and will provide a real example to the rest of the world of how sustainable aviation biofuels can be produced at both large and decentralised scales economically whilst simultaneously addressing social and environmental needs.", 156338.0, 13094022.0, "FlexJET", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_215048_918215484"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["7XY", "Learning Is Fun Europe", "Archbishop Ilsley Catholic School", 102167.0, "Our project, \"LEARNING IS FUN EUROPE\" (LIFE), will encourage a positive emotional response to the times we are living in. To achieve this,  'LIFE\u2019 will involve a range of subjects across the partnership that will work together  to improve the level of key competences and skills of our students, and so, the quality of our schools, through innovative and creative methods of teaching and learning.  The aim is to improve the attainment of young people - especially those at risk of early school leaving and those with poor basic skills.\r\nTo equip them for the future, changing world of work means they must have good ICT skills as well as foreign language flexibility. The project will foster the internationalization of our institutions in order to enhance the international dimension of education for the best of our young people whom we want to be ready to work and share the European experience of life. \r\nFor the teaching staff, it will strengthen the professional profile of teaching through sharing good practice with other European colleagues (those taking part in our project and others met on the e-Twinning Internet platform) resulting in a form of on-going training intended to make us feel more satisfied and happy with our daily work.\r\nOn a broader perspective, our partnership seeks to develop a more positive attitude towards the teaching and learning of languages whilst promoting the linguistic diversity and inter-cultural awareness of the European Union.\r\nThis will be achieved through activities planned collaboratively but led each time by one specific partner. The topic for each activity  will be varied and its duration, with the purpose always being to awaken the interest of the greatest number of students, school staff and others.  To this end, we will use music, caricatures, satire, recycled art, 'happy days', etc.  Each activity will endeavour to use  innovative teaching methodologies such as CLILI, PBL, PIA (individualized learning project), to improve the exchange of good practice among partners but also to give the students a wider experience of learning.\r\nTo ensure cohesion throughout the project, regular meetings will be held to give both students and staff the opportunity to comment on the process, share the results and evaluate each activity.  They will also be used to discuss the next activity, amending as necessary, according to the evolution of our work and affinities.  The short and long term mobilities will enable the students to experience international team-work as well as everyday life in another language and cultural background.  They will need to show initiative, to work in collaboration using new technologies to create products such as DVDs, movies, ... and also long lasting links between the partners.  \r\nThrough the various means - including our website and blog - which will be employed to interest and inform people (at local, regional and national level) of our project, we hope to inspire others to take on similar challenges and ensure the longevity of our work.", "http://www.ilsley.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-BE01-KA201-000855_2"], ["7XY", "European Movement to Be Responsible Active Citizens Everywhere", "Archbishop Ilsley Catholic School", 124302.0, "The EMBRACE (European Movement to Be Responsible Active Citizens Everywhere) project is a direct response to the current happenings in Europe and will seek to promote social, civic and intercultural competences.  It will necessitate and result in intercultural dialogue, the discussion of basic democratic values and fundamental rights in a forum similar to the EU Parliament, whilst giving our students a platform to debate issues such as social inclusion (tolerance vs intolerance) and non-discrimination (human rights).  They will be encouraged to become active citizens through the use of critical thinking skills and media literacy.  The 7 participant schools (Croatia, England, Finland, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain) represent a European journey through democracy and each will add a different dimension/perspective to the project. Through cooperative/collaborative work, the students and adults involved in the project will scrutinise the main principles of a democracy: freedom of speech, political tolerance, accountability, equality, human rights, and, the vital ingredient, citizen participation.    All these aims will be accomplished by first establishing a \u2018Student Voice\u2019 platform (called the European Junior Parliament) in every school in the partnership, not just for the duration of the project but thereafter too.  This will form the \u2018umbrella\u2019 under which the rest of the planned tasks will be conducted, as it is a very useful tool for gauging the mind-set of our learners at a given time. The other activities are the Project Logo, Active Citizen Newspaper Articles (research and posters about Human Rights), Patriotism vs Nationalism (survey, debate and maps of boundary tensions), A short-story about a Long Journey (research on the history of Democracy), Being Human (sharing acts of Kindness), the e-Twinning project \u2018Embrace Art for Humanity\u2019 (study of films and literary texts matching the topics of the project to write collaborative alternative versions), the Human Rights Tree (posters and debate), and In Their Shoes (surveys on the impact of migration and  creation of diaries of migrants). In total, approximately 1,590 students and teachers will be contributing to this project.The main target groups will be those at most risk of being marginalised in our schools and local communities, but the project also intends to focus on the main cohorts who are in danger of becoming xenophobic.  We want to engage our students in the democratic process for it is through their active participation that they will evolve as the rightful citizens of a free society tomorrow. Another indispensable requisite for the success of our project is maintaining regular contact with each other - not just the teachers but also the students.  For this purpose, ICT tools (including social media) will be of paramount importance and with it will come the urgency to safe-guard our youngsters by informing them and their parents of the dangers of the internet.During the transnational meetings the teachers will impart and receive training from each other to ensure that we are updating our own professional portfolios, sharpening our skills and strategies in order to deliver improved teaching to our students.As far as outcomes of the project are concerned, all its activities, training, resources, mobilities, evaluations and dissemination will be visible to everyone via the project website, on e-Twinning and on the \u201cErasmus+ Project Results\u201d platform, available for downloading and adaptation/adoption.", "http://www.ilsley.bham.sch.uk", "Archbishop Ilsley Catholic School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024536_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B27"}
