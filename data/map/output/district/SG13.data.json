Innovative approaches to delivering specialist support services will be explored in two areas:\r\n\r\nTOPIC 1 \"MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR VOCATIONAL EXPERIENCE ABROAD FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH\" It is is widely recognized by experts that the international exchange of young people offers significant opportunities for formal and informal learning. The impementation of this for disadvantaged youth will be the subject of partner contact seminars.  The aim is to explore how opportunities could be offered regularly to young  people as part of external vocational training. \r\n\r\nTOPIC 2 \"EXCHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT OF GOOD PRACTICE IN WORK WITH UNACCOMPANIED YOUNG REFUGEES\".  Young unaccompanied refugees face many practical problems linked to both their situation and their personal perspective. Professionals are keen to support young refugees well, but need support to develop good practice.  High workload often prevents reflection and the development of good practice and new ideas. The partner contact seminars  aim to create an opportunity for an exchange of good practice and the development of innovative approaches.", "http://www.hertsdirect.org", null, "erasmus_2014-3-DE04-KA105-001458_1"], ["8DQ", "Boulevard of Dreams", "HERTFORDSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL", 71905.0, "Young adults are permantely in motion regardless whether they are or aren\u2019t actively engaged in their educational or professional career. They are continually confronted with changes that affect their personal situation and learning process. This requires flexibility, a positive attitude, motivation and perseverance. It is necessary that young adults but especially those with fewer opportunities or NEETs learn to anticipate to the changes in the labor market and society. They have to be motivated to gain: new insights and complementary skills acquired. If this motivation is lacking there is a high risk to establish a social destructive identity and exclusion. As mentioned in section C.1.3 MYT is actively involved in creating a better future for this targetgroup. After a meeting  in Brussel november 2014,  we concluded that in  different European countries, the challenges with NEETs are similair. We met these partners  and we feel that they all bring relevant expertise in the field and that we all face the same challenges. Unemployment, the risks of dropping out school etc. To reduce those risks we decided to co-operate to exchange methods of knowledge and competences with the following objectives:\r\n\r\n- to gain a greater understanding of interconnections between formal and non-formal education, training and the labour market respectively; \r\n- to gain a broader understanding of practices, policies and systems in education, training for NEETs across countries; \r\n- to gain a greater understanding and responsiveness to  cultural and social economical aspects that are triggers for NEETs to be discouraged, unmotivated and uninspired;\r\n- to improve foreign language and intercultural competences;\r\n- to better the quality of our work and activities in favour of  NEETs;\r\n-to share best practices, useful methods and to gain innovative ideas.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to create a method that in cooperation will combat the negative consequences of youngsters in the social and economical depraved areas such as  leaving school with no diploma. Many young people that grow up in these areas inherits an outsider identity/position with a lower potential for inclusion in society/labour market and a high risk to establish a social destructive identity. The project  further aims to exchange methods of knowledge and competences \u2013 and for that reason we consider this Erasmus + project to be a perfect complement. We need to improve the knowledge of methods on how to work with NEETs. \r\n\r\nThe project is designed for youthworkers, projectmanagers and trainers, whom represent youth organisations, local authorities, or work in local governments or other public institutions that have experience in project developement, methods and activities for NEETs. The participants for the training and studyvisits must have relevant experiences with the target group, want to learn and co-create, speak english and must be older then 18 and will be selected by the partner organisations. \r\n\r\n - the participant must be a citizen of one of the Erasmus + programme countries (28 European Union countries + Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey);\r\n- the participant must be able to communicate in English;\r\n- the participant must be willing to learn and work with other people at an international level;\r\n- the participant is interested in projects or working with  NEETs or young adults with fewer opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe activities which will be held are  seminars, training and study visits. The objective  of the first seminar is to discuss similarties, setting inventory and making a selection of avaiblable methodologies. The second seminar aims to review execution and exhange of knowledge by experts. The closing seminar aims to present results, methodology and conclusions. The objective of the training is a lifelong learning, co-creating, exchanges of methodologies and experiences. The aim of the study visits is a lifelong learning, experience of methodology, acquiring knowledge and insight in the backgrounds of non- formal educations Neets, improvement of response to the needs of NEETs and set-up of a collective methodolgy. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact on the participants and participating organisations are:\r\n- they have created a sense of awareness concerning NEETs across European countries and de social economical influences;\r\n- they are more inspired to motivate young adults with fewer oportunities with new methodologies;\r\n- they have a more knowledge of interconnections between formal and  non-formal education, training and the labour market respectively; \r\n- they are more inspired to use a  foreign language; \r\n- they have more knowledge of their own entrepenerial and organizational skills;\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of the project at the local, regional, national and European level is:\r\n1. the project has created a sense of awareness concerning NEETs across European countries;\r\n2. the project has influenced policy and workingmethods concerning NEETs and young adults with fewer opportuni", "http://www.hertsdirect.org", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL02-KA105-000929_1"], ["8PQ", "Vzdel\u00e1vanie bez hran\u00edc", "THE INSTITUTE OF THE MOTOR INDUSTRY", 63794.0, "Our school, as the holder of the Charter of mobility has in detail a \"European school  development planl.\" Its main aims are :\r\n- to prepare graduates for the European labor market in the required quality and the needs of employers\r\n- to provide them with opportunities for the development of language skills and social skills.\r\n P roject \"Education Without Borders\" is the second project implemented after the award of accreditation for our school This means, that it continuous  at the same time realized the project and we will continue to implement the ideas of our strategy.

In many countries, career guidance at school is becoming crucial for preparing students to initiatives of work-based learning and for fostering students' transitions from school to careers and to further learning paths.The quality of career guidance provision at school is based on the qualification of staff, on the tools and resources available for students and teachers, but also on the capacity of schools to establish and empower cooperative relationships with the \"real word\" through the collaboration with other local career guidance services.The project MYFUTURE will improve some of the main factors for ensuring the best quality of career guidance services: the methodological framework, the key skills of practitioners, the information resources and new guidance tools based on ICT.This project will have an impact on the strategic relationships and cooperation among schools and local career guidance systems: in particular, those provided by Public Local Authorities and by Career Services of Higher Education Institutions (HEI).The international consortium is promoted by the University of Camerino in Italy and it includes partners that are engaged in this field, with great experiences and innovative proposals in using and developing new technologies for career education and guidance. The consortium involves 5 territories with different career guidance systems (Italy, England, Holland, Romania and Malta), in order to test the model and the tools in rural, urban, suburban and insular contexts. Starting from a participatory research action, international working groups will develop a coherent set of web tools and devices, with the needed methodological knowledge and with the related open training resources for teachers and practitioners. At least 240 teachers and career guidance practitioners will be involved in the international working groups and in training paths.The main activities of the project includes:- local and international focus groups;- international survey on career guidance at school (emerging needs, models, case studies, tools and web resources)- local and international working groups for the development of the MYFUTURE web platform and e-guidance resources (career database, information, videos, web meeting and web interview, CV on-line, e-portfolio, e-learning paths on CMS for students)- local and international training paths for teachers and creation of the e-learning platform- national pilot actions for testing the models and the web tools- multipliers events- evaluation and exploitation of the project results.This set of project products will foster:- the right of an individualised career guidance for all students;- a qualified support for the preparation of school transitions and work-based learning experiences;- the cooperation among schools and local career guidance services (provided by Universities, Public Employment offices, others local services);- a better allocation (in one shared web platform \"MYFUTURE\") of career guidance resources and services for students;- higher quality standards of career guidance provision at school;- a new training offer and e-learning resources for teachers and practitioners.The main products of the project includes:1 - MY FUTURE - Improving career education and guidance at school.

So far, we have a methodology sections to each worksheet. Later on, we will take out the methodology sections from each worksheet and will create a separate Teacher\u00b4s Guide out of this material.E-learning activities to go with the worksheets- these online activities are for teachers and students to practise the topics and themes of he worksheets in an interactive way. All the e-learning screens are ready in English and are now being translated to other 3 local language versions.15 Flipped classroom videos- these videos are based on the Flipped Classroom Method and are available in English, the other 3 language versions have been translated and are now piloted by sector skills bodies and regulatory bodies \u2013regarding the correct terminology and the content.20 CLIL Worksheets  with their own methodology- all the 20 worksheets for English in automotive using the CLIL method are available in English version, 10 worksheets have been translated and piloted to CZ, SK and HU, the rest is being translated and piloted.LMS User Manual- this manual of how to use the LMS environment where all the learning material and e-learning activities of the project are placed is now being prepared and will be finalized after the development of the e-learning materials.Online picture and sound based dictionary- this dictionary is being created under guidance of our partner school Holice that has been preparing a list of key words for each worksheet in English together with its translation to the other 3 project languages. As soon as all worksheets and other learning materials have been piloted (expected by December 2018), we will use the template for this interactive dictionary and will work on it. We have had such an online dictionary tool from our previous projects, which means we only need to put the vocabulary there with pictures and have it recorded by native speakers in 4 languages (EN, CZ, SK, HU).Teacher Trainings- not only do we develop innovative learning material, we also focus on teaching the teachers to work with such innovative material to be able to use them in an optimal way. So far we have trained all country mentors, teacher trainers at project schools and we have done several trainings for teachers from non-partner schools. Also, we have prepared some online webinars for any teachers interested- these webinars have not been placed on the project website yet as they need to be technically amended by an expert on video and sound.", null, null, "erasmus_575014-EPP-1-2016-1-CZ-EPPKA2-SSA_2"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["8DE", "Hertfordshire Technical Assistance", "Hertfordshire LEP", "This is a technical assistance project designed to support the delivery of the England National ERDF Operational Programme in the Hertfordshire LEP area.  \nThe primary purpose of the project is to raise awareness of ERDF funding opportunities within the LEP area and support the development of pipeline projects intended to meet the strategic objectives of Hertfordshire LEP as set out in the Hertfordshire ESIF Strategy and Strategic Economic Plan", "ERDF", 212297.0, 424594.0, "erdf_england_13"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SG13"}
