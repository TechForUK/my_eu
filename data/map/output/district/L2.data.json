The purpose was to promote operational and technical collaboration. The 21-member consortium ran between June 2011 and May 2014.\n\nProject partners devised two sustainable means of achieving its objectives. First was the European Maritime Collaboration Portal (EMCP), a website enabling industry members to collaborate. The EMCP offers a searchable database listing innovative services and technologies, their providers and opportunities for collaboration such as tender calls. Users may build partnerships according to their needs and resources.\n\nThe project's second solution was the Technical Collaboration Platform (TCP). This provided an integrating and coordinating environment, supporting design and engineering software tools such as computer-aided design and computational fluid dynamic. The core functionality was the web-based ticket system, enabling automated online computation. Such mechanism is cheaper and more efficient than conventional solutions.\n\nEUROVIP prepared six case studies showing how EMCP and TCP benefit the maritime industry. Two operational-level examples illustrated effective use of the EMCP for finding tender calls and potential collaborators. Further examples illustrated TCP use for novel online computation services and for collaborative design work.\n\nDissemination activities included a project roadshow, and a series of events held across Europe. Such events expanded the participating membership almost 10-fold, and the pool of EMCP users increased from 30 to over 200.

However, rather than assessing the ship performance in terms of global design factors such as ship motions and noise, the human element studies have primarily focused on local design features (e.g., bridge design) that are relatively easy to fix and tune towards required effects on the crew. From the formal point of view, the key element that has been missing and therefore preventing the integration of the human element into ship design projects is a comprehensive quantification of crew performance failure. Given the natural uncertainty of the maritime environment, such quantification must be probabilistic and therefore commensurate with safety-driven ship design methods such as the Risk-Based Design.\n\nIn project FAROS, the rationalised nature of the Risk-Based Design will be used to integrate the human element into the ship safety framework and deliver ship concepts (ro-pax and tanker) that are safe, economic and \u201cgreen\u201d. This will be achieved by (1) quantitatively linking global design factors to the crew performance failure modes (fatigue, gross and fine motor skills etc.) and (2) optimising multi-disciplinary ship performance using state-of-the-art tools, methods and empirical knowledge.\n\nIt is expected that the societal and personal risks on tanker and ro-pax ships can be reduced at least by 30%, provided recommended amendments to design rules are implemented and the developed ship design assessment framework, which takes into account the crew performance at sea, is used in daily ship design practice by parties relevant.", 379319.0, 3107932.0, "FAROS", "Exploring and quantifying the link between ship design and human performance failure", "The design of a ship can adversely affect human performance, which may lead to maritime accidents.

Building on previous projects, the overall goal is to demonstrate how human error aboard a ship can be mitigated by its design. The project specifically focuses on early design stages such as concept design, for drastic design modifications at this stage can still be cost effective.\n\nDuring the first reporting period, the work began with analysis of state-of-the-art research in the GDF influence to crew performance and human error. Findings showed that noise, vibration and ship motions affect attention management capability, while the layout of the deck and the location and accessibility of equipment influence the efficiency and safety of performing various tasks by crew.\n\nResearchers quantified risk contributions from such casualties as crew injury and death, ship-to-ship collision, grounding, and fire that affect the entire ship and hence all people onboard. Risk models were then developed linking GDFs to human performance and errors. The models were combined to create a comprehensive risk assessment framework to be used for passenger and cargo ships in a risk-based design process.\n\nVirtual experiments were carried out in machinery spaces (simulated in virtual reality) and on bridge simulators to determine the conditions under which the crew is most likely to fail. These conditions were then compared to corresponding design rules and guidelines, looking for relevant deficiencies and loopholes.\n\nWith a better understanding of the causal link between ship design and human performance, FAROS will offer improvements to ship design process that will lead to safer ships.

How to support civil courage within your youth projects, Tulln July 2016 supported by the European Youth foundation)These trainings were based on the individual possibilities how to react in a situation where civil courage is needed. The success of the previous courses and the political issues all over Europe showed the urgent need for civil courage.  As a next step we would like to work on how youth organizations can run campaigns on the subject of civil courage as the external trainers and the participants found that this was a missing element for which we did not find the space in the already held trainings. Youth organisations and civil society can play a very powerful and important role in society. Our training courses in 2015 showed that the concept of civil courage is very new to most of the youth organisations and still not known everywhere. Some languages even lack a word for it. The need for this training course is very much connected with the \u201ccivil and courageous\u201d values and attitudes that young people and youth worker in organizations carry. For this reason, we will focus on participants learning process touching important elements as integrity, participation, critical thinking, self-esteem, dialogue in order to empower them to start campaigns according to their countries and working realities. Furthermore we would like to use the chance to create a Manual on Civil courage methodologies to allow also other organisations to use the methods developed and explored during the 3 civil courage trainings and to spread it.Civil courage essentially describes two things: a person\u2019s courage to speak out in the public sphere, and readiness to stand up and help their fellow citizens in time of need. Ones ability to judge and act upon civil courage comes when one clearly senses injustice. Sometimes just the use of the word \"civil courage\" can have a liberating effect on someone with a sense for it.But not only individuals can speak out, also organisations can raise their voices and change injustice in their environment through different channels. Campaigning can be one of them and we would like to explore the possibilities together with all involved partner organisations. We intend to organize a 5-day training course on how to plan and implement civil courage campaigns within each organisations context. The training is aimed for youth workers or active members of the participating organizations.Aims and Objectives\uf0b5 To promote and teach civil courage within youth organisations and give youth workers tools to implement them \uf0b5 To share methods on how to encourage youth workers and members of youth organizations to stand up for their own beliefs\uf0b5 To experiment with different methods of campaigning (facebook, flashmob, action day, dance in public,\u2026.)\uf0b5 To sensitize  on situations where civil courage is needed \uf0b5 To give youth workers within their organisations methods on how to design civil courage campaigns through their members and participants\uf0b5 To give participants and youth organisations involved in international voluntary projects or other youth projects tools to stand up against racism and unequality \uf0b5 to get inspired by practical examples and organisations working in Vienna Grenzenlos has an inclusion focus within all our programs.

As the adults of tomorrow, young people will shape the future. They will determine whether the nascent racism and xenophobia witnessed throughout the European Union takes a stronger hold or retreats into obscurity. \r\nThrough an exchange of one week we want to address different topics to carry out a reflection on what is multiculturalism, how we can build coexistence in Europe and face problems and fears emerged in our society in recent years.
