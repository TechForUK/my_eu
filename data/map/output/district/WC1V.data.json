The most common cause of UI is called the Overactive bladder syndrome (OABS) of which the underlying complex bio-molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Many distinct tissues (nervous system, urothelium, interstitial cells, smooth muscle cells) contribute to OABS but their specific roles remain unknown. As a result, no effective non-invasive therapy without side effects is available or can be developed without a profound integration of multiple scientific disciplines. The TRUST ITN proposes an interdisciplinary research training network of 8 European university institutes and 3 enterprises, with a wide variety of complementary expertise in UI and OABS. The network covers all required disciplines from anatomy, urology, neuroscience, pathology, pharmacology, biomedical engineering, clinical science, bioinformatics to diagnostic- and drug development, that must be applied on cellular-, organ- and whole body levels. Currently most researchers are not trained to deal with such a great variety of disciplines, and are thus insufficiently prepared to cope with the modern and increasingly urgent challenges of urology research. In the TRUST project 10 early stage researchers and 5 experienced researchers will receive training from different leading European research institutes on multiple complementary disciplines that will empower them to explore the and unravel the mechanisms underlying OABS and to develop novel diagnostic, prevention and treatment strategies.

They looked at how to develop and test a new production model involving different small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that can work together as microfactories under one network. The new business model was conceived to provide trust, choice and service to consumers and suppliers, meeting the needs and requirements of both.\n\nIn this spirit, SERVIVE revealed that the three most promising market niches are knitwear, sportswear and women's business wear. It then defined customisation options and developed several product configuration paradigms for different project partners to meet their needs. Work also involved integrating customer support functions, style advice for customers and virtual try-on capabilities that involved 3D representation.\n\nTo help launch this vision, SERVIVE built an http://community.servive.eu (online portal and community) that lets consumers buy mass-customised clothing items from different suppliers. The platform enables them to build their own profile and virtual twin, with the capability to show configured products to friends as well.\n\nConsumers are set to benefit significantly from the flexibility of buying customised clothes online as the market for produced-on-demand apparel grows exponentially.

To be able to understand we need to share stories, opinions, feelings and facts, we need to meet at a common ground where curiosity and creativity are our weapon of choice and all prejudice is left at the door. \r\n\r\nHere we are going to look into the role of the society in our individual personal journeys and how it differs from the different countries within Europe. During these days we will dig into and discuss the different society constellations, how we are moulded by them, the effect it has on our individual self image and our collective image as youth in Europa. What is our generation like and why? How do we differ from each other and what role do we have where we come from in the differentiation?\r\n\r\nYou can try to change the world but the chance is that you won\u2019t be heard, you can try to change a country but the chance is that it won\u2019t listen. You can try to change your town, but the chance is that you will create more enemies then friends, you can try to chance your family but the chance is that you will make them feel insecure and not worthy. But if you start by changing your self and try to be the best version of what you are, the chances are that you will influence and inspire the people around to do the same, which then will influence and inspire the people around them to do the same and in the end you may have changed your town, you may have changed your whole country and in fact you may have chanced the world. \r\n\r\nIn order to improve the society we live in it needs to change, and all change starts with the individual.

qualifications to enhance their mobility. At the heart of the development process towards achieving these declared aims lie the structuring and execution of additional international mobility projects.\r\n\r\nOur three-week Business Communication Competence project in London has a number of core elements \u2013 acquiring intercultural competence through pertinent language seminars, the completion and presentation of a team project highlighting professional language fluency. It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing. For trainees and teaching staff alike this should enable an international exchange of outlooks \u2013 not necessarily in English alone. Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017. Along with concentration on the theme of International Commerce, the English KMK Certificate Level B1, qualification in a further foreign language at minimum Level A1 and the ECDL, a three-week work placement abroad with intercultural interaction is also required. For this we have the partners Liverpool and ECBM with their great experience. The europass will be issued for this.\r\n\r\nSending staff to support participants has definitely enhanced the success and quality of our Mobility projects to date and further strengthened the Internationalisation awareness of accompanying staff. Our expanding concept for Mobility involves intensifying the participation of staff in project activities. They will have the added opportunity for comparing international approaches to vocational training and an exchange on didactics with their opposite numbers in vocational institutions. The ensuing reflection and multiplication of their experiences in various locations will promote the internationalisation of our college.", "http://www.berlitz.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-DE02-KA116-004068_3"], ["7EY", "Gi-Baj-Mo2", "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS LONDON", 205682.0, "With the project GBM 2 Gospodarska \u0161kola from \u010cakovec continues to fulfil the goals set in Development plan and Internationalisation Strategy.  For this year the Plan predicts 100 mobilities, 80 mobilities for students and 20 mobilities for vocational teachers.In the analysis of application for getting Erasmus+ VET  Mobility Charter it was stated that the planned number is appropriate for the size and experience of our institution. As suggested by our national agency we reduced the predicted number of mobilities for vocational teachers from 20 to 9 and we increased the predicted number of students\u2019 mobilities from 80 to 91. Consequently, we reached the number of 100 planned mobilities. Except for the mobilities financed by EU funds, we plan to organise 8 students\u2019 mobilities with our own funds (zero grant) which also contributes to achieving the goal.\r\nIn the project GBM 2 Gospodarska \u0161kola will cooperate with 13 foreign partners. 6 of the foreign partners are educational institutions and 7 of them are business entities. The cooperation in this project will be continued with the 9 partners we have already worked with and 4 new partners. As for the organisation of the professional practice for students, the focus is still on establishing cooperation with the economic sector. For 83 students the practical training will be taking place in the economic entities and for 8 students the practical training will be held in workshops of partner schools. This will bring our institution closer to the labour market which is one of the priorities of Development Plan and Internationalisation Strategy. Vocational training for 62 students is predicted to last 2 weeks for students of final grades and one month for 29 students who are finishing their education. This brings us closer to reaching the goal set in the Strategy which says that by 2020 all the students of our school will have an opportunity to go on a two-week vocational training during their education or a long term training upon graduation. The professional practice includes students from all the sectors and professions and we are proud to be able to include students with disabilities and special needs in the mobilities.\r\nThis project will not only enable mobilities of the students but also the professional development through mobility for 8 vocational teachers. All the professional developments are related to the field of vocational courses and will take place in reputable partners with Erasmus + VET Mobility Charter and world known university. The professional development of our teachers will be done through participation in the educational process of the receiving institutions and through attending specialised courses related to field of study of teachers and their jobs in our school. The plans of teachers\u2019 professional development are attached to this application.\r\nThe mobility of students and teachers implements the principle of excellence stated in our Internationalisation Strategy. \u201cThrough international activities Vocational School endeavours:\r\n- to enable students to gain professional and personal knowledge, skills and competences which will enable them to be equally competitive in the European and global labour markets.\r\n- to enable teachers and expert associates to gain insight into education systems of other countries and to have the opportunity of permanent education in acquiring new technologies and applying them in teaching.\u201d\r\nThe project application was done according to the interest expressed in a poll conducted among the future participants and according to the needs determined by the Erasmus+ project team. \r\nSince education in our school lasts mainly for three years, majority of the students that go on mobilities are minors. Furthermore the greatest number of mobilities will take place in business organisations. The students\u2019 mobilities include students with disabilities and special needs students and business companies can only receive a few of them at one time. Those are the reasons why it is necessary to send accompanying teachers with our students to their mobilities. We attempt to reduce the number of accompanying teachers or the length of stay for them. Still, we do not want to jeopardise the quality of the mobility.  \r\nBecause of the structure of our students to whom the mobility is almost always  the first time being abroad and the fear of parents for their children not being able to take care of themselves without adults, I believe that the number of accompanying teachers are necessary and justified.", "http://www.arts.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HR01-KA116-035154_10"], ["6LF", "S.E.A.S. - Study, Employment, Activities for students", "Citadine Holborn", 458579.0, "The project \"S.E.A.S. - Study, Employment, activities for student\" originates from the synegistic collaboration between the I.T.E.T. \"Leonardo da Vinci\"of Milazzo, and other involved schools, training centers and assocations in the Consortium with a network of foreign partners in the countries of destination of mobility.These partners,that were identified through the support of some European platforms, such as eTwinning,will both host the 80 learners and put them in some apprenticeship programmes  in companies that operate in the same sector of their own education  before departing.\r\nIn a region such as Sicily, where despite the increase of the PIL and a growth in certain sectors such as tourism and export,the employment rate is still experiencing a slow growth and data on the poverty of the families are still worrying. In this context,the project wants to represent a piece of the mosaic of the qualitative development of excellence of the territory, i.e. of all areas affecting the spinneret of the sea,focusing on what is defined Blue Economy then. The aim is to train experts that can focus on the above-mentioned setting, creating new opportunities for innovative and sustainable growth,through new standards and best practices.It is important specifically:\r\nTo enhance skills and competencies of learners in the following sectors: tourist, commercial and nautical,in the three macro-areas of the supply-chain of the sea, to cover the needs of the professional profiles that are  required in this field and to encourage a greater extension of the Blue Economy in Sicily;Strengthen language skills; Strengthen useful knowledge for the creation of new business realities.\r\n80 beneficiaries will be split into two flows of mobility and the mobility will affect  following countries:France,United Kingdom, Belgium and Malta,where indeed it will be possible to also improve their language skills, taking advantage of mobility in order  to learn two of the most spoken languages in the world:english and french. \r\nThe project,which last for 24 months and it will be oriented to new graduates of Technical and Vocational Sicilian Institutes,who will have  achieved their high school degree  in the following addresses: Tourist, Hospitality and Tourism,Transportation and Logistic Commercial.The selection will take place with the support of an examination board who will evaluate the profiles of the individual at first according to what concerns both the linguistic skills and motivation. In order to draw up the final ranking  it will be necessary to involve also some foreign bodies, in order to make the choice  fall again  on  some candidates who have suitable profiles with the job opportunities offered by companies that will be identified for the internship.During the whole period of the project, all involved actors will work all together , sharing decisions,planning activities,monitoring the entire path, to reach a final evaluation, not only according to the experience of the candidates but according to the impacts too that SEAS  will have  both on them and on the territory. The project originated, in fact,from the desire to increase the opportunities for professional growth of learners through a working experience that can allow them to be in touch with the different social-cultural realities  but also with a concept of both living and working  in a different way.The intent is to let them get both a know-how and some good practices  to be internalized  and brought back when returnng in Italy,in order to use them then for their own professional future and for a greater development of the territory.\r\nThe project will have an impact not only on the current education of beneficiaries but also on the proponent and on members of the Consortium that will give life to new contacts with local and foreign companies and they will  both extend their network of schools and stimulate the staff to subscribe to European platforms in order to communicate with colleagues to share good practices and to increase the  visibility through the Erasmus mobility.\r\nIn a short term period  the project aims to generate,at least for the 70% of learners,the possibility to continue the work that  began   with the internship abroad and it wants to reserve a fast track because of searching  of employment for  beneficiaries,succeeding to ensure then some  proposals for further placements when returning from mobility abroad.\r\nIn addition,the dissemination step will alert not only the entire school community,but also families, institutions, agencies,local businesses and stakeholders,bringing the results in terms of learning outcomes and good practices in the tables of comparison and to the attention of professionals related to the world of education and vocational training, in order to match  more training courses with the labor market.", "http://www.citadines.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA102-006280_20"], ["7EY", "CU@ARCUS!", "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS LONDON", 109060.0, "Arcus College is a vocational institution which is located at short distance from Germany and Belgium and because of the geographical location of Arcus we can act as a hub for educational institutions within Europe.

In addition, we want to offer the teachers and students of our partner schools the same opportunities. \r\n\r\nWhich methods will we use to achieve this? \r\n\r\n\u2022 Agreements with partner organizations \r\n\r\n\u2022 Exchanging and deploy each other's internship network \r\n\r\n\u2022 Helping each other with housing \r\n\r\n\u2022 Strong commitment to job shadowing \r\n\r\n\u2022 Focus on social inclusion (students with different backgrounds, profiles, educational level or physical disability) \r\n\r\n\u2022 Focus on mastering a foreign language  \r\n\r\nFor this project there is a need to facilitate 190 students who differ in level 2, 3 and 4 to have a short or long-term internship in Europe. In this group, extra attention is paid to level 2 students and students with a physical disability. \r\n\r\nIn the context of professional development, there is a need to offer training, seminars and job shadowing for 86 teachers. \r\n\r\nDue to a promotional campaign from the internationalisation department, there is more demand from students and teachers to go abroad. In order to guide this increase in the right direction, it is important to offer good support in the form of information and organizing activities. \r\n\r\nWith this support, various activities have been set up so that departments engaged in contact with various schools in Europe over the past year. \r\n\r\n\u2022 That resulted in an idea from the hairdressing department to organize job shadowing at Coleg Cambria with several teachers and to exchange traineeships between each other. \r\n\r\n\u2022 With CEF Mallorca we agreed to set up a study program to exchange students and teachers. \r\n\r\n\u2022 School workers who are deployed at Arcus have applied for the Emotional Intelligence training that is given in Barcelona. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Several schools from Spain have asked us to help find suitable internships in the region and offer support in exchange programs, they are also committed that they will offer the same service for our students and teachers. \r\n\r\nThe result we strive for with this project is that after completing an international internship, a student will become wiser, more responsible and more independent and thus more likely to enter the labour market. This international experience should also ensure that a student becomes more understanding with other cultures. For teachers we strive that they share their gained experiences with colleagues and use them during lessons. \r\n\r\n The impact which we want to achieve is that teachers and students take on an ambassador role when they return and motivate others to think and act without borders and broaden their horizon with a European mindset. \r\n\r\nOur long term aim is to: \r\n\r\n- build strategic partnerships. \r\n\r\n- Bring students and teachers within the European Union closer together. \r\n\r\n- Let the students experience that the European Union knows no borders \r\n\r\n- and that all the students with their international experience can be of added value for the companies in the region.  \r\n\r\nWe as Arcus College are convinced that with our enthusiasm, motivation and passion we will ensure that this project will be valuable, sustainable and the necessary impact for all parties for the European Union.", "http://www.arts.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038808_18"], ["7EY", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS LONDON", 703658.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.arts.ac.uk", "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS LONDON", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047154_coordinator"], ["7JZ", "Resources for Education in Valuation Standards in Europe", "Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation", 206843.0, "The project is the result of an initiative for joint cooperation between the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers in Ireland in cooperation with the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation (UK), both of which are fully utilising the standards in their training and professional practice. \r\n\r\nThe European Group of Valuers' Associations (TEGoVA) represents 44 Valuer Associations from every country in Europe. It has published European Valuation Standards for a number of years, the seventh edition will be published in September 2015. EVS 2015, or the Blue Book as it is known, will be a professional practice manual which is effectively a summary of the accumulated knowledge and experience of European practice and valuation.  However, it does not provide practical information on how to conduct a property valuation and most certainly does not contain material which could be used in a training context. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop learning material which will be used both in a training context and as a guide for professional practice in the industry.

This will result in a potential audience of over 140,000 individual practitioners. \r\n\r\nIn the short term, it is expected that project will immediately make available to those above a comprehensive training resource pack which will enhance the understanding and the application of the European Valuation Standards.\r\nIn the long term, the product will be embedded in to each of the 44 Valuer Associations.  This will enable the members of those organisations to access the system either manually or electronically.  \r\n\r\nAs well as the impacts outlined above, the outputs from the project will further enhance the understanding of the European Valuation Standards across the whole of Europe and will increase their application in order to meet the various directives on valuation processes. The impact of these standards will also improve the \u201csafety net\u201d which will ensure that appropriate economic indicators are properly considered in all property valuations thus reducing the possibility of the economic chaos which engulfed European countries in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe skills acquired as a result of the resource pack will give participants the knowledge and understanding of the European Valuation Standards which will improve their competence as Valuers and impact on the quality of their valuations.  Consequently this will enhance the status of the individual in the work place and improve there opportunities for the development of their skills and thus offer wider work opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop and enhance the overall understanding and application of the European Valuation Standards across the whole of Europe and the wider use of the standards will be an inevitable outcome of this wider understanding.  This will in turn increase the number of policy areas in which the standards will become influential.  This will be particularly evidenced in the property market where a transnational approach for valuation is important to ensure consistent transacting of properties across borders. \r\n\r\nLooking further ahead the establishment of the standards will provide cross border consistency in the practice and delivery of valuations of land and buildings which will assist the customer of the valuation process.", "http://www.irrv.net", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IE01-KA202-008672_2"], ["7JZ", "Valuer Access to Recognised Vocational Education and Training", "Institute of Revenues, Rating & Valuation", 104206.0, "The purpose of this project is to invest resources in the development of a new Europe wide foundation vocational training and qualifications network based on IRRV's vocational training framework for real estate valuation training in UK.   IRRV is an accrediting awarding body for vocational qualifications in the UK by the main government sponsored national accreditation body, which means that its education department can organise and award its own qualifications.  It is therefore is an excellent position to lead a project to deliver a trans-European vocational qualification in real estate valuer training which has eluded all previous attempts to establish at this level a genuine transparent international qualifications regime in valuation across Europe.  There is a desire by all partners to make this happen because more and more valuation business is becoming international by nature and larger clients are demanding that valuers are appropriately qualified. Whilst most countries have full professional qualifications linked to cognate degrees, the marketplace lacks a foundation vocational qualification for valuation, so that people with lower level qualifications along with groups such as returnees to work and socially disadvantaged have the opportunity obtain training and certification . The aim of the project is to deliver such a qualification using European VET initiatives with an objective to deliver a training and certification which can be recognised across the partners and ultimately across Europe.   No comparable training is currently available in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the consortium that will implement the proposal are that they are six professional bodies in separate countries that are concerned with delivering an effective and ethical expertise in valuation that will serve the economies of each of the countries. Very few of the new Member States, including those which joined in 2004 and 2007, have a sufficiently developed infrastructure to devise and implement a foundation qualification in valuation.  However, change is happening at a very rapid pace and Eastern European associations can now make meaningful contributions to such a project.\r\n     \r\nThe tangible outcome will be the creation of a series of modules which will form the basis of a trans-European training and qualifications regime which will create in each participating partner country the opportunity for people wishing to develop their valuation skills and assist cross border mobility of those with these skills.  The intangible outcomes will be the creation of trans national skills amongst other professionals in related sectors who wish to obtain a foundation level certificate in a key element of the European economy.  The intention is to deliver ultimately a solution to valuation training in all member states, where there is a combined footprint of 145,000 valuers, together with other professionals, such as those working in financial services and local government, who will be impacted by this project. \r\n\r\nThe impact envisages an improvement in basic real estate valuation education and training and the creation of a workforce that will benefit from the application of principles of mutual recignition to deliver a consistent understanding of the foundation principles of real estate valuation.", "http://www.irrv.net", "Institute of Revenues, Rating & Valuation", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013778_coordinator"], ["7EY", "Achieving and ReTrieving Creativity through European fashion Cultural HERitage Inspiration", "THE UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS LONDON", 132107.0, "The European textile industry has always been keen to preserve representative examples of textile production of the past, either for creative or for educational purposes.

Many firms have also acquired whole archives or textile samples from other sources.Over the last few decades, the economic crisis which has affected the European textile sector has resulted in the loss of many textile archives. Indeed the failure of businesses and the consequent closure of their warehouses has caused the loss of hundreds of textile samples and designs. In order to avoid breaking the line of continuity which joins past and future textile production - a fundamental feature of European excellence in the fashion sector - it is necessary for museums, cultural institutions and textile companies to protect our textile heritage.The project objective is to both to to contribute to the protection and exploitation of the fashion Cultural Heritage and organize and structure it in vocational training courses for the improvement of EU fashion designers (Fashion designers working in T&A Industries and young fashion designers).

Whilst fashion is a global industry offering livelihoods to 50+ million people, generating over \u20ac2.4 trillion, its practices are built on systems that are causing severe environmental and social damage. The societal impact of the industry is a contentious issue due to working practices and the wider impact of fashion production and consumption. The industry is oft-cited as being the second most environmentally polluting industry in the world; due to its contribution to water stress and its pollution, biodiversity loss, CO2 emissions, chemical and material waste, air pollution and non-renewable energy use. The economic sustainability of the industry is additionally at risk, as fashion design practices do not take account of the diminishing resources upon which the industry relies. Fashion industry requires new models of education and environments for innovation, revised course content, assessment methods and the means for tutors to develop new knowledge and practices. \r\n \r\nWhilst sustainability education courses exist in some disciplinary areas, desk based research identifies that very few universities with design courses internationally engage with fashion for sustainability teaching and learning in systematic or cross-referenced ways. Furthermore, there is a lack of design teachers with the relevant knowledge and capabilities to deliver fashion sustainability education. \r\n \r\nThe 3-year FashionSEEDS project aims to develop a holistic framework for design-led fashion education for sustainability applied across levels, courses and locations in the consortium higher education institutions, incorporating course content, teaching & learning practices & methodologies, tools & resources and  learning environments. \r\n \r\nThe project will produce a benchmarking report (O1) to align knowledge and build a context reference for designing an innovative and robust design-led sustainability framework for fashion education that will span from undergraduate to postgraduate teaching and learning (O2).
