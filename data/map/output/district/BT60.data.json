Wikispaces,  blogs and websites will be used  in order to make learning more engaging and attractive for all the pupils in schools.\r\nTeachers will plan ICT-enhanced lessons that can be used in any subject context  through the selection of appropriate ICT for lesson preparation, teaching- learning -assessment activities and will share them with partners. Communication through the use of new media will be enhanced either for staff  involved and children with their parents (Wikispace -www.wikispaces.com; Blogs  newsletter ; videoconferences; Twitter-Facebook -Skype- Google Drive-Youtube ) . Eight schools from different parts of Europe will be involved: Italy(2) , Bulgaria , Romania, Turkey, UK (Northern Ireland) , Poland., Greece.  Most of the key persons have good experience, competences and skills on the subject. \r\nAim of this project will be also to promote equity and inclusion facilitating the access to learning to those from disadvantage backgrounds and fewer opportunities. A strong focus will be on collaborative, cooperative and peer learning in order to involve all pupils, even those with special needs,  in the process of learning.\r\nWe will make use of OER (Open educational resources) to improve the quality of education, knowledge sharing and capacity building.\r\nOf course, when using the Net we have to take in consideration  e-safety  and the so called \u201cNetiquette\"; pupils, parents and teachers should raise their awareness  and be educated on this subject to avoid misuse or cyberbullying. All partners  will take part in Safer Internet day  organizing special activities in each school (http://www.saferinternet.org ) and surfing on special websites on the subject (http://www.childnet.com ).\r\nThrough this project we expect to develop teachers competences  in   how to integrate ICT into teaching practice in a collaborative and sustainable way and to help students to avoid abuses on the Internet or improper use of the net giving them the right tools to navigate in a safe, proper and healthy way. \r\nIn this way we hope they could be lifelong learners and understand the great potential of the Net as a means to realize this goal.", "http://www.armaghcbs.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT02-KA201-003291_2"], ["4BJ", "An Investigation into Immigration within the European Union", "Saint Catherine's College", 44985.0, "Context/Background of the project\r\nThe background to this project lies in the most recent wave of immigration to the European Union and the movement of citizens within the EU-27. Recent unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has seen thousands of refugees make the attempt to gain access to the European Union in order to seek a better life for themselves. This has lead to many deaths as in desperation those who are in most need will attempt the most riskiest of passages in order to escape persecution, war and famine. Combined with this wave of immigration has been the movement of workers within the European Union, most notably from new accession states in search of jobs and economic advantage. In many host countries this has lead to tensions with some questioning the rationale behind EU immigration policy. \r\n\r\nAs immigration rates to the EU rise with current world events within founding member states of the European Union there has been a rise in 'Race Hate' crime combined with attacks on what are seen as one of the core principles of the European Union, that is the Freedom of speech and expression i.e. Charlie Hebdo attacks. Commentators have said that the European Union has become too big and should effectively close it's door's to immigrants, while within the European Union, in some member states, there has been a growing sense of nationalism and drive for self determination. \r\n\r\nWithin this social and political context there lies a need for open and honest discussion about the impact of immigration on host and  home countries, a need to examine how immigrants have integrated. \r\n\r\nEach of the project partners mentioned within come from a different socio-economic and political background and it is with these project partners that we aim to openly discuss through the medium of film the true impact of immigration within the EU.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the Project\r\nKey objectives include the promotion of Tolerance, Respect, Diversity, Perception and Inclusion.\r\nEnhancement of the ideals of the European Union and Scared Heart Education.\r\nDevelopment of transnational skills for Employability\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\n4 Project Partners from across the EU have been identified\r\n3 of the Partners have experience of working on European Projects\r\nStrong Leadership teams and core teams have been established \r\nExcellent ICT support is available to the lead school and partner school\r\nThe Project will be carried out with 30 16/17 year old pupils' in each partner school.\r\n\r\nDescription of Activities\r\nTransnational meetings (target setting, sharing good practice, planning and review)\r\nDigital Storytelling Workshop\r\nGuest speakers from Political groups, N.G.O's, local and national Charities\r\nCulture Days\r\nInterviews with minority groups\r\nArmagh Film Festival\r\nDebates/Question and Answer sessions about immigration\r\nPoster and Postcard campaigns\r\nCreation of Blog re: Immigration\r\nExhange and Collaboration on using Social Media\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology used\r\nSMARTER targets, RACI matrix, SWOT analysis\r\nMix of qualitative and quantitative assessment\r\nCore Teams in each school \r\nTimetable of activities\r\nRegular monitoring, dissemination and communication\r\nRelationship building combining ICT methodologies (skype/ Blog/ Podcast) and visits\r\n\r\nDescription of Results/Impact and Benefits\r\nDevelop transversal skills in participants - particularly in the area of Digital Literacy\r\nHigher inter cultural awareness\r\nHigher interest, tolerance and respect for other countries, cultures and people.\r\nHave a greater knowledge of the reasons for immigration, the causes and consequences\r\nHave an understanding of EU formation, objectives and expansion\r\nHave a better knowledge about living/ school life in other countries\r\nEstablish personal contacts with pupils from cross sector and partner schools through ICT and mobilities\r\nBuild on the desire to travel and explore new places\r\nDevelop social skills and the ability to work in teams\r\nRaise awareness within the local community about local minority groups with whom interviews and films are being made.\r\nLocal minority community involved in Culture Days\r\nNationally minority groups will be involved in postcard and poster campaigns\r\nProject discussed and modeled as 'best practice' with other schools at local level\r\nProject discussed with other schools internationally (that are part of the Sacred Heart Network) and modeled as 'best practice' at the European and International Heads and Deputes meetings.\r\nNews coverage at a National level will have a wide impact in forming peoples opinions and views.\r\nLobby and advocate for a change in Laws\r\nLobby in order to change views and perceptions\r\nCreation of films which provoke, inspire, enthuse and cause people to examine their perception of immigration and immigrants", "http://www.stcatherinesarmagh.com", "Saint Catherine's College", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA219-013730_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT60"}
