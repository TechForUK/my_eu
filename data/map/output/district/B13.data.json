The global LAB market is expected to grow by 59% to \u20ac71.6 billion by 2022 with Europe accounting for the second largest market share. Waste LAB recycling rates are as high as 95% in Europe, but the current recycling process \u2013 smelting waste LABs in a furnace \u2013 consumes vast quantities of energy, is highly polluting, wasteful, large scale and expensive. Furthermore, smelted lead must be further processed to produce the essential LAB ingredient: the active lead oxide paste. A new lead recycling process is needed that is energy efficient, non-polluting, low cost, scalable and produces LAB-ready lead products. Such process would meet EC priorities by addressing resource efficiency, the sustainable supply of raw materials and drive the circular economy. AEL has developed a novel hydrometallurgical process technology to recycle waste LABs in a highly energy efficient, non-polluting and cost effective way. NUOVOpb\u2019s commercial appeal lies in its low cost and scalability, and our ground-breaking ability to produce LAB-ready products that exceed the performance of current products on the market. Our LAB-ready paste can create new LABs with 22% greater energy capacity and 50% longer life.  The technology has the potential to transform the global battery recycling industry, which has an expected value of \u20ac9.5 billion in 2024. 5 years post project, we expect to be operating 18 NUOVOpb facilities across the world. These will be processing 490,000 tonnes of waste LABs (6% of the global waste LAB market) and avoiding 196,000 tonnes CO2 emissions every year. In doing so, AEL will secure annual revenues of \u20ac206 million, profits of \u20ac54 million, and will have created 200 jobs within AEL.

This happens because of a a male-oriented global perception of leadership, often considering women as subordinate or even accessories to men.\r\n\r\nSo as to let women express their full potential and empower themselves to reach heading positions, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, not only by governments and national or international institutions, but also by society that still has to bust gender discrimination and stereotypes towards women, especially when it comes to work and leadership. Youth NGOs can play an important role in this, through awareness campaigns aimed at making the society recognize an equal status to women in the field of work and leadership and targeted initiatives such as workshops, trainings, support services aimed at building women self-confidence, leadership and entrepreneurial skills.  \r\n\r\nIn order to do so, youth organizations from 6 EU countries (i.e. Lithuania, United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy, Greece) working in the field of gender equality, women empowerment and inclusion have united for the project \"Wonder Women\". \r\n\r\nTHE MAIN AIM OF THE PROJECT is to create an environment for youth NGOs where they could develop various competences and tools aimed at leadership building, personal branding and entrepreneurial learning as main tools to empower women through youth work.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a broadened impact, a training course \u201cWonder Women\u201d for youth workers will be hosted in Lithuania on 24-30 October 2018, involving 30 youth workers from six European countries that face different gender issues.\r\n\r\nTo reach the key aim of the project mentioned above, the following OBJECTIVES have been set:\r\n1) Define the role of youth NGOs and youth workers and enhance their transversal skills in the field of women empowerment;\r\n2) Improve the quality of youth work by developing new tools and methods for women personal branding and leadership building;\r\n3) Share good practices of women empowerment in Europe and help youth NGOs and youth workers learn from each other;\r\n4) Raise public awareness about gender issues and women rights in Europe and promote the idea of women as strong, independent and capable member of the society.\r\n\r\nBy seeking these objectives, personal development goals will be achieved by participating youth workers, Namely: a) help the participants increase their social responsibility towards gender discrimination in leadership positions; b) involve the youth workers in discussions and decision-making in an international environment; c) keep the youth workers active and help them learn how to put ideas into actions; d) enhance their social skills and multilingualism, as well as stimulate their cultural exchange.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these goals, a range of NFE methods and activities will be carried out: 1) Interactive sessions about women empowerment and leadership; 2) Interactive workshops with guest speakers on related topics (i.e. How to empower women through social business; Stories of Success; An importance of community); 3) Organization of a public event (Wonder Women Public Conference in Kaunas municipality), and many others.\r\n\r\nThe activities will help the participants to improve a number of skills and competencies required for the creation and promotion of initiatives in support of women empowerment. This way, the participating organizations will not only benefit from the new skills and knowledge acquired by their youth workers, but will also have the chance to: 1) grow internationally 2) increase public awareness of their actions and 3) enhance their capacities of reaching the objectives of women empowerment. The organisations and participants will share the results of the project both online and offline in their respective countries (incl. \"Let's make it WOW\" Guidebook, social media campaign, videos, photos, etc.). Results\u2019 dissemination will also be facilitated through the involvement of media, public authorities and youth NGOs that will be invited to join local workshops and initiatives related to women empowerment carried out after the training course. All of this will reach a large number of people, who will become more aware of the importance of the issue.\r\n\r\nAll in all, \"Wonder Women\" project will contribute to achieving gender equality by providing skills to youth workers and their organisations to take action in empowering women leadership and increasing general awareness on gender issues in participating countries.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-2-LT02-KA105-006000_5"], ["9SW", "FEMpower!", "Hidden Voices", 23860.0, "The \u2018FemPower!\u2019 project will be a youth exchange, held in Birmingham (UK) from the 9th until the 16th July 2018. \r\n\r\nWhilst the UK feminist movement began during the 1800s through figures such as Emmeline Pankhurst, it has continued into the modern day. Recent campaigns have covered a wide range of issues that girls and women continue to face every day, including This Girl Can and #MeToo. The movement also includes issues such as the gender pay gap, which was on average 16.3% in Europe in 2015. Whilst international actors such as the European Commission and the Sustainable Development Goals have pledged to achieve gender equality, imbalances continue to persist. Our project would enable youth workers to learn about and become promoters of gender equality on local, national and international scales. It will educate young people about the benefits of equality, whilst also ensuring the inclusion of female participants from disadvantaged backgrounds during the project itself. The project\u2019s content will be primarily built upon participants discussing their experiences, allowing them to analyse the different forms of gender discrimination across Europe before undertaking their own campaigns.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n- To understand the causes of gender discrimination. This will consider the religious cultural \u2018norms\u2019 of some societies, the assumed roles of different gender based on characteristics and stereotypes, and the lack of facilitation for women in employment and education.\r\n- To learn about the different forms of gender-based discrimination. This includes the gender pay gap, the types of jobs typically taken up by women/men, gender-based violence, and the expected roles of women in society.\r\n- To discover any disparities between gender-based discrimination across Europe. This will be primarily discussion-based, and thus participants from each country will be able to contribute if they feel comfortable doing so.\r\n- To teach participants about the various feminist movements, both those which are ongoing and in the past, to help them come up with their own campaigns and ideas for future projects and cross-European collaborations.\r\n- To promote cultural awareness among the participants, encouraging an understanding of different nationalities and languages.\r\n\r\nThe project will be made up of 40 participants from the UK, Italy, Poland, Spain, Greece, Bulgaria and Lithuania; selected according to the following criteria:\r\n- Young people aged between 16 and 26. We want to include people aged under 18 to offer opportunities which may not be available to them otherwise due to age restrictions;\r\n- People of both genders who express an interest in gender discrimination, but may not know a great deal about it;\r\n- Youths of different religions and cultures;\r\n- Youths from disadvantaged backgrounds, whether it be socially or geographically. This will allow our project to expose them to educational opportunities and social networks which may not have been available otherwise;\r\n- Young people which have had no/minimal exposure to the Erasmus+ programme;\r\n- A working knowledge of English.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on non-formal education. As a new organisation, we will use our existing contacts for guest speakers/facilitators/day trips. Sessions will cover: exploration of the city, interactions with the locals, discussing the key concepts/causes/effects of gender discrimination, analysing feminist campaigns, trips to the Birmingham City Council House and Houses of Parliament, and the implementation of their own campaigns. There will be discussions around the development of partnerships through future Erasmus+ projects. The project will include the Youthpass as motivation for active involvement. As it is non-formal learning, methods will include icebreakers, energisers and name memorisation games, a treasure hunt, discussions, groupwork activities and dixit cards.\r\n\r\nWe will assess the results of our project through regular assessments conducted by participants, group leaders and Hidden Voices. The results will be disseminated to the local media/social media/websites of ours and our partner organisations\u2019. This will allow us to make improvements for future Erasmus+ projects run by Hidden Voices and our partners.\r\n\r\nOn a local level, the new knowledge/skills gained will be passed onto their family and friends. They will be provided with opportunities to become involved in the international feminist movements. This can be via joining a campaign, starting their own, or running an Erasmus+ project on gender discrimination. They will have developed the foundations for pan-European partnerships whilst promoting multiculturalism and the ideals of tolerance/acceptance among different cultures and nationalities, in addition to inspiring other young people to become involved with Erasmus+. For Hidden Voices, the project will allow us to develop our partnerships with other organisations, in addition to gaining project management experience for future Erasmus+ projects.", null, "Hidden Voices", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA105-047654_coordinator"], ["9SW", "United we stand against radicalization", "Hidden Voices", 18334.0, "The project \u201cUnited we stand against radicalization\u201d is a multilateral youth exchange that involves youth from 5 countries-United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain and Turkey.  It will include 35 participants in total aged 16 to 26 years old that will gather in Bansko, Bulgaria from 22.06 until 01.07 2018.  The methodology to be used is entirely based on non-formal education approach and will boost the exchange between participants trough various tools such as role play, thetre, simulations, team and trust building games, creative presentations and discussions, etc.  The need of the project lays on the fact that in last few years in Europe  we observe increasing number of young people being drawn into extremist movements in their search for identity and a meaningful place in society. Profound feelings of injustice and frustration about their social exclusion are amongst the main root causes contributing to young people's vulnerability, and increase their willingness to adhere to extremist, sometimes violent groups, which offer an apparent social purpose to them. Moreover, the refugee crisis from the last few years in Europe increased  the number of far-right extremists groups and nationalist parties, creating environment for instability of the European values of human rights, diversity, tolerance and solidarity. Here comes the role of non-formal education-as a tool to raise awareness, inform and encourage European values thus reducing the risk of radicalism. \r\nThe main objectives of the exchange are:\r\n- Raising awareness of the issue of extremism and radicalization of young people and the role of young people in preventing them\r\n- analyzing and realizing the key factors that can lead to the radicalization of young people such as discrimination, hate speech, xenophobia,\r\n- to help young people understand the process of forced radicalization with different roots, causes, stages and effects, thus helping to reduce the risk of radicalization at European level\r\n-understand and be aware of the role of social media as a channel for spreading the language of hate and extremist ideologies and promoting media literacy\r\n- promoting a positive attitude, acceptance and understanding of 'other and different', and in particular refugees and migrants\r\n- to help young people better understand what hate speech is and the link to extremism\r\n- raising awareness among young people about extremism as a serious problem, as well as the serious consequences of radicalization for European society\r\n- promoting the European values of democracy, respect for human rights, diversity, intercultural dialogue", null, "Hidden Voices", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA105-047780_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8PY", "AURELIUS ENVIRONMENTAL LTD", 1137504.0, "Achieving a resource-efficient and climate change resilient economy and a sustainable supply of raw materials (08.02.03.05)", "fts_2017_21432", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "B13"}
