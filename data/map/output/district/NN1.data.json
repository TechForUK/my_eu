Despite the numerous advantages of FLOSS as a cooperation model, however, most developed software faces a limited life cycle and applicability. The absence of a common platform where projects can publish their software - with reliable and trustworthy usage terms/conditions - creates adoption difficulties. As a result, software is re-invented within the ICT community, leading to duplication of effort and failed R&D opportunities.Adopting FLOSS paradigms will extend the lifetime and sustainability of ICT software, increasing contributions to and from the community. To achieve this vision it is necessary to: promote FLOSS for ICT projects, by removing existing obstacles, especially legal and business barriers; create a feedback loop for FLOSS usage in ICT projects that encompasses the EC and enables them to assess the true benefits of a FLOSS-driven model; enable long term exploitation of FLOSS through a sustainable model for ICT contributions.The PROSE proposal is a Coordination Action (CA) that targets these goals through a three-fold, complementary approach:(a) Create and manage a shared platform for FLOSS, capable of generating the required feedback loop;(b) Develop a training program that provides knowledge and learning about this shared platform, as well as legal and business aspects regarding the adoption of FLOSS;(c) Execute a dissemination program to increase awareness of the advantages of adopting a FLOSS-driven model in ICT projects.With these three coordination elements, the PROSE CA will increase the sustainability of FLOSS in ICT; thereby extending the reach of ongoing FLOSS efforts beyond their current boundaries, and thus increasing the R&D opportunities in the European space.", 36263.0, 497988.0, "PROSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_188908_955842463"], ["2BG", "Efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-2 (ld-IL-2) as a Treg enhancer for anti-neuroinflammatory therapy in newly diagnosed Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients", "Motor Neurone Disease Association", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative disorder of the brain and spinal cord affecting some 40,000 individuals in Europe, causing 11,000 deaths each year. Our pioneering work on riluzole showed that it is possible to modify ALS progression but all subsequent trials of potential neuroprotective agents have failed. Thus, drug development in ALS, including trial design, patient selection, and outcome measures must be re-engineered to break the current impasse. Nerve cell death in ALS is associated with inflammation, which contributes to cell damage, and is a logical target for therapy. Although therapeutic attempts to modify this have failed so far, the discovery of regulatory T cells (Tregs) as key players in controlling inflammatory processes opens new possibilities since defective Treg function is important in ALS. In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS.

We teach compulsory languages (French and Spanish) to age 16 and optional languages to 18 years.We are a multiracial, diverse school, which has a variety of international links.OBJECTIVESWe hope to further internationalise the school and raise awareness of languages and language teaching.  We hope to upskill teachers, in terms of pedagogy and of linguistic skill. We hope to introduce a third language (German) option at all stages of language provision in the school.NUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS7 experienced teachers who have not had this opportunity for immersive linguistic training and view of other cultural teaching approaches previously. All speak two or three languages currently and are enthusiastic linguists who will take full advantage of the opportunity. One head of department and two teachers with additional responsibilities - including teacher training and outreach (thus enhancing the reach of the project) will participate alongside four experienced classroom teachers. All teachers are European Citizens. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESTeachers will be involved in a range of workshops, sessions, observations and learning activities formulated by reputable training providers. This will include immersion and observation and discussion of pedagogy  in the country of the target language (France, Germany, Austria).METHODOLOGYFour mobility flows are planned of either one or two weeks, involving immersion in language at suitable level for participants, using recognised training centres with strong reputations. Questionnaires, discussion, appraisal and evaluative planning will be carried out after the mobilities in the project are complete. This will include consultation of staff participants and student voice.

The condition can challenge traditional parenting styles and cause parents to feel deskilled and disempowered.  The presence of autism within the family can negatively affect the educational achievement, employment opportunities and social inclusion of mothers, fathers, siblings and the individuals with autism themselves.\r\nTeaching parents to understand the condition, and to work effectively with schools and other professionals, has been shown to be effective in improving outcomes for individuals with autism and their families. However, though such parent education programmes have been developed in e.g. Western Europe and the USA, there is little or no availability of such programmes or materials in many areas within Europe, for example in the Balkan/Eastern Mediterranean region.  \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nIn order to address this inequity, a strategic partnership has been developed involving universities, non-governmental organisations and the parents of children  with autism to:\r\n-develop an evidence-based model for delivering parent education in autism that can be used across Europe\r\n- develop a core curriculum and ecologically valid parent education training materials\r\n- use these materials to provide parent education to families living with autism in areas where it has been previously unavailable\r\n- evaluate the effectiveness of the materials and the impact of the training using quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis\r\n- share the model curriculum, tools and materials with stakeholders and make recommendations to policy- and decision-makers.\r\n\r\nPARTNERS\r\nThere are nine partners in the strategic partnership.
