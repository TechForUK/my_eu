We strongly believe that as part of our school development engaging in global learning with schools and education in Europe and enhancing our curriculum will enhance pupils SMSC, curiosity, global awareness and independent learning which strengthens the schools vision, values and ethos further.\r\nTherefore, the main aims of the project are:\r\n\u2022 To improve teaching and learning through quality professional development and internationalisation \u2013 improving staff expertise (teaching and learning support staff)\r\n\u2022 To enhance the schools creative curriculum further through developing more global links, such as sustainability\r\nTo develop leadership skills and expertise of staff within a European context and learn from first hand experience in other colleagues practice in Europe  and develop sustainable partnerships\r\nTo achieve the aims staff professional development is essential to reflect on and evaluate policy, practice and methods /strategies used in European contexts to develop further high quality teaching and learning experiences which develop the whole child. The contexts chosen link directly to the three overarching goals of the school development plan and will enable more knowledge and understanding to be gained of European culture and enhance the development of a global curriculum.\r\n(these aims apply to both projects areas - Curriculum Development and Wellbeing)\r\nWe have devised a European mobility and cooperation plan which includes attendance at structured training courses of the duration between 5 and 7 days  in Finland, Spain, Italy and Sweden. These are:\r\nUnderstanding Finish Education: Finland; Ideas for developing a global curriculum: Spain ; Teaching and Learning Outdoors: Sweden ;Wellbeing  in Education: Spain and Italy. All courses fit well with our project aims and will allow us to develop teaching and learning within a European context. \r\n\r\nWe plan for 24 staff to take part ( 4 different members of staff to attend over a period of 24 months, both teaching and support staff from different age phases in the school) so that training and development can be shared more quickly and integrated into classroom practice. We plan for a wide variety of different staff will take part in the visits. Following discussion with the staff there are many staff who would like to lead and be involved in the visits. Fair access protocols would be adhered too. The participants involved will be motivated, coaches who can lead and disseminate information and share the experience. They will come from a variety of different roles in schools, i.e. leadership team, teaching and learning support staff.  There will also be direct links to leadership roles within school, such as for the Community Partnership Leader. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact is  a developed staff confidence and expertise with current knowledge and understanding of teaching methods together with an understanding of a wider range of cultures. It is expected the impact will involve developing a more global dimension to the creative curriculum and enhance teaching and learning impacting on improve outcomes for children. In turn this will impact on developing a more cultural aware community for the school (including parents) in the long term.", "http://www.brockshill.leics.sch.uk", "Brocks Hill Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046888_coordinator"], ["7LW", "Construction Hospitality And Tourism European Work Experience Project", "Leicester College", 857903.0, "This project will provide 272 Leicester college learners with the opportunity to participate in an overseas work placement that will last between 2 - 4 weeks, located in Seville, Spain. The participants will be taken from three different vocational areas:\r\n\r\n- Construction\r\n- Hospitality & Catering\r\n- Travel & Tourism \r\n\r\nThe participants will travel to Spain over two academic years, between September 2018 and June 2020. We will send 2 groups of participants in the following flows:\r\n\r\n2x 36 Hospitality & Catering participants will travel for 3 weeks\r\n2x 15 Travel & Tourism participants will travel for 2 weeks\r\n10x 20 Construction participants will travel for 4 weeks\r\n\r\nAll participants will travel with tutors from their respective vocational areas who will support them to settle in to Spain and begin their work placement.\r\n\r\nThe participants will complete a range of tasks within their work placement that are related to their vocational course of study. Leicester colleges course tutors have selected specific units of their vocational course that can be achieved within the context of the work placement. The learning outcomes for each unit will be detailed in an individual learning agreement for each participant, which will also include guidance on how learning should be recorded and evidenced whilst the learner is on placement. The ECVET framework will be used to support this process, with all roles and responsibilities for the host organisation detailed within a memorandum of understanding. The course tutor will be an accompanying person and will meet with each of the host organisations during the first week of the mobility to discuss this process and clarify roles and responsibilities. The  accompanying person will also support the participants during the last week of the mobility to assist them to gain all of the required evidence for their course, before they return to the UK.\r\n\r\nIt is very unlikely that any of our participants will have completed an overseas work placement previously, so we feel that a maximum of 4 weeks is a realistic time frame for each cohort to adjust both working and living in a new country, whilst gaining meaningful work experience in a structured environment where they will be supported by the host organisation staff throughout the mobility as well as by their accompanying person, to assist them to achieve their Learning Outcomes.\r\n\r\nAll of the participants will receive preparatory training to help them to prepare for the mobility; they will also receive an in-country orientation when they arrive in Spain, to assist them to adjust to the environment and get familiar with the local surroundings. The participants will also receive structured support from both their course tutor and line manager within the work placement.\r\n\r\nCompleting an overseas work placement will provide for participants to develop their soft skills, participants will be supported to set goals and reflect on their learning in this area and think about how they can use these skills practically, when they return to the UK.\r\n\r\nIn recent years we have received extremely positive feedback from our past participants in regards to their mobility experience. The mobility project will provide  the participants with an opportunity for personal and professional development, and we expect this to impact on our learners by increasing their job readiness and broadening their perspective and aspirations. They will gain sector specific work experience and a new perspective on labour market opportunities. We hope this will motivate, engage and inspire our learners to complete their course of study and progress to further education and/or employment. \r\n\r\nLeicester college will also use this project as a staff development opportunity for those tutors involved, and it enables us as a College to enhance our course offering, making our courses more attractive to prospective learners and widening the scope of our curriculum.

This tendency misleads citizens, distorts reality, causes prejudices and mistrust in the societies. Youth workers acting on behalf of civil society need to learn how to recognise and break down key terms and ideas for understanding fake news with media literacy principles.\r\n\r\nErasmus+ \"Look Sharp: deconstructing fake news\" project is designed for youth workers who seek to incorporate media literacy skills into their daily work. This project is for organisations working within 12 EU \u2018Programme\u2019 countries, and aims at examining the role and impact of fake news in creating prejudices and stereotypical images of vulnerable social groups, such as migrants and refugees. The project includes a preparatory stage, training course, dissemination and follow-up activities. The training course will bring together 37 participants from France, Italy, Spain, Estonia, Netherlands, Romania, Greece, Hungary, Croatia, the UK, Czech Republic and Sweden. It will be implemented in Laghet, in France between 17-26th of October 2018, by Mitra France NGO. \r\n\r\nThe media literacy and critical thinking approach in youth work is targeted through non-formal learning what is relevant to Erasmus+ Programme objectives and priorities for year 2018.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are:\r\n    \u2022 to provide youth workers with knowledge and competency in media literacy principles;\r\n    \u2022 to instill skills to use different tools for media content analysis;\r\n    \u2022 to explore the phenomenon of fake news, both in deconstructing the fake and comprehending the true;\r\n    \u2022 to develop competences how to work with youth with fewer opportunities; \r\n    \u2022 to advance non-formal education and cooperation in the field of youth work with EU Programme countries. \r\n\r\nMitra France have teamed with the trainers and several partners and have jointly developed a unique interactive methodology in media literacy. It addresses content analysis by using a non-formal logic approach. This methodology is constantly updated in order to respond to the needs of the participants, and to reflect the fast pace of the reality and complexity of European societies. \r\n\r\nActivities will include presentations, analytical workshops, simulations, hands on workshops, interactive multimedia workshops, debates, collaborative work, brainstorming, energizers, and team building exercises. Individual and group reflection sessions will be included in the program with aim to provide the participants an opportunity to reflect on their learning process. The questions and discussion will connect theories to a concrete youth work. Participants will present their organisations and share best practices and know-how, meet journalists and learn about youth programmes in Europe. \r\n\r\nThe project will also address the development of the social capital of participants and the development of media literacy competence that can easily be applied by the youth workers in their own activities. It will support personal and professional development of youth workers. Participants will engage in critically thinking about topics such as fake news, media biases, stereotypes, and prejudices. Once participants learn to decode biased or fake messages, they will be better equipped to instill fundamental common values to their target groups. \r\n\r\nThe main results of the project will be the level of competence and experiences gained by youth workers. The impact of this project on participants will be seen from the knowledge, skills and attitudes they acquire. Participants will be trained in media content analysis skills for use in youth organisations and the empowerment of young people. \r\n\r\nThe development of critical thinking is expected to bring about behavioral change that will enable to reduce prejudice and promote tolerance for diversity. It will broaden cultural awareness of trainees and improve foreign language, ICT and communication skills.\r\n\r\nParticipants of the training course will have the opportunity to travel within Europe and create a network of youth workers for learning and sharing ideas to initiate new activities. They will learn how to support participation in public life and integrate people with fewer opportunities into society by promoting non-formal education and building the capacity and quality work in youth organisations.\r\n\r\nOn the organisational level this project will foster the cooperation of NGOs in the youth field.
