The objective of the project applied for is to enable it to also teach Spanish and Spanish culture to its pupils, and the wider community, including other schools.\r\n\r\nThe participants involved will include the school staff, the Head Teacher, the pupils, parents and other cluster schools.\r\n\r\nThe activities planned to achieve this include twinning with a Spanish school, a staff member's attendance at an LFEE Spanish immersion course, sharing of knowledge gained from this course with colleagues, and formulation of a plan with the Head Teacher to enable all pupils to learn Spanish language and culture, and ultimately include this in the school's curriculum.  The long-term impact of this will be to raise the language proficiency and cultural awareness of all participants, and have a positive impact on the school's ethos in terms of its European identity, with a similar impact on the community in which it operates.", "http://www.lauder.scotborders.sch.uk/", "Lauder Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-036212_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TD2"}
