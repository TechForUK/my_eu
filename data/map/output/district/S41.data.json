Scientists significantly improved the functionalities of the promising biopolymer PHB through modifications in the fermentation process and reinforcement with bio-based nanofibres.\n\nWork on the EU-funded http://www.bugworkersproject.eu/ (BUGWORKERS) (New tailor-made PHB-based nanocomposites for high performance applications produced from environmentally friendly production routes) project led to a cost-effective and environmentally friendly bio-nanocomposite targeted for household appliances, computers and telecommunications devices.\n\nInvestigators successfully developed a route to a tailor-made PHB biopolymer structure with improved functionalities compared to commercially available PHB. These include enhanced thermal and chemical properties, better compatibility with cellulose fibres, greater ease of processing and higher resistance to impact.\n\nThe precursor sugar blends that were fed to the bacteria played a critical role. They were obtained from hydrolysed wheat straw as agricultural waste, both cost effective and non-competitive with food production. Optimising the combination of culture media and precursor feeds led to high yield of improved PHB.\n\nResearchers also developed economically feasible processes to yield cellulose nanowhiskers and lignin nanofibres with new functionalities from lignocellulosic wood waste. Enzymes are nature's catalysts and the team used green enzymatic processes to separate out the wood biomass components and produce nanofibres with antimicrobial, flame retardant and self-assembly properties.\n\nUsing standard extrusion and injection processes, the team successfully produced complex multi-layer parts using PHB and both types of fibres. The parts demonstrated significant improvements in mechanical properties. Demonstrator components for four different industrial case studies were produced.\n\nRising petroleum prices along with the need for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastic could ensure faster commercialisation of BUGWORKERS bio-nanocomposites.

For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results and our intention is to continue this work in 2016-2018 so that more students are able to participate. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.

Eurofound\u2019s report on youth entrepreneurship in Europe indicates that 48 % of European youth are interested in becoming entrepreneurs, and 41 % believe this is also possible. Still, in 2013, only 6,5 % of young Europeans were self-employed (Eurofound, 2015). This indicates that within Europe\u2019s youth there is an entrepreneurial spirit, but many young Europeans lack knowledge, skills and empowerment to pursue their ideas.\r\n\r\nInterCollege and its partners recognise that these features are vital, however, they are also intangible. The partners notice a stigma attached to failing as an entrepreneur, making youth less inclined to take the necessary risks. Also, young potential entrepreneurs often lack experience, and they can benefit from the know-how of experienced entrepreneurs. Thus, the partners strongly believe that under the right conditions, youth who are motivated to realise their innovative ideas can develop the necessary competences and be empowered to pursue self-employment.\r\n\r\nAs such, it is the responsibility of non-formal trainers to promote entrepreneurship among youth. To do that they will need a proper and informed skill-set. Therefore, the partners want to arrange a YE where youth with an entrepreneurial spirit, mentored by experienced entrepreneurs, can get a hands-on experience with entrepreneurship and a CME where the partners will help each other explore tangible ideas and create concrete projects to promote youth entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to utilise the already existing entrepreneurial spirit among youth by creating an environment where young entrepreneurs can flourish and grow.\r\n\r\nThe aim will be reached through the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Provide an expectation-free environment where young people can be supported to develop and test their entrepreneurial ideas;\r\n2. Create concrete project proposals for promoting an entrepreneurial spirit amongst youth through utilising best practices of the partners and results of the YE;\r\n3. Offer reflections upon own and partners' potential to create visibility, dissemination, exploitation and local impact of projects.\r\n\r\nThe project will consist of the following activities:\r\n\r\nActivity A1 is a YE based upon the concept of an entrepreneurship incubator, gathering 24 young people who are highly motivated about entrepreneurship and has expressed a desire to participate actively in the exchange, as well as 6 youth leaders with at least one year's experience. The activity uses different non-formal methods to develop the skills, attitudes and knowledge of young people to develop and implement own business ideas. During the YE the participants will be mentored by experts within the field of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nActivity A2 is a CME gathering 43 participants who are non-formal educators/youth leaders working at the partner organisations. Following visits to a local enterprises and non-formal sessions and discussions on the importance and relevance of non-formal education and the results from the YE, the participants will cooperate to create concrete proposals for promoting an entrepreneurial spirit among youth through international projects designed within the framework of the E+ Programme. Participants should further represent their organisations through presentations, organisational speed-dating and through own activities.\r\n\r\nThe partners expect that as a result of this project, the young people participating on the YE become motivated to take the necessary risks and become socially responsible entrepreneurs. Moreover, the youth leaders will gain tools and methods to motivate youth in their communities and promote an entrepreneurial spirit, and the participants on the CME will produce at least 6 concrete project proposals promoting entrepreneurship among youth that will be implemented by the participating organisations to the benefit of local youth.\r\n\r\nAlso, the CME will establish lasting partnerships between the participating organisations. The participants and the organisations they represent will be inspired by each other and introduced to new perspectives on entrepreneurship, youth, non-formal educationwhich will strengthen their capacity to promote youth entrepreneurship and reach out to young people in their local communities.\r\n\r\nThus, on the long term, this project will potentially benefit local societies in the 15 countries that the partners are located in, as they will gain more young entrepreneurs who, as active citizens will fight youth unemployment and foster development.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.

Additionally, the project entails motilities of students from Food and Health, Business and Customer Service, Construction and Housing as well as Service and Transport to the UK. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the project gives the schools the opportunity to boost the professional development of their staff and strengthen the cooperation with their international partners through observation stays in VET-schools and companies abroad, partners in the project. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to give the students practical and international experience while also giving the students clarification of their wishes for their future employment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the professional experience, the students will gain knowledge upon local traditions and culture and improve their language skills. To strengthen the outcome of the students\u2019 experience, the schools will provide an extensive preparation before each flow where the students will get tools to embrace other cultures and improve their English communication skills. \r\nHence, a traineeship at a VET institution or workplace abroad will enhance the KUU students\u2019 vocational competences by giving them a new perspective on their field of work and new working methods. Additionally, it will give them intercultural competences and improve their language skills. Likewise, it will have an impact on their personal development and contribute to strengthening their employability and readiness to further education. Thus, the project addresses several priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the ET2020, including the targets regarding employment and education. Similarly, the project supports the schools existing work with preparing their students for seeking employment as vocational assistants or study at another youth education programme.", "http://www.intercollege.info", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DK01-KA102-046906_2"], ["7AJ", "Capitalizing Vocation 2018", "InterCollege (UK) Ltd", 96706.0, "The project is proposed by a consortium of partners. The schools in the consortium are already working together, along with five other partners, on delivering the combined secondary education (Kombineret Ungdomsuddannelse) in Aarhus. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to offer an international dimension to the KUU programme in Aarhus.\r\n\r\nDue to various challenges, the learners on KUU, in most cases, have a steeper hill to climb than learners of other, more typical educational programmes, however, it is a priority of the consortium that once their learners complete the KUU programme, they enter the labour market or another secondary education on a 'level playing field' with others. To achieve this, it is essential to offer the students international competences.\r\n\r\nThe needs have been delineated on three levels:\r\n- Need of the consortium: Strengthened regional and national reputation of KUU and vocational education through delivering relevant and effective learning with a strong international dimension\r\n- Need of the organisations: A common organisational approach and commitment to applying a strong international dimension in VET delivery through KUU programmes\r\n- Need of the learners: Strengthened transversal skills and inter-cultural competencies to take forth into continued education or employment.\r\n\r\nThe consortium has planned a total of 120 student mobilities divided on the vocational lines as listed below:\r\n- 1 flow for the Care worker-line to YMCA, UK for 10 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Service Pilot line to InterCollege (UK) for 20 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Film and TV line to  InterCollege (UK) for 10 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Technology Communication line to InterBildung, Germany for 20 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Construction and Housing line to InterBildung, Germany for 20 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Culture Pilot line to ADEPT, Romania for 10 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Culture Entrepreneur line to ADEPT, Romania for 20 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n- 1 flow for the Activity Assistant line to ADEPT, Romania for 10 students plus accompanying staff.\r\n\r\nThe consortium applied for its first collective mobility project in 2017, and it is planning to implement that project as one large, collective flow. Although, the consortium has yet to implement its collective activities, a new member of the Aarhus KUU consortium has already joined this international consortium.

In particular, the partners see a need of engaging each individual to contribute to the development of communities, countries, and regions as well as of educational systems, able to raise awareness of young citizens upon the necessity for global understanding, respect and responsibility. More specifically, the partners see a need of Global Responsible Education (GRE), both in formal and non formal sectors and a need of making this concept attractive for educational providers.\r\n\r\nStarting from the need of making GRE attractive for educational providers, the partners foresee to develop a certification system and the \"Global Responsible\" label, awarded to those institutions (schools and youth organizations) that adopt an additional learning curriculum with learning objectives in Global Responsibility, prove motivation and have a clear strategy to promote GRE, as well as adopt specific Global Responsible routines.\r\n\r\nIn each of the partner countries will be trained coordinators of \"Global Responsible\" Label, who will be in charge with the administration and assessment of the institutions in connection with their application for certification.\r\n\r\nThroughout the project, the partners will make a research upon their national curriculum in secondary schools and identify the gaps and weak points in connection with GRE. Based on their findings, the partners will develop an additional curriculum (learning objectives) supplying the gaps identified. Furthermore, the partners will develop a methods-box covering various areas in GRE and sustaining the learning objectives established through the additional curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe methods will be tested on a total number of at least 350 pupils and young people in the partners' countries. \r\nAn international ToT in GRE will be organized with the aim of forming an European Network of 28 trainers in GRE. Following, 14 national trainings in GRE will be organized in order to give teachers and youth leaders in the partners' countries tools to do GRE with pupils and young people. A total number of at least 350 teachers and youth workers are expected to be reached through the national trainings.\r\n\r\nA total number of at least 35 institutions are expected to be certified within the project period.
