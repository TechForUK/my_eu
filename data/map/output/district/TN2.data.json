III (Qualified Abilities Linked To TOURism III) project, is the result of two successful experiences carried out within the Leonardo da Vinci Programme. It is addressed to 150 students, 6 with special needs, in initial vocational and technical training, from Hotel and Tourist Secondary Institutes of the Province of Pescara and Teramo. In these schools, the preparation aims at transferring technical and professional competences linked to the field of tourism and hospitality, with particular attention to linguistic skills. However, these competences often do not meet the requirements of the labor market as they are acquired mainly from a theoretical point of view rather than a practice one. For these reasons, a programme of professional training, allowing participants to take part in a training experience in a local and  an European context; the training experience in the local context is performed thanks to the collaboration of the sending partners. That is an opportunity that scholastic courses are not able to offer and it is a possibility of linguistic, professional and individual enrichment. The project wants to be an opportunity of integration of the scholastic preparation because the theoretical acquaintances will be supported and completed with practical ones. The training will place students in various cultural and social contexts, encouraging them to develop adaptability and flexibility. All this will contribute to satisfy professional and cultural growth of participants, guaranteeing the development of technician-vocational competences that could be used in the future in the local labor context. The field of tourism and hospitality has a considerable importance in the local economic and occupational structure. For this reason, suitable professionalities working in this field are needed. The overall objectives of the project are: 1. Improve the competences and the occupability of participants in the tourist field, joining the training \"on the field\" with the traditional one. 2. Develop synergies between the partner, improving the quality of the management. The expected results are the training, vocational and individual growth of participants and the promotion on the territory of youth mobility projects. Training will take place in European partners with a long experience in the management and  organization of training. The transnational mobility will take place in partners\u2019countries with whom there is already a cooperation during the previous experience and with experience in the management of mobility projects within the Leonardo Programme. The destination are: France, Great Britain, Germany, Ireland, Malta, Spain. These partners give us a  list of company linked with the field of tourism and hospitalities. Among these, structures aiming to the quality of welcome and the quality of structure and  showing, at the same time, sensibility for the environmental topic will be preferred. Moreover, considered the development of new technologies in the tourist sector and the structural delays of Italian tourism, companies operating in the business of travels on line will be selected. The mobility experience will last 5 weeks (1week: language course and cultural activities +  4weeks of training) in a period including summer months and the start of the school year. The flows will be constituted of groups of a maximum of 20 students, in order to  guarantee the presence of a group leader.", "http://www.royalspaenglish.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-IT01-KA102-000133_14"], ["3LD", "Praxe v zahrani\u010d\u00ed - cesta k \u00fasp\u011bchu", "Royal Spa English", 26216.0, "This mobility project aims to support the students of a vocational school in getting new and using earlier gained knowledge and abilities which they mastered during their secondary school study.

The importance of internship abroad lies in the fact that it offers to students better potential possibilities than similar internship in Czech companies as its benefit is not only in further professional progress but also in personal  development. We suppose that stay in  foreign-language environment of the companies and families will influence improving or creating such personal qualities like competitiveness, adaptability, independence, preparedness and active attitude to the further education. All these represent features which should characterize a modern citizen of the Czech Republic who has the same position and the same ability to assert himself  as his European competitors.

Students can choose between catering (front and back of the house), secretarial and administrative, commerce and transport courses.\r\nThe school is located in the North of France which is a rich cultural and historical area, frequently visited by tourists from adjacent regions for short stays. \r\nIn order to meet the expectations of this international clientele, mainly British, the demand of a qualified workforce is in constant rise in the region. Therefore, the students  who have both the professional skill and working knowledge of English are more likely to get a job in that context. \r\n\r\nOur project involves 8 students in their last year at school. Among them, three of them are training to be a chef and the other five are training to become waitresses. The participants were selected last June to participate in the European course. Although some could be considered as underachievers in general education, all of them are really eager to learn and improve since  they are actively participating in the extra hours. The biweekly two hours of English  provide them both English basics and cultural exposure, useful for their future mobilities. After graduation, some will carry on with their studies while some will join the labour force.\r\n\r\nThe grants given by the European Program Erasmus + will give students the opportunity to participate in two four-week training programs in England. The period is voluntarily long to take the most benefits from it. The experience is invaluable to the students. So as to provide them with the best work experiences, the teachers have considered the details, such as the selection of workplaces. (those have to offer new technics or a higher standard from those in Douai) and the educational progress throughout the year.  Another goal of the program is to teach them independence, so students can take initiatives themselves and be productive when they join work force.\r\n\r\nThe activities and the learning process have been running for two years:\r\n- 1st year : cultural and basic English preparation,  fund-raising and the mobility getting organized\r\n- 2nd year: professional level English preparation, the mobility, the assessments, the publications about the work experiences and the exams to get European additional qualification.\r\n\r\nTo get the students more engaged in the program, they will research about different cultural activities in Dublin. Also the students will apply for internships by contacting hotels and restaurants, while the teachers will work on the administrative aspect of the applications. (training agreements, assessments sheets). Once in Ireland, they will ensure the safety of the students and that the program is followed accordingly.\r\n\r\nBack from Ireland, the teachers will help the students to pass their exams and obtain their diploma in catering. They also expect the students to hone new language and informal skills which will help them in their future job pursuit or their enrolment in further studies. Therefore, the mobility will be beneficial to them. Moreover, this project will have a positive impact on the school by attracting local media attention which could potentially increase our future enrolment. Finally, this program will motivate the organizing teachers to continue  to strike for improvement.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the sponsorship and the personal  involvement of each partner are important in determining the success of the program.  The teachers keep motivated and make the school attractive.
