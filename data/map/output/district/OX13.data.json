Such profiles provide a more comprehensive view of cellular control mechanisms in man and animals, and raise the possibility of identifying surrogate markers of disease. Metabolomic approaches use analytical different techniques to measure populations of low-molecular-weight metabolites in biological samples. To decipher large metabolic data sets advanced statistical and bioinformatic tools are commonly employed.\nAlthough metabolomics has only recently emerged, dynamic profiles generated in Metabolic Flux Analysis (MFA) are becoming increasingly important to analyse biological networks in a quantitative manner and as part of systems biology approaches. MFA allows us to probe hypotheses by incorporating a priori biological knowledge to provide practical descriptions of observed cell behaviours, and to characterise the outcome of network perturbations. Flux analysis is of particular value for the diagnosis, differentiation and elucidation of mechanisms in cancer.

The three main elements addressed by FloodProBE are (a) the vulnerability of critical infrastructure and high-density value assets, being the main originators of direct and indirect flood damage, (b) the reliability of urban flood defences by improving understanding and assessment of failure processes that have proven to be critical in recent flood events and (c) construction technologies and concepts for flood-proofing buildings and infrastructure networks to increase the flood-resilience of the urban system as well as for retrofit and repair of flood defences in the most economic and cost beneficial manner.

However,  less  than 30% of patients can achieve target  levels of glucose control with this approach even  in a clinical trial setting  and many patients are either unable or unwilling to make  the personal commitment required. By contrast, preservation of even  small amounts of endogenous insulin production, has been shown  to improve glycaemic control, reduce hypoglycaemia, improve quality of life and reduce long-term complications. Importantly, glycemic control in the presence of endogenous beta  cell function is not demanding and hence would be effective across the full spectrum of individuals.  Antigen specific immunotherapy (ASI) is the preferred approach to beta  cell preservation since  this avoids  the risks of immunosuppression. Attempts  at ASI to date  although successful in preclinical models have  had limited efficacy in humans. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of novel approaches to deliver effective ASI.\nOur Enhanced Epidermal \u2013 Antigen Specific Immunotherapy (EE-ASI) system represents an innovative  approach to ASI created by combining  technologies brought  by our academic and 2 SME partners.

This is a gradual process and most patients have residual insulin levels at the time of diagnosis.\n\nIndividuals with residual insulin exhibit better glycaemic control and fewer long-term complications than those with no insulin. Considerable effort has been directed towards halting the immune attack against beta cells and preserving even low level insulin production.\n\nResearch is focusing on enhancing the activity of regulatory T cells. These cells recognise self-proteins and suppress any immune responses against them. Central to the success of this approach is the context in which the antigen is presented and the state of the antigen presenting cells (APCs).\n\nThe aim of the EU-funded http://www.ee-asi.eu/ (EE-ASI) (Beta cell preservation via antigen-specific immunotherapy in type 1 diabetes: enhanced epidermal antigen delivery systems) project is to investigate novel ways of delivering beta cell antigens to the immune system to produce tolerance rather than immunity.\n\nThe EE-ASI strategy combines a T cell targeting peptide with gold nanoparticle technology. This promotes a T cell tolerogenic phenotype and delivers bioactive cytokines at the same time. The idea is that this vaccine can be administered intra-dermally on a needs-basis to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nPre-clinical testing of the vaccine has validated that antigen presentation occurs through APCs and not due to protein diffusion to the draining lymph nodes. The next step in the project is to design and conduct a phase I clinical trial to test the safety of this novel immunotherapy approach for type I diabetes.\n\nEE-ASI project outcomes will provide invaluable insight into the possibility of vaccinating to stop autoimmunity and preserve pancreatic beta cells function.

This will bring a new dimension to future technology \u2013 a faster, thinner, stronger, flexible, and broadband revolution. Our program will put Europe firmly at the heart of the process, with a manifold return on the EU investment, both in terms of technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nTo realise this vision, we have brought together a larger European consortium with about 150 partners in 23 countries. The partners represent academia, research institutes and industries, which work closely together in 15 technical work packages and five supporting work packages covering the entire value chain from materials to components and systems. As time progresses, the centre of gravity of the Flagship moves towards applications, which is reflected in the increasing importance of the higher - system - levels of the value chain. In this first core project the main focus is on components and initial system level tasks. \n\nThe first core project is divided into 4 divisions, which in turn comprise 3 to 5 work packages on related topics. A fifth, external division acts as a link to the parts of the Flagship that are funded by the member states and associated countries, or by other funding sources. This creates a collaborative framework for the entire Flagship.", 85705.0, 76277340.0, "GrapheneCore1", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200853_959334463"], ["5ET", "HYDRALAB+ Adapting to climate change", "Samui Design and Management Limited", "HYDRALAB is an advanced network of environmental hydraulic institutes in Europe, which has been effective in providing access to a suite of major and unique environmental hydraulic facilities from across the whole European scientific community.\nA continuation project will prepare environmental hydraulic modelling for the upcoming urgent technical challenges associated with adaptations for climate change.

Within this project we would like to combine/unite several partners/countries. The project and the training will be part of the pupils' thesis. They will choose a subject about which they do research during their training.  If possible, the training places will be chosen according to specific features of a country (eg. moose and forestry in Sweden, ICT in big hotels in Prague, veterinaries in the UK...). Our network is varied and cross-sectoral. All our partners have expressed full engagement and willingness to participate.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the project are:\r\n-to let our pupils gain a real and stimulating on-the-job experience, to let them find out how company cultures might differ, which tools and methods are being used on the working floor in other European countries, to let them gain expertise and to help them to grow towards becoming skilled young professionals.\r\n-to increase our pupils' language and intercultural knowledge\r\n-to help our pupils become responsible European civilians, who realize what the significance of 'Europe' can be in everyone's life\r\n-to increase our pupils' tolerance, cross-cultural awareness, social skills and problem-solving capabilities\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting for pupils to make a comparison between the different countries. Depending on the topic, they can help each other to collect information (pictures, brochures, oral explanations...). Secondly, by working in a foreign country, they will learn new working methods, competences and approaches. They can apply their usual activities in a completely new situation and find out what the differences are and also the pros and cons.\r\nFinally, but even more importantly, the pupils also live in the host country for a couple of weeks. This gives them a unique insight in life in another European country. This also needs to be described in their training report/thesis.\r\nBeing submerged in a foreign country, motivates pupils to communicate in a foreign language and also to make their own decisions and take initiative. Intensive preparation for a few months prior to the training will help them to deal with this more easily. \r\n\r\nFinally we look at our pupils' future: increasing employment for our pupils and involving them more and more in the present day Europe. Besides all the experiences and valuable encounters, this training will have a 'comparative advantage' for the future of our technical and vocational pupils, both for their personal development and the chances they will get on the labour market. The expansion of the EU nowadays has triggered an expansion in the labour market. A training abroad gives our pupils an opportunity to learn about their strengths and weaknesses, and it will make an impression on their future employers. It shows that also secondary pupils are able to take risks, show entrepreneurship, have the ability to adapt and be flexible in many ways.\r\n\r\nBesides, teachers will follow a training in the companies that accept pupils as trainees.

Business and society need young people with adequatge qualifications. With the project \u201cExperience European Business\u201c we also want to further internationalise the education at our school. Beyond that, we believe that positive experiences from international exchange may counter tendencies towards sharper national differentiation.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nThe emphasis is on the development of professional competences of the trainees, which we define as language, commercial, intercultural and social competences. Interns shall be placed in interesting companies. In this way they are challenged to use and extend their knowledge and skills. Thus, their chances on the Austrian and international labour market are rising (\u201eemployability\u201c). Moreover, they shall be increasingly able to take an active part in European life and to accept the challenges of a more and more diverse society and of digitalisation in a positive way. The participating institutions (school, companies) should also share their experiences and benefit from them.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nIn the first year of the project we assume that 16 to 20 students from the third to the fifth grade will take part in this specific project. They will be active for 4 to 8 weeks, to the biggest part in UK, and also in Italy. We hope to arrange internships in other countries, too. Hosting organisations will be various businesses (accountancy, trade, services, municipality, etc.), which will offer varied professional experiences. In the second year of the project we expect about the same number of participants. We want to encourage learners from our evening school to also participate; so far we have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nLearners will be prepared in special workshops for their jobs regarding language acquisition, job relevant activities and organization management. The project team and teachers of diverse subjects will participate here. Practical and logistical preparations are done on an individual basis with each participant, also in cooperation with partners in the host country (e.g. Go English). After the internships the experiences will be passed on to a various target groups in different formats (peer-to-peer activities, reports, presentations,\u2026).\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe Absolventenvereinigung der Handelsakademien Klagenfurt (Association of graduates of the business college Klagenfurt) as the applicant body is responsible for the processing of the project and cooperates intensively with the business college (HAK) in Klagenfurt. For this reason a separate bank account was opened. An optimal coordination is guaranteed through close personal interrelations. For UK internships our partner Go English is intensively involved in finding adequate companies and suitable accommodation, and in supporting our trainees on site. Further stakeholders, such as parents, will regularly be implicated.\r\nThe application of instruments on the Europass and ECVET-basis will also assure the quality of the execution and the internships.\r\n\r\nExpected results and impact:\r\nMainly the learners will profit from the projects directly, as their professional, social, language and cultural skills will certainly be advanced. With a highly regarded internship abroad they will obviously have great advantages on the labour market that looks for motivated, open-minded and well-educated applicants.\r\nAlso the sending institutions will have the opportunity to share the experiences of the trainees. They (respectively the involved persons) will improve their competences in international project organisation. The teachers will benefit from this projects by expanding their experiences through post-proceeding activities and by passing them on to their other students.\r\nMoreover, the region will profit from higher qualified young people in economic and social respects.\r\n\r\nLong-term benefit:\r\n2018 will be the third year of our mobility project.
