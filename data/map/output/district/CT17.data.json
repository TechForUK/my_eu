Disease identification will be based in the fast (<5 minutes), ultra-sensitive (sub-pM) and label-free detection of novel highly-specific microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers, using a small volume of whole blood (<100 \u03bcL). This POC analysis device, which will have a low cost (envisaged cost < \u20ac3000), will significantly help in the implementation of mass screening programs, with the consequent impact on clinical management, reducing also costs of treatments, and increasing survival rates.\nThe ultra-high sensitivity required for the direct detection of miRNA biomarkers present in the bloodstream will be achieved by using a novel sensing amplification technique. This technique is based in the use of molecular beacon capture probes with an attached high index nanoparticle, so that the hybridization events are translated into the displacement of these nanoparticles from the sensor surface. The use of this self-amplification technique avoids the use of complex PCR-based amplification methods or labelling processes, which are difficult to implement on-chip.\nThe cost, size and weight reduction required for deploying an affordable handheld POC device will be achieved by using a novel power-based readout scheme for photonic bandgap sensing structures where the use of expensive, bulky and heavy tuneable lasers and spectrometers is avoided.\nSpecial attention will be paid within the SAPHELY project to explore the potential deployment and commercialisation of the analysis device, by means of the involvement of relevant academic and industrial partners, as well as end users.", 121986.0, 2604127.0, "SAPHELY", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_194175_940321396"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0AS", "New methods in teaching students imigrants", "Astor College for the Arts", 8475.0, "Today\u2019s global world faces all the teachers with new challenges. They have to have the needed tools and skills to teach students from all the different nationalities and to be able to manage the educational process with the many cultural differences in a classroom. The aims and objectives of this project are to meet those essential needs. Teachers from Astor College, Dover, United Kingdom will partner with schools from Bulgaria, Spain, Poland and Italy in order to practice new methods of teaching in a multicultural environment. The aim of the present project is to identify successful strategies and techniques in the teaching process of immigrant pupils of different countries. The project will allow to the exchange teachers to build up better working and teaching relationships with students from different European countries and gain cultural awareness. Teachers from Astor College will implement mobility with the idea to observe and practice in schools from Bulgaria, Spain, Poland and Italy. The teachers will be able to implement the practices in classrooms with students from non-English speaking European countries. This will benefit our school as a whole by strengthening the literacy of our students and therefore increasing the level of our results. The individual student would also benefit from the strategies learnt by helping them improve their English, which will help them assimilate better the British culture. An eTwinning project will be registered - \"Modern Methods for Teaching Immigrant Pupils'\u2019, which will share the results of the practice of the participating schools. Teachers from Astor College, Dover, United Kingdom will prepare articles at the end of the project, which will summarize the results and identify the successful methods and approaches in teaching students from different nationalities. The articles will be published on the project\u2019s website and will be distributed by the project\u2019s partners to other schools in Europe via Facebook, eTwinning and their websites.", "http://www.astorcollege.org", "Astor College for the Arts", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-024137_coordinator"], ["0AS", "Creative Teaching and Learning", "Astor College for the Arts", 90113.0, "The world needs more and more compassionate creativity to solve difficult problems confronting us. Creative people do not have answers, but they habitually question the status quo and think about alternatives and improvements. They discover and invent possible answers. They habitually ask better questions. They have optimism and can to resolve  difficult situations as refugee crisis and the danger of the terrorist attack. When combined with empathy and compassion, creativity is bound to be a force for good. Developing creative thinking in students and teachers  above participating in the project ( directly and indirectly) will be  our small  but important step to improve the society environment. This project will contribute to promoting equality, social cohesion, active citizenship, and enhancing creativity and innovation in the European education. Schools from Bulgaria, Spain, Sweden, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus, Greece and England will develop and implement creative/innovative ICT-based contents using new pedagogies designed to strengthen students  15-18 years old learning skills and teaching  creative skills. The added value of the learning and teaching activities which we intend to implement in our project time is the promotion of the creative teaching and creative learning as necessary condition to improve the educational environment at schools and to respond on the  needs of the modern society.The  project aim will  receive it's implementation  through workshops for teaching and learning creatively which will be held during the partners meeting in every participating schoolWe will make more then 27 workshops to present end learn different creative, innovative techniques and methods for teaching and learning different subjects at school- Mathematic, History, Geography, English language,Social science and humanity, Chemistry, ICT, Drama. Teachers from the partners countries will lead this workshops according to their competence and experience in the relevant aria. Participating teachers will observe and discover  different ways to be innovative and ingenious. The best teaching model is the one which  are developed  skills in the practice of the creative teaching. Participating teachers in the workshops  will share the newly learned methods with teachers and students in their own schools. This type of communication will improve the teaching environment in all participating schools. This collaborative work will result in a common book at eight languages  and online e-book available for all teachers in EU.Teachers and students will receive  knowledge and stimulation to think creatively and act creatively in the classroom. Creativity in teaching will  deliver the knowledge to the students  in more easier and  understandable level .Students will learn to think creatively when they are exhibited on creative teaching by their teachers.The project results- the printed out brochure\u201dCreative teaching and learning \u201c  based on the  project workshops will be published in eight  languages and  will be easily  transfered and exploited in other European countries.The project involves schools which will set up a parallel eTwinning project, which will be used to support the sustainability of the project. The workshops will be recorded and the video files will be uploaded into the etwinning project space.The project address the creation of new teaching methods and  use of innovative techniques  with use of ICT technology to make education attractive and engaging and bring knowledge and skills to wide audience.Students will participate  in two theatrical performances, two concerts, interdisciplinary projects, one competition \"Brain without limits\"for problem solving tasks and games, drama lessons and training, Flipped rooms .They will work in international teams and will  published nine edition of students magazine, create short movies and use different Internet and web tools.As a  results of this partnership a video guide for creation of short educational movies in 8 languages will be created  together with Video Culture Guide for advertisement of the partners regions and Video Guide 'Creative classroom and Class management\" on 8 languages to share good drama practices collected from the project workshops.Four Learning /Training events  for students and teachers will be held in Spain, Portugal, Greece, Sweden.Three transnational meetings will be held in England, Ireland and Bulgaria.", "http://www.astorcollege.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BG01-KA219-023692_5"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["9BU", "DOVER HARBOUR ROAD*", 2585667.0, "Optimising the integration and interconnection of transport modes and enhancing interoperability (06.02.01.03)", "fts_2016_11630", 2016], ["9BU", "DOVER HARBOUR ROAD*", 2050562.0, "Optimising the integration and interconnection of transport modes and enhancing interoperability (06.02.01.03)", "fts_2017_9042", 2017], ["9BU", "DOVER HARBOUR ROAD*", 1759857.0, "Removing bottlenecks, enhancing rail interoperability, bridging missing links and improving cross-border sections (06.02.01.01)", "fts_2017_16010", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "CT17"}
