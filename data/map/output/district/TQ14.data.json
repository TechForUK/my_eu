Clinical research is also growing in complexity, labour intensity and cost.  There is a growing realization that the development and integration of Electronic Health Record systems (EHRs) for medical research can enable substantial efficiency gains, make Europe more attractive for R&D investment and provide patients better access to innovative medicines and improved health outcomes.\nEHRs can now be designed to seamlessly integrate with existing research platforms and healthcare networks to create opportunities for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical and bio-pharma industries.  However, key challenges are compliance with various ethical, legal and privacy requirements (and acceptance by the general public, patients, and medical professionals), providing a platform that works across many EHR systems and is sustainable within a scalable business model.\nA 4-year project, EHR4CR will involve a team of recognised European academic and industrial partners.  The project will build a platform to enable the use of EHR for more efficient medical research and run pilots (on interoperability, security, data quality, data storage solutions, organisational issues, accreditation and certification, etc) to demonstrate the viability and scalability of an EHR4CR business model.\nThe EHR4CR project supports the IMI strategic agenda with an information gateway solution to enhance clinical research efficiency and innovation.  A key IMI aspect is the development of a knowledge management capability that can, for example, provide information management support for other research on personalized medicines, now an IMI 2010 call topic.

The schools have worked together to construct this project because the issues they are all dealing with on a day to day basis, are all connected through an overarching local, regional, national and international concern regarding social inclusion and the potential harmful impact it can have on school, local communities and national agenda. Through face to face meetings and joint cooperation the project encompasses a range of different schools in varying contexts and with a mixture of experience in international projects and leadership experiences.

In doing so answer:       - how to communicate these ideas to all school/community stake holders?       - how we enable the facilitation of students own understanding and practice?We intend to adapt a range of activities and best practice methodology to achieve these aims and objectives to supply school leaders in the project and globally with the tools and resources, confidence and drive to aid  harmonious school and local communities. These include:1. Transnational meetings, 2. Charter of European common school leadership values: 3. Fundamental Lithuanian/British values mapped across the curriculum: 4. Co-design and attend a training course to support school leaders understand and build values driven schools:5. Case studies from each school based on a relevant issue of inclusion for their school: 6. Established protocols to enable effective inter-visitations to observe action and impact in practice:7. Transnational cooperation through e'twinning and broader teacher, class, student interaction established between partner schools. 8. Promotion of student voice in all schools: 9.Share ideas of working more closely within the local community to raise the profile of inclusive practice.The impact of this project is far reaching not only for the schools involved but significantly for all schools facing issues of social inclusion and equity. The positive impact being evident with outcomes for individual students being greatly enhanced, academically, socially and emotionally, with long term impact on social cohesion, employability, stable and harmonious communities and prosperity.
