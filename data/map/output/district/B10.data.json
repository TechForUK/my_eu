Unfortunately, young people living in rural areas or small cities are harder to access opportunities to get foreign experiences than those who live in metropolitan areas. Most of the project target groups consist of such disadvantaged/fewer opportunities young people. The project aims to create an opportunity for young people with fewer opportunities to go abroad. However, the project will increase the employment participation rates by increasing the youth's self-confidence and competence. The solution of of racism and gender discrimination problem, which is at the head of the common problems of Europe, will be supported by the project again.

They will receive volunteer language training in the project. Language training is a practical speech conversation everyday. Volunteering times were arranged together with the host organizations. The host organizations will primarily see the motivation letters of the volunteers and then decide. It is your responsibility to volunteer at the criteria required by the sending organization's host organization.\r\n\r\nThe target mass of the projects is generally disadvantaged youth, and at the end of the project, these young people are planning to improve themselves and culturally develop their employability.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.holyfam.bham.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_11"], ["9RX", "Enhancing Cultural Literacy Through Innovative Practice and Skills in Europe", "Small Heath School & Sixth Form Centre", 71905.0, "The 'ECLIPSE' is project an innovative project which places the students in the center of the teaching process. As educators from 7 culturally and socio-economically different European and Asian countries, we acknowledge that knowledge is power and in order to close the knowledge gaps, we need to equip our students with the skills and various cultural experiences which in turn will  enhance their learning experiences and ensure  success in later life. The main objective of project is to contribute to strengthening the involvement of participation of schools at the international level.  Its three components include: \r\n\r\n(1) Support to the facilitation role among the schools sharing best experiences in order to enhance the opportunities for cooperation and mobility with Partner Countries, notably in the fields of education and youth development.\r\n(2) Enhancing the Educational Systems and help development of our schools. The Project aims at removing artificial boundaries between the various cultures, fostering new ideas and stimulating new forms of cooperation. \r\n(3) Implement and create innovative new approaches to encourage and promote innovation as well as contribute to enhance capacity building in our schools. The Project will be present a challenge to develop social capital among young people and their ability to participate actively in society, in line with the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty to \"encourage the participation of young people in democratic life in Europe\". \r\n\r\nThe project adopts a creative approach to the learning theories and the innovation occurs primarily in the delivery of the project\u2019s activities: \r\n1. Forming Erasmus Creative Clubs (ECC) in each partner school, Focus Groups and Debating Society workshops is the first innovative idea because on the one hand it will promote students\u2019 intercultural dialogue, and on the other hand it will also  allow them to develop their skills, become independent thinkers and leaders of learning and develop into culturally literate and global productive citizens. \r\n2. Producing a language guide another innovative aspect of The PROJECT in the way that it places students at the center of the teaching process. \r\n3. Using mobile technologies in lessons to support learning is innovative because it allows students to embrace new technologies to support their learning, both in and out of the classroom. \r\n4. A Cultural Literacy Survey is will be instrumental to the project as it will simply focus on developing students\u2019  basic literacy skills as well as develop a core knowledge sequence combined with cross-curricular rich content.  \r\n5. Creating a cultural e-book to explore public art, painting exhibitions, history icons, photography of culture and mathematical/scientific cultural exhibitions is another innovative approach which will be developed throughout the project life time and beyond to equip students with a rich cultural core knowledge. \r\n6. Creating a Project website, forum and Blog will certainly help to develop students' skills in this field which are essential in a multicultural setting.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned activities will be enriched by student mobilities exchanges and teacher job-shadowing visits to facilitate intercultural dialogue and share good practice.\r\n\r\nThe project will have a multitude of outcomes and a positive impact on stakeholders in partner schools. \r\n\r\nStudents will:\r\n-Have a greater empathy  and respect for other cultures and nationalities  and to develop a positive attitude towards working with them.\r\n-Students will become more competent,independent and group learners as they research communicate and present  to each other and with each other.\r\n-students will recognise the growing threats to the unity of the community and will work at solutions to these problems.\r\n-the manner in which we pursue this Project and the mobilities will create great opportunities for students to work and meet with each other,promoting community cohesion/European citizenship.\r\n\r\nTeachers will:\r\n-gain an appreciation fort he way that other schools tackle different issues with job-shadowing in a European school  and improve their methodical skills of teaching foreign languages,art,history.\r\n-learn and improve their skills of Intercultural Learning Education and foreign language skills .-develop a good foundation for organising Erasmus student Individual Mobility and set relationship with European schools for future projects.\r\n-widen their knowledge on cultural differences in communication styles,etc.\r\n\r\nThe participating organisat\u0131ons,target groups and other relevant stakeholders:\r\n-develop a greater understanding for students,teachers and parents of the creative opportunities available in Europe.\r\n-gain a greater empathy and respect for other cultures and nationalities and to develop a positive attitude towards working with them.", "http://www.smallheathschool.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA219-021245_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B10"}
