Some manufacturers make random checks on single components from batches of component lots. However, components especially the surface mount type are typically supplied on tape reels to assist with component feed for automatic component placement. The manufacturer cannot check all the components. Typically, a check includes visual inspection and in circuit testing. However, performing these checks is disadvantageous for two main reasons. Firstly, the tests can be time consuming and secondly it requires the component to be removed from the packaging or reel invalidating any guarantee to a claim should a counterfeit component be found. Currently, no automatic methods exist to speedily check each single component. In addition the cost of modern X-ray inspection systems prohibits their use for smaller manufacturing concerns. ChipCheck proposal is for the development of a novel X-ray inspection system for fast automated detection of counterfeit PCB components. The aim of such a development is to address the above issues. The system will be developed so that is capable of inspecting PCB components on tape reels and other component feeding mechanisms. In addition separate PCB components will also be examinable with the developed system.

The engineering components used in such processes include for example, pipes, valves, turbine casings, pump bowls, catalytic crackers/reformers etc, all of which can be made of large section thick materials to withstand the severe pressure/temperature conditions under which they operate.

The ever growing need for the society to employ more environmentally friendly transportation policies is expected to further underline the economic and societal role of rail transport in achieving sustainable mobility across Europe in the years to follow. Today, the European rail network is continuously getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds and carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. Several infrastructure related accidents in the rail industry occur due to rail failure. The continuous increase in train traffic, axle loads and operating speeds means that the catastrophic failure of a rail section may result in severe derailments, such as the one that took place in Hatfield, UK, in 2000, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the public. I-RAIL seeks to practically eliminate rail failures by successfully delivering a non-contact high-speed rail condition monitoring system based on Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer technology. The application of the high-speed system will be complemented through the implementation of novel semi-automated testing equipment based on ultrasonic phased array technology which will be deployed for the in-situ verification and evaluation of the defects detected during high-speed inspection.

From a strict techno-economic aspect, the two CSP technologies which are currently commercially viable are those based on parabolic trough and Linear Fresnel Reflector designs. Parabolic trough concentrators are the most widely deployed type of solar thermal power plant. Most of the existing parabolic trough plants operate up to 400\u00b0C, but with recent technological advances the maximum operating temperature of newly commissioned plants can reach 550\u00b0C. Solar thermal power plants still face several technical problems related to the structural integrity and inspection of critical components such as the absorber tube and piping of the coolant system. It is currently impossible to inspect the absorber tube as it is located inside a glass envelope under vacuum. Moreover a significant proportion of the coolant system is insulated to minimise heat losses and therefore it cannot be inspected unless the insulation has been removed beforehand. One of the highest priorities for the European solar thermal energy industry is the significant improvement of the structural reliability of critical components of CSP plants. This should involve a solid reduction in inspection and maintenance costs mainly associated with unpredicted failures and leaks.\nINTERSOLAR seeks to decrease by a noticeable margin the number of failures associated with the coolant system and absorber tubes of CSP plants resulting in the minimisation of corrective maintenance costs.

The industry is therefore continuously aiming for increases in integrated circuit miniaturization, processor speeds and circuit densities. The resultant increasing numbers of ever finer features on the silicon chip, and the need to electrically connect to them has stretched conventional wired or leaded electronics interconnect technology to its limits. This trend of miniaturisation with higher functionality looks set to continue, requiring fundamental advances in device electrical interconnect and mounting technology. Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) is a key technology that simultaneously addresses the requirements for high density fine feature electrical interconnect and physical attachment of silicon chip devices. BGA is a 2-D array of miniature solder alloy spheres under the silicon chip that provides both electrical connection and mechanical attachment to a mounting socket or circuit board. The small diameter of the solder alloy spheres reduces electrical resistance and capacitance and helps to preserve electrical signal integrity. BGA technology facilitates a reduction in the silicon chip package size, better heat dissipation, and greater module (circuit) densities.

They should be taught in a way which enables them to think globally and treat everyone in the same way reagardless of the cultural backgrounds. The pupils should be taught in a way they become more independent, more responsible and more tolerant. The teachers need tools in order to be efficient in their work, thus it's necessary they can follow their fellow teachers' work abroad as well as participate in courses abroad. The carefully chosen courses with suitable programmes are an asset to the participants, but in addition the networking and the personal contacts the courses offer as a side-product are of utmost importance to the teachers. They learn as they engage in shared activities and conversations with teachers from other countries. This reflective discourse  and sharing build a platform they can use in improving their teaching skills. All students learn most effectively when they have the opportunity to practise and  transfer new learning.  The same applies with teachers. In their normal teaching environments the teachers are occupied with various tasks, not having enough the time to reflect their ideas and adapt new effective pedagogy. Job shadowing offers a perfect possibility to broaden once's pedagogical skills, e.g.  what strategies to leave out and what new ones to take in use.

They will work together to find out about:  the school system of their mobility country.  They will shadow an equivalent leader and investigate:  the structure, roles and styles of leadership in the school, approaches to pedagogy and how these are managed in their subject / phase, strengths and interesting / innovative approaches in leadership and provision.  Pairs will peer review and evaluate their learning and come to shared agreements.  They will immerse themselves in the language and culture of the partner country.  They will prepare feedback for staff, pupils, parents, governors, liaison schools and the local community.  They will plan one or more objectives, linked to their mobility, into their subject/phase planning.\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: The project will be a key objective in the school development plan and in subject and phase leader development plans.  Teachers involved will have an appraisal objective linked to their visit evaluation, their feedback to staff, their input into the curriculum, their key issues for action and the impact of their visit on future leadership and provision.  The impact of their learning will be evaluated against the teachers\u2019 standards at the end of the appraisal cycle and will link to future objectives. Outcomes will be evaluated in the school evaluation form and the headteacher's report to governors and will inform future planning.
