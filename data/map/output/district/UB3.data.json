The EU only produces 4.1 % of the total world ethanol, the US has become in recent years the biggest ethanol producer in the world with 48% of the world total and more than two fifths of the global fuel ethanol supply was produced in Brazil in 2006. The major different types of biofuels are between first and second generation biofuels. First generation biofuels are made from food crop feed stocks while second generation biofuels are made from cellulosic biomass. The primary pathway for producing bioethanol fuels from lignocellulosci biomass is biochemical conversion (acid hydrolysis which is an expensive procedure and produce low yields 10 to 40% and enzymatic hydrolysis but unfortunately cellulose is difficult to digest, produce low yields &lt;20% and take 2 days, in addition although research is continuously improving this process, at present biochemical conversion is not been proven at industrial scale). The project concept involves development of a multipurpose prototype for the reaction of various types of cellulosic biomass on a continuous or batched basis using microwave plasma or combined microwave plasma and chemical/enzyme hydrolysis. This technology will breakdown the cellulose molecule structures and allow an efficient (90% yield efficiency) and rapid release of the sugars for the fermentation reaction (&lt;1/2 day). In addition, by using microwave plasma we will use 10 times less energy, chemicals, infrastructure accessories and solvents making the conversion of cellulosic biomass into bio-ethanol an economical procedure.", 258895.0, 1192770.0, "MICROGRASS", null, null, null, "http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/BLT/BEST/RFM/micrograss/index.htm", "http://www.tmd.co.uk", null, "fp7_107794_967062356"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1DD", "C\u00c1DIZ J\u00d3VENES EUROPEOS II", "The British International School", 200717.0, "The \u201cC\u00c1DIZ  European Youths\u201d Project is fixed in a city particularly affected by unemployment  and lack of opportunities, which concerns the way the youths face their immediate environment and therefore negative personal growth and professional  development.
