This LLP provides our interns with financial support to help lower the overall costfor their families.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are that the students can acquire the skills and abilities expected by the economy. In dealing with him/herself: self-esteem, self-confidence, a sense of basic trust, appreciation, self-efficacy, introspection, self-responsibility, and self-discipline. In dealing with others: attention, appreciation, empathy, ability to comprise, insight into human nature, ability to take criticism, awareness, tolerance, respect, language competence (especially in the foreign language), and intercultural competence. In regards to teamwork: ability to work in a team, cooperation, motivation, ability to confront conflicts, communication skills, and also general skills and abilities such as responsibility, diligence, flexibility and commitment.\r\n\r\nThis year we will be dispatching 32 students to partner companies in England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany.  Students will not only get their first professional experiences in an international environment, but also be able to apply their specialized practical knowledge along with their specialized theoretical knowledge.  Third year students know that they will not only be learning how businesses operate in other countries.  As interns, they must also learn other aspects of the work environment including managing to communicate with coworkers and superiors in a foreign language as well as taking care of guests in a multilingual environment.  The practical, linguistic, and social skills acquired by our students are very important for school but more so for their future professional careers.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the preparedness and quality of the internship, there is a monitoring system during the entire preparatory phase and also during the time abroad through E-mail and/or telephone.  The supervisors are also very important during the internship.  Through personal contact with the tutors and guest organisations, we can improve the quality of the job positions provided to our students.  At our school, we support our interns through monthly meetings.  The team of teachers in charge also meet with students in their free time.  During the holidays, teachers stay in touch with our interns and are accessible through E-mail and cellphones.

Additionally, we hope our students gain flexibility, independence, and other advantages to separate them from their competition in the job market.
