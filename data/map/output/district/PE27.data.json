As we offer LDV stays for students, teachers and staff, it is a good opportunity to anchor internationalisation in the different departments of the school, along with the other international activities which make globalization sustainable and meaningful to both students and staff at the institution.\r\n\r\nThe past years the school has sent our Upper secondary and Vocational education students abroad in work placements after graduation. We consider LDV stay as a good tool to enhance the participants cultural, linguistic and personal skills in relation to succeed as Work placement Abroad student later, likewise a LDV stay in general can help to highlight career paths in the participants' subsequent education. The vocational training and upper secondary students are offered a three week LDV stay in either Spain, Germany, the UK or Malta. The participants are offered internships within the field of retail and office work. Furthermore, all the partners in our application offer cultural activities as one of our main goals is to strengthen intercultural competences. Moreover, we want to strengthen the language output of our school\u2019s primary languages, English, German and Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe Participants represent two different departments at the school and students have different academic and personal needs. Therefore we have two different procedures. The most immediate difference of the two groups is that the vocational students only are offered Malta as a destination and an accompanying teacher always will travel with the students the first week of their stay. For the vocational training students, the goal is especially to give them more confidence regarding their second language training and on the personal level. An accompanying teacher will give the students the safety they need to make such a stay a success.\r\n\r\nFor both types of students the project's overall objective is that the students throughout their LDV-stay have a good experience abroad and gain great confidence in their professional and personal qualifications. A goal in itself is that after graduation a LDV stay can motivate the students to go abroad in work placement, which many  of the returned LDV students have already expressed in their internal evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe two coordinators are responsible for the project and have selected partnerships in the UK, Germany, Spain and Malta. The partnerships are chosen because they offer a wide range of companies for internships that can meet the needs of both types of students at KHS, and because they offer language school courses. The coordinators continually are in dialogue with partnerships in relation to monitoring and improving LDV stays.\r\n\r\nThe coordinators are also responsible for selection of participants, monitoring and evaluation of the LDV stays. Moreover, the coordinators also organize the cultural and linguistic preparation courses to make the students ready for the three-week stay. The coordinators have developed a process that ensures that all stages before, during and after LDV stays are implemented and evaluated in order to continuously develop the students LDV stay. The coordinators work with the school\u2019s marketing department to disseminate the results and experiences of the LDV participants both internally and in the surrounding media.\r\n\r\nAnother target group in this application is VETPRO participants. We have good experience with sending the professional staff on a 1 week VETPRO stay focused on inspiration and training. The coordinators bring together interested candidates twice a year for an information meeting together with the Vetpro participants who have already returned home. The goal is to create a platform for inspiration and knowledge sharing of VETPRO experiences. \r\n\r\nWe apply in this application for LDV stays for 90 Vet students and 2 accompanying teachers for the period 2014-2016. We have prior to this application sent 100 Vet students and 10 Vetpro professionals abroad. Therefore, we believe we can guarantee good student stays and competent partnerships abroad and hereby realizing the objectives of this application. \r\n\r\nLDV stays are an improvement of K\u00f8ge Business College's international profile and enhance internationalisation to be anchored in the school\u00b4s strategy for the benefit of the individual student and the school as an institution.", "http://www.acer.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA102-000080_1"], [2017, "Mobility for apprentices in the region of Agder", "Association of Colleges in the Eastern Region", 114478.0, 5, 10, "Increasing the attractiveness, quality and of implementation of vocational education and training is the main challenge of Aust-Agder County. \r\n\r\nThe internationalisation of vocational education and training is one of many means to motivate more students to choose and finish a vocational career. The opportunity to go abroad contributes to a more varied and wide \u2013ranged number of studies. It will make the studies more attractive to apprentices, young people, teachers and instructors considering a vocational career. Apprentices, teachers and instructors who have contributed to the international mobility programme share their knowledge after having returned home. This inspires those who haven`t participated.\r\n\r\nOur focus is on subject areas where international experience undoubtedly may add an additional dimension to the educational pathway. \r\nFollowing and adjusting to new trends is a vital part of the curriculum of The Programme for Restaurant and Food Processing and the Programme for Hairdressing. Trends tend to arise in southern Europe and in the USA. Going abroad makes it possible to discover new trends before they reach Norway in addition to learning new techniques and working methods. \r\n\r\nOur aim is to reach a number of 100 learning mobilities for apprentices/training candidates within the Programmes for Restaurant and Food Processing, Hairdressing, Service and Transport, Electricity and Electronics and Building and Construction. One-month apprenticeship with one partner organisation is our main goal. Instructors and teachers will complete one week of job shadowing. We have partner organisations in five European countries. \r\n\r\nOur goal is that this project will contribute to increasing the graduation rate up to 75 % in 2020. We want to increase the number of applicants to the vocational subjects in general and to the Programmes of Restaurant and Food Processing and Data Electronics in particular. In addition, we want to strengthen the competitiveness of the industries in question through increased international competence. By completing the mobility programme the apprentice will gain increased professional competence, self-confidence, renewed faith in the subject area and in the industry`s ability and willingness to change. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the direct mobilisation, there is the opportunity to form strategic partnership with foreign educational institutions. We learn a lot from dialogues and co-operation with our partners. Such co-operation will, in the long run, generate various forms of co-operation between subject areas.", "http://www.acer.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-NO01-KA102-033985_6"], [2014, "ACER VETPRO4", "Association of Colleges in the Eastern Region", 62975.0, 8, 17, "ACER VETPRO4 will continue a series of mobility project which enable colleges from the East of England to build links with European partners to enhance professional development and share expertise.  This project builds upon previous  projects which comprised 11 visits by 60 VET Lecturers to Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden, Lithuania, Cyprus, Portugal and Finland. The lecturers and managers representing 11 ACER colleges were drawn from specialisms including Construction, Motor Vehicle, Electronics, Agriculture, ICT, and Business Studies, Health and Social Care, Hospitality and Catering, Travel and Tourism and Leisure and Sport. The participants also explored to what extent the host country has matched its National Qualification Framework against the EQF and implemented the ECVET system. Resulting from these visits, networks, partnerships and two-way exchanges of staff and learners have already been established. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis mobilities project will contribute to both individual continuous professional development (CPD) plans as well as continuing to develop long term strategic partnerships between Est of England Colleges and EU VET providers. Individuals will have the opportunity to widen their knowledge and expertise, including experience of different teaching and learning methodologies, innovations in technology and learning and diverse cultures to help to adapt training courses to meet employers changing skills needs.  All participants will engage in learning the basic language of the host country. Participants are concentrating on the organisation of and preparation for Apprenticeships and Entrepreneurship and Learner guidance and support during the visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will specifically focus on arranging mobilities for 60  East of England college staff- providing them with the opportunity to explore the organisation and management of:\r\n\r\napprenticeship schemes, \r\n\r\ninnovative mathematics teaching, \r\n\r\nuse of skills competitions\r\n\r\nworking with young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the host countries.

In Norway we need about 1000 more qualified employees within food and catering the next years. This is much more than what we educate today. Within the hairdressers we need more qualified personell than what we educate today. Within building and construction we also need more qualified personell. We  need to teach our apprentices how to build passive- or pluss houses. In 2015 all new houses in Norway shall have passive house standard. We need to learn from other countries in order to achieve these goals. The dropout rate is also very high in these three education programmes.\r\n\r\nThe selected educational programmes are chosen based on the needs of the companies for more and well-qualified personell. The project will systematically use international co-operation to improve the quality of education in key areas, contribute to increased recruitment to areas that need it, reduce dropout, increase motivation for learning and improvement of training in foreign languages.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT: \r\nStrengthen the participation in EU programmes and international cooperation networks , by sending apprentices and trainers/teachers within building and construction. Such initiatives could mean that the region is provided with useful experience, competence and technological solutions for mitigating and adapting to climate changes from foreign actors.\r\nIncreased recruitment\r\n- Increased status of vocational education\r\n- Increased knowledge for participants\r\n- Reduced dropout\r\n- Increased motivation\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM BENEFITS:\r\nThe MARA project aims to support the five main areas of the Regional strategy for Agder. The MARA project will be in line with the International and regional strategy for the region of Agder. The region actively uses internationally available knowledge to stimulate regional development, the raising of competence levels and lifelong learning. \r\n-in 2020 to make Aust-Agder  county a more attractive, sustainable, innovative, competitive, open, inclusive and learning region. \r\n-in 2020, apprentices and professionals in vocational training will have received education and experiences which strengthen global solidarity.\r\n-in 2020, education and research in Agder play an important role in ensuring that society is equipped to meet the global challenges of the future. \r\n-in 2020, the international competence held by the region has been significantly raised through active participation in international research and innovation programmes. \r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS AND DESCRIPRION OF ACTIVITIES:\r\nWe are planning to send 52 apprentices, 5 teachers and 5 instructors/professionals. All participants will be last year apprentices and professionals working with apprentices, such as training managers or instructors in companies and training offices.  The teachers will be working with vocational education. The instructors and the teachers will be deployed simultaneously in businesses in the partner countries. \r\nThe mobilities will take place in the region of Hengelo in The Netherlands and in the Eastern Region of England, Italy, Spain and Dennmark. The mobilities will take place between October 2015 until April 2017\r\n\r\nThe MARA project will be managed by the VET section in Aust-Agder county, in co-operation with the apprenticeship training office for building and construction (OKAB) , the apprenticeship training office for restaurant and food processing in Agder and the apprenticeship training office for hairdressers. The project team will be responsible for information, invitation, selection, monitoring before, during and after deployment, and the final reporting for all participants. Letters of intent have been made with all involved parties in the project.\r\n\r\nRESULTS AND IMPACTS:\r\nThe expected result is that the participants will gain insight into how the challenges are resolved in the recipient countries and bring solutions to improve practices at home. \"Hospitality and Catering\" and \"Building and Construction\" are pilot projects, and the county and other training offices want to extend the scheme to other subjects if this is a success. The project will contribute to positive attention to vocational training and education in our part of the country. We expect that the MARA project contributes to society and business in Aust-Agder county, and the county will be better equipped to meet future global challenges. The Region will use active knowledge available internationally to stimulate regional development, lifelong learning and development of skills.
