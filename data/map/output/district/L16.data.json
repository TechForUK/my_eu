To fill this gap, ICT use could help make art more widely accessible, more inclusive, and generate significant awareness around it. The project will involve creators who currently use ICT tools in their everyday creative practices, and engage them in a collective dialogue with ICT researchers and developers, with a focus of empowering creators by giving them access to new forms of facilitation, enhancement, and contextualization of the creative process and its product--the artistic inspiration, pursuit, and possibilities, as well as the artwork itself. The focus will be the future ICT R&D agenda, which will develop new tools for supporting the creative processes as well as enhancing and improving existing tools and platforms to be more adapted to, or to better care for, the needs of specific creators' groups. Thus, the project will also contribute to overcoming the existing fragmentation in efforts by bringing together the relevant stakeholder communities, and to the creation of a critical mass of ICT and creative communities working together. The main target users will be individual creators/workers and professionals, as well as SMEs, creative groups, communities, and organizations. Main results will include recommendations for policy, planning, and decision making for the creative industries community and convergent plans (roadmaps) for specific future actions and initiatives developments for each creative sector.", 21388.0, 775355.0, "CRe-AM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111194_983198209"], ["9JD", "Rebuilding an Inclusive, Value-based Europe of Solidarity and Trust through Social Investments", "Liverpool Hope University", "In 2013, as a response to rising inequalities, poverty and distrust in the EU, the Commission launched a major endeavour to rebalance economic and social policies with the Social Investment Package (SIP). RE-InVEST aims to strengthen the philosophical, institutional and empirical underpinnings of the SIP, based on social investment in human rights and capabilities. Our consortium is embedded in the \u2018Alliances to Fight Poverty\u2019. We will actively involve European citizens severely affected by the crisis in the co-construction of a more powerful and effective social investment agenda with policy recommendations. This translates into the following specific objectives:\n1. Development of innovative methodological tools for participative research, involving mixed teams of researchers, NGO workers and people from vulnerable groups in the co-construction of knowledge on social policy issues;\n2. Diagnosis of the social damage of the crisis in terms of (erosion of) human rights, social (dis)investment, loss of (collective) capabilities;\n3. Analysis of the relationships between the rise of poverty and social exclusion, the decline of social cohesion and trust, and the threats to democracy and solidarity in the EU;\n4. Development of a theoretical model of social investment, with a focus on the promotion of human rights and capabilities;\n5. Application of this model to active labour market policies and social protection: evaluation of policy innovations through qualitative and quantitative analyses;\n6.

Application to medical devices.", "Nanomedpharma Ltd", "Microalgae are a source of secondary metabolites useful as new bioactive compounds. Activity of these compounds against bacterial pathogens and biofilm formation has not been determined yet. Biofilm formation is especially important in infections and tissue inflammation related to implants and catheters. These problems finally cause a release of the implant, which must be removed and replaced by a new one, entailing an increase in antibiotic consumption, together with a health costs of about 50,000-90,000 \u20ac per infection episode. \nTaking both problems in account, the search of new antimicrobial agents that will be effective against the bacteria in their two ways of life, planktonic and biofilm stage, is a priority need in the clinical practice.\nFor this reason, the overall objective of NOMORFILM project is to search for antibiofilm compounds isolated from microalgae that will be useful in the treatment of this kind of infections and could be incorporated in the manufacturing of medical prosthetic devices. For this purpose, 4,000 microalgae species will be deeply screened specifically for new antibacterial and antibiofilm molecules. Structural elucidation of bioactive compounds from these extracts will assure that only new chemical entities, therefore with anticipated new mechanisms of action, will arise to further project stages, those including toxicity tests and animal models. \nThis project also addresses the biosynthesis of the targeted bioactive compounds in sustainable microalgae co-cultures, diminishing cultivation costs by mimicking natural aquatic ecosystems.\nMost industrially interesting antibiofilm molecules will be incorporated into nanoparticles in order to develop manufacturing methodologies able to incorporate these compounds into real prosthetic devices matrixes.
