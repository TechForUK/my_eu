By far the most promising replacement fuel for road transport is hydrogen because of its abundance, efficiency, low footprint for carbon and the absence of other harmful emissions. In 2015 it is expected that the number of hydrogen fuel installations will exceed a hundred thousand units.\n\nBecause hydrogen can react explosively with air there is inevitably public apprehension about using hydrogen as a mass market fuel that can inhibit wider commercialisation. Technical issues regarding hydrogen storage leakage are (i) the small size of the H molecule which causes it to diffuse through relatively open structured materials such as composites, and (ii) the phenomenon of Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE) which seriously reduces the strength of metals in extended contact with hydrogen. In order to greatly improve public confidence in the safety of hydrogen fuel, to address the technical issues, and thus facilitate the rapid commercialisation of hydrogen powered road transport, this project will develop a technology that will detect leaks and structural weakening of containment vessels caused by HE. This will prevent catastrophic failure of vessels which can actually occur before even small leaks arise. Particularly, the project goal is to develop novel tangential neutron radiography and acoustic emission (AE) techniques in combination for the reliable and cost effective continuous monitoring of the integrity of hydrogen storage tanks at central depots, service stations and on vehicles i.e. at every point of hydrogen storage along the supply chain from the production plant to the fuel tank on a hydrogen powered vehicle.

The most economical way of limiting VOC emission is using water-based coating formulas in which water replaces a substantial amount of the organic solvents traditionally used. Unfortunately, water-based formulas have deficient properties in comparison to solvent-based, primarily as a consequence of using water as a solvent: poor wood wetting, high grain raising, longer drying times, foam formation, insufficient glossy aspect, and deficient overall resistance. Coatings (varnishes and paints) are of key importance to the final products of our industries: coatings define the visual aspect and softness of the furniture piece, influencing its effective purchase; also the durability and resistance of a coating is a measure of the quality of the whole piece.

Aith is a well-maintained school,  consisting of Primary, Nursery, and Secondary departments. The secondary roll includes pupils from 4 cluster primary schools whom we work with closely. Aith is an inclusive school and pupils with special needs are catered for in mainstream classes. The modern language taught in upper primary and secondary is French. We have a vibrant team of teachers and we work closely to provide our pupils with an excellent learning environment. Shetland is geographically isolated from Scotland and therefore the staff have less opportunities to attend events and network with other organisations. Although we are a remote community, we recognise that we need to look outwards to experience and learn from other countries with the focus being on continually improving our achievement and attainment. Shetland is currently going through a structural review of its education and our school is involved in leading the attainment strategy at local authority level in both primary and secondary education.\r\nOur aim is to plan a holistic programme from Early years onwards. We are looking to developing innovative approaches to learning and teaching through international links and to kick-start relationships with schools to develop international education and develop global citizenship within our school. This project will help with the delivery of the 1+2 initiative by developing an 'all-through school' language programme.\r\nThis project would also give us the ideal opportunity to look internationally at a leading world-wide education system. Through making links and connections in an international setting we would hope to share ideas and good practice and integrate new approaches. We would like to develop knowledge and understanding of other education systems and implement changes in our own school in the context of our authority\u2019s structural review.\r\nThe staff selected to participate in the project are well motivated and placed to lead changes which we have identified as being strategic across both the primary and secondary phase. \r\nThe following teachers will take part: \r\n\u2022 Early years teacher who will be delivering French as an L2 next session;\r\n\u2022 Upper primary teacher who is our school language ambassador for primary and well placed for leading staff training within our school ;\r\n\u2022 Secondary teacher, the language coordinator of 1+2 in Shetland and will be involved in the training of primary teachers in the authority;\r\n\u2022 Primary principal teacher: responsible for running the primary department and is a member of the authority\u2019s school strategy working group; \r\n\u2022 Secondary head teacher: responsible for running the secondary department and the overall management of the entire school. Is also a member of the authority school strategy working group and will be able to oversee the implementation of change across the whole school.\r\nThe training courses we hope to attend are:\r\nJuly 2015 - Teaching and learning of French language course and culture (early years and primary) \r\nSeptember 2015  - Leadership in secondary education \r\nOctober 2015 - Teaching and learning of French language course and culture (secondary)\r\nApril 2016 - Leadership in primary education \r\nAll courses aims and objectives include: cultural sessions and visits, a visit to an institution for observation of practice and an opportunity to make links for future partnership work, evaluation and reflection of practice and language and methodology classes. We will learn about the approaches and strategies used in leading a successful school, to evaluate teaching methods, commonalities and differences in educational systems which will link to our school development plan.\r\nWe hope to make connections with schools abroad and embed these within our practice, thus providing a European context and add value to teaching and learning.\r\nThe courses will build our confidence and develop knowledge of current and up to date language, provide experience of different cultures and inspire creative teaching approaches including the use of ICT to motivate primary and secondary learners. Learners will benefit from new resources, skills and knowledge acquired by staff and the varied pedagogical approaches which will enhance attainment and may have an impact on motivation and behaviour of the pupils.

This course will help the teachers embed languages as part of everyday school routine and open up opportunities for promotion of global citizenship which is a key part of our curriculum.

IES El Yelmo, the coordinator organization, knows well the importance of maintaining a healthy environment since it is in the middle of a Natural Park, \u201cSierra de Segura\u201d. We are surrounded by specific and diverse fauna and flora and endemic species that we must care in order to assure our own health. This health comes not only from our Natural Park but from the good care of the Environment all over the world. We started working on this aim in 2000 and many of our traditions and culture have to do with the care of our surrounding. We want to share all this with other two schools which also want to transmit us all their traditions and cultural heritage as well as their concern and enthusiasm for the environment preservation. We wish to learn from the  multiculturalism and the Natural Park of  Entre-Deux and/or the fauna, flora and traditions from Yell. All this will be shared as well as the interesting ways the three members fulfill or must fulfill to maintain healthy our environment. In order to do so, our students will develop and improve their communicative skills of the foreign languages they are studying.\r\nMost of the subjects will be involved to do the activities and achieve our objectives. Many activities will be done in different subjects with the same goal. Then, they will begin by establishing  a code of conduct to be carried out at school in terms of recycling, saving energy and water, noise pollution, reusing materials, etc. This code will be also carried out at home and at the town, and broadcast on the local radio as to know at last its impact that we will request to the families, citizens and local government by means of analysis of data and questionnaires.\r\nOur students will transmit their traditions recording tutorial videos like reusing fried oil to make soap or explaining the rules of traditional sports practiced in the natural setting as \u201cBolos Serranos\u201d. These ones and others the other members will do will be at the disposal of everyone on the web.\r\nOur students will also have fun together with their parents who will participate in a contest of traditional food made with products of the area (olive oil (Spain), fruits and vegetables (UK) or cane sugar (France) at school.\r\nTraditional local legends will be read in order to write a story based on some traditional elements from the legends and transmit a message related to the preservation and conservation of the Environment. This will be done as a comic using a comprehensible foreign language since it will be addressed to Primary School students to celebrate the World Environment Day. This will develop our students reading and writing skills in an enjoyable way and will be at the disposal of the Education community to be used as a teaching material.\r\nThe three face to face meetings they will have in each country will provide them cultural and environmental information to create a final brochure. This meetings will also lead to make new friendships and speaking foreign real situations for the students and the teachers who will continue working together in the future.\r\n Then we are sure that this amazing experience will change our students and families minds. They will meet people from other countries with similar or different cultures that they will share and respect and they will work for a healthy environment.\r\n \u201cOur treasure\u201d will also serve as starting point for other school projects that might arise later on and that we will support and help.", "http://www.midyell.shetland.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA201-004791_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ZE2"}
