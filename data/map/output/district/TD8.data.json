The subjects History, Geography, Citizenship and Economics are taught in the lower and upper secondary levels (grades 7 to 12), Drama (taught in English) as a chosen compulsory subject can be picked up in the years 8, 9 and 11. \r\n\r\nThe next objective is to enable our students to obtain the Certilingua award,  the European excellence label of plurilingual, European and international competences. To provide this opportunity, to improve the CLIL education and to coordinate the two secondary levels , the seven teachers in the CLIL sector need training in the following: general language skills, language for special purposes, curriculum and lesson planning, methodical/didactic competence, ideas for resources and international project work, drama in education across the curriculum, and classroom management.  To improve the teachers' personal and professional competences and to enable further school and curriculum development, it is vital, that the CLIL-teachers get in touch with other teachers from Europe to exchange ideas, to find future project partners (e.g. e-twinning, Erasmus+ KA2, exchange) and to get insight into the European world of work. \r\n\r\nDrama taught in English is not a regular subject in Germany, high-quality teacher training courses in this field are rarely available. That's why the Drama teacher relies on the expert knowledge of British colleagues which can be understood and studied best through job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nBy participating in Erasmus+, we expect a competent staff to optimize the CLIL education at our school, to qualify for Certilingua and thereby to give our students access to a broad range of future job chances here and abroad. \r\n\r\nThis will also strengthen the values and standards of our UNESCO school.", "http://www.jedburghgs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE03-KA101-000680_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TD8"}
