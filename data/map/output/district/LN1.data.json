So far partners have compared different methods for bone marrow processing to deliver the desired mononuclear cell fraction. The optimal method for BM-MNC preparation has been further standardised so that it could be delivered in hospitals across the EU.\n\nIn addition, scientists have selected the best route for BM-MNC delivery. In the context of AMI, intracoronary infusion is usually employed to administer the cells since it is supported by evidence and safety data.

Affected neonates suffer intracranial haemorrhage, chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, with heart disease and diabetes as adults; mortality is high. Recent improvements in the care of premature growth restricted neonates, means that more of them survive delivery, but at great cost. Small increases in fetal growth and gestation at birth are associated with major improvements in survival and morbidity.\nImproving uterine blood flow is key and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important to achieve this. In preclinical animal models we showed that local VEGF gene transfer to the uteroplacental circulation using adenovirus vectors increases uterine blood flow, attenuates constriction of uterine arteries and increases angiogenesis; these changes result in improved growth of severely growth restricted fetuses.

VEGF is a protein secreted by the placenta and women with FGR could benefit if the local VEGF levels in the blood supply to the womb are enhanced via techniques such as gene therapy.\n\nRecently, use of growth factor therapy in animals dramatically enhanced fetal growth through dilating the vessels supplying the womb and by providing new blood vessel formation that increased blood flow to the womb.

Adequate joint function and longevity are the most important factors that define success, yet at least 10% of reconstructions fail within 10 years of surgery, and a large fraction of native joints progresses to early OA.

Joint failure is a consequence of inadequate competence of the patient's musculoskeletal system, joint overload and instability, or their combination. Currently, surgeons rely on 2D static radiographs and their experience to plan the procedure. To prevent failures and improve outcome, key facts on the mechanical conditions of the joint need to be available to the surgeon. By implementing refined image reconstruction, biomechanical modelling and analysis tools, MXL will make the dynamic joint loading and stability accessible for the planning of joint surgery in every case.

We receive regular requests for MSC transplantation from patients and their physicians; patient organisations support our approach.\nThe principal objective of the BOOSTB4 project is to conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of pre- and/or postnatal MSC transplantation in the severest forms of OI (type III, severe type IV). Transplantation before birth at the onset of disease should lead to greater efficacy and engraftment with less rejection than transplantation after birth.
