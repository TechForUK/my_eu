These courses typically do not have a direct route to the job market, reflected in higher unemployment and lower salaries. There can be a lack of knowledge from academics about aligning subject expertise with wider industry need as well as a lack of recognition by businesses of the wider benefits and skill sets of A&H graduates.Dedicated support in HEIs for entrepreneurial activity has been mainly focused on business, economics and ICT faculties (UBI). A&H Students come from a very different starting point, with education and skills that do not meet industry need in an obvious way. Therefore, a fresh approach is needed to develop a tailored A&H entrepreneurship model that improves the long-term entrepreneurial prospects for A&H students.The AHEH alliance will:- Bring together 14 partners from across 7 EU member states to improve the entrepreneurial capacity of A&H students. - Jointly research, design, test and disseminate an innovative programme of entrepreneurial training for A&H staff/ students aligned with the EntreComp Competence Framework. This builds upon partners\u2019 prior experience of EU-funded enterprise projects.- Have HEIs, businesses and stakeholders working together to champion the value of A&H students to a wider audience and ensure that industry need is reflected in the training programmes. - Create 7 new A&H Entrepreneurship Hubs situated in partner faculties.

Staggeringly in 2013-14 just five English players took part in all 38 Premier League matches. Currently, 93% of players at English academies are British but less than 25% of new players signed by Premier League clubs in 2013-14 were UK nationals. Clearly, our academy players are not making the transition to first team status as efficiently as our European competitors, which supports the Welsh FA\u2019s desire to study European coaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe Welsh FA\u2019s previous participation in the Leonardo da Vinci mobility programme has demonstrated the undoubted potential for mobility to enhance the employment prospects for young apprentices (VET learners). Between 15-20% of all mobility participants went on to achieve first team status, which is an unprecedented success rate and directly attributable to the benefits of mobility. By contrast, in the absence of mobility, only 5-8% of apprentices can expect to achieve first team promotion.  One of the great value-added benefits of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are still four times more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. \r\n\r\nMobility will allow 65 male and female elite players to experience the training methods at three UEFA-acknowledged centres of excellence in Austria, Spain and Portugal.

The young people will have the opportunity to  focus on photography as a method for young people to think about their own identity; questioning what concepts of \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 mean to them through expressing themselves through a visual medium. By using photography it will be a fantastic opportunity for young people to learn new skills and is also a way for all young people to communicate regardless of their language skills. Throughout these activities we plan to encourage young people to take ownership of the exchange by also leading their own activities, encouraging participation through a youth centered approach; examples of this will be young people hosting a cultural tour around their home town of Swansea.\r\n\r\nThe first main objective of the exchange is getting to know each other and other cultures. In spite of great cultural differences, youngsters will find a lot of individual similarities. Spending a week together and sharing beautiful and difficult moments, will contribute to a feeling of openness and willingless to learn from others backgrounds and experiences.  \r\n\r\nAnother main objective for the youngsters is to get to know themselves better, feel stronger and more confident, valuing their individuality and feeling empowered to share this diversity with others to break down barriers between different ethnic and religious groups. This is an important objective for all those youngsters involved in the exchange as they will be able to learn from and empower each other to celebrate difference. In a time of growing hostility towards the \u2018other\u2019 within European countries \u2013 the growth of far right sentiment and the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU unfortunately demonstrate this - our youth organisations working together can ensure young people still feel valued within Europe and feel invested in an outward looking approach, committed to being seen as a European or global citizen. \r\n\r\nThe main outcome of the exchange will be a photography exhibition that has been developed and made by the youngsters involved in the exchange. This exhibition will reflect how the youngsters see themselves and their peers. It will be shown in the three countries after the exchange, so that both younger and older people can visit and learn from these issues, importantly from a young person\u2019s perspective. Together with the youngsters, we will prepare a workshop on identity that accompanies the exhibition. The fact that the project continues after the exchange, extends the effect of it. Back at home, youngsters can show the result of the exchange and be, once more, proud of what they did. Our hope being that these young people can lead by example to their home towns as a successful way to encourage intercultural discussion and belonging!", "http://www.eyst.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-BE05-KA105-002119_1"]]}}, "5TZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "MOBILITE EUROPENNE DES STAGIAIRES DE LA FORMATION PROFESSIONNELLE et des ENCADRANTS", "City School of Languages Ltd", 94769.0, 6, 14, "The consortium is led by the \"Maison de l\u2019Europe des Yvelines\" (MdEY) and helped by two other members: \"l'Association Nationale des Missions locales\" (l'ANDML), \"l'Association des Directeurs de Missions Locales du 78\" (l'ADML78) who pool their knowledge and their experience of mobility management, serving youths in vocational training, to develop their staff and their structure to another dimension: the European work market.\r\nObjectives:\r\nFor students of Vocational Training\r\n- Provide opportunities for SFP youths to find their place in society through professional integration, to give hope through a better understanding of their abilities and regain self-esteem through better adaptability to the economic environment.\r\n- Get real professional skills and become employable.\r\n- Acquire \"more baggage\" that gives meaning to their professional, social and cultural life.\r\nFor Supervisors:\r\n- Acquire methods, tools and know-how to contribute to the development of young people to complete a successful mobility period.\r\n- Supporting young people's vocational training in their mobility project\r\n- Recognition of the mobility\u2019s specifications to give it proper recognition and real value with the young people.\r\nWe offer, for 24 SFP youths, a 3 months training period in 3 European countries. This programme runs over a two year period and can be completed in the following countries: United Kingdom, Ireland and Finland. Four departures will be organised in groups of 6 youths to better organise the training prior to departure.\r\nWe offer an internship of 15 days to supervisors in 6 European countries: Spain, Bulgaria, Ireland, United Kingdom, Finland and Germany. The periods are chosen based on availability of supervisors.

With her partner Testenglish and the Surrey Language Center in Farnham, she had a successful experience in Paris with her fully financed ERASMUS+ program.\r\nOur institution is a regional highschool offering a general, technological, and vocational education to about 1200 teenagers. The vocational school proposes a BTEC National in Management and administration, in Trade, in Client and User Relations, and a Professional Vocational Certificate in Catering. Our three BTECs have an English European section. We want that 10 of our students have a 4 week internship abroad each year. The common professional mobility of these two classes would be ensured.\r\nProfessional training throughout life and being open to the E.U. are part of Marlioz project, a strong image that we have been developing for years now. Students apply in these classes to take part to a European teaching program. Our open day, our work with middle schools, our short internships promote this program.\r\nThese future trainees will do the common tasks in management, administration, trade, client and user relations that compose a three year curriculum and will discover a country, a culture, a language and new skills in relation to their future work but different from their usual practices.\r\n\r\nIn the  program girls are on par with boys. The number of students is from 12 to 15. Each student has a distinct profile if we consider the professional skills to develop, the wish to continue to study and the professional integration.\r\nThey are motivated and realize the importance of being open to the E.U. for the trade or for an administrative position. They are aware that it is an undeniable opportunity to be differentiated in the professional world that is European or even more international.\r\nOnce in Fifth year, they participate to European activities. They have a two- hour lesson of Non-linguistic discipline including one hour of co-teaching: vocational teaching in English to gain specialized vocational vocabulary. A Californian English assistant works with them and helps them to pass the Cambridge Certificate. To prepare them to this mobility (a visit and a discovery  of the European institutions in Strasbourg are incorporated). A five day school trip to London allows them to see a European capital. We set up the visit of a school or a company that will offer an overview on the English educational and professional practices. As the principal goal of this mobility is contextual we have a project of comparison of the tourist attractiveness of the city of Aix le Bains and the city of Galway.\r\nWhile in Galway and during 5 days, they will have a pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation. First, Testenglish, will gather the students according to their level and integrate them to the right group for the best progress.\r\nDays are spent on the integration in companies. The supervisors are aware of their role with the trainees. They are ready to help the students to get skills and improve their English. Our students discover the E.U. and its mobilities, Galway, a small town where students enhance their English and learn more. Testenglish covers the accommodation and the work placement for all participants who quickly meet other European students. In Cork, Amazon takes care of the participants.\r\nApart from the need to do an internship abroad to validate the European mention and the Europass formation, it is also to give them the opportunity to discover Europe and the English language in a country, in a school at the crossroads of several cultures.

This means that the students\u2019 families deal with important social problems. Some of our students have met school problems when they were in their secondary schools and they came to our vocational school because they couldn\u2019t study in a traditional high school.\r\n\r\nThese young have lost their school and social landmarks and our role as teachers is to help them to become self-confident anew.

The project steering committee decided that the students preparing a BTEC in Commerce, Sales or Customer Relation would benefit from this innovative career path in a foreign European country. The three branches are part of the European class created in our vocational school and it was thus natural to set up this plan for this school grade and this type of studies.

He acts as a liaison between the international partners, the funding agencies and the DAREIC (School representative for European and international relations)   of the Paris Academy.\r\nIn order to reinforce our commitment to the European culture, we consider it essential that our students enrolled in the Administrative, commercial and security service sector  should do part of their training periods in one or more European countries.\r\nA work experience abroad would be a success factor for our students from disadvantaged backgrounds. This allows our trainees to participate in enriching learning exchanges. An undeniable axis to fight against  dropping out of school.\r\n\r\nIndeed, professional mobility and language acquisition are made a priority for our students because of the internationalization of trade. They enable the students to broaden their professional, cultural and personal horizons. They are also an asset for students wishing to further their education in a Two-Year Technical Degree, where the knowledge of languages is a real advantage.\r\nTherefore, In November 2017 and  2018, 48 students from our school should have the means to do a 5-week training period in British and Spanish companies in United Kingdom and  in Spain.\r\n\r\nTh\u00e9ophile Gautier vocational school wants to offer a new horizon to students of all sectors and not only to those of the European section.
