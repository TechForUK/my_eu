The innovative point is the extended consortium which includes sending partners from the educational and economic sector  in the field of hospitality and tourism on the national level (6 Slovenian secondary vocational schools for catering and tourism and  Tourism and Hospitality Chamber of Slovenia- Association of Hoteliers of Slovenia) in order to reinforce the cooperation between both sectors and ensure a synergic effect of the mobility experience gained by all key target groups involved: students, teachers and staff in enterprises-mentors of internships.\r\n\r\nThe main goals of the project are:\r\n\r\n- to enhance internationalization  of the consortium partners and thus contribute to the promotion and increase of mobility\r\n\r\n- to raise the attractiveness and quality of teaching/learning  of foreign languages focused on multilingualism, intercultural competencies and the use if ICT\r\n\r\n- to contribute to more transparent and unified evaluation ,acknowledgement and certification of the learning outcomes  acquired during the mobility by using the national and European tools\r\n\r\n- to increase the competitiveness and employability of the mobility participants by providing them with specific knowledge and international experience  \r\n\r\n-to promote the shortage occupations cook and waiter\r\n\r\n- to get insight into new trends and needs of the hospitality sector on the European labour market (\u00abNew skills for new jobs\u00ab) by exchanging examples of good practice\r\n\r\nThe target groups of mobility participants are:\r\n\r\n- Students in secondary VET (gastronomy and tourism programmes): 38 students plus 6 accompanying persons\r\n\r\n- Teachers of foreign languages, professional subjects and practical classes: 23\r\n\r\n- Mentors of internships in enterprises/hotels: 12\r\n\r\nThe project activities will differ according to the target group and will include:\r\n\r\n- internship in host hotels, language course , cultural activities and excursions (students)\r\n\r\n- presentations of new teaching methods and workshops , sightseeing, cultural activities, socializing (teachers of foreign languages)\r\n\r\n- participation in the Euroskills course and workshops,sightseeing, cultural activities, socializing (teachers of professional subjects, practical classes)\r\n\r\n- exchange of good practices, visits of hotels and  discussions with mentors of internship on organization, implementation and evaluation/certification of internships , sightseeing and cultural activities (mentors from Slovenian hotels)\r\n\r\nThe main expected result of the project for all participants are new and improved  competencies in  their professional field of work, communication skills in foreign languages  and  intercultural awareness as well as their increased motivation for further education and training based on the positive mobility experience. Another important result  is the unified and transparent  acknowledgement and certification of the mobility learning outcomes within the consortium . New ideas and suggestions for joint future projects are expected to emerge from this project, too. \r\n\r\nThe most important long-term impact of the project is the establishment of a good basis for the future cooperation between the educational and economic  sector in the field of hospitality  and for enhancing the  internationalization process of the partners involved. \r\n\r\nAnd, last but not least the project can serve as an example how to take the advantages of the new features of Erasmus + to give the national and sectorial dimension to mobility experience within one single project.", "http://www.2clix.net", null, "erasmus_2014-1-SI01-KA102-000257_12"], ["3NR", "QUAL.IS.BAS: Qualit\u00e0 dell'Istruzione in Basilicata", "Alec Hunter Academy", 148267.0, "The project QUAL.IS.BAS is co-ordinated by the Regional Education Authority  for the Basilicata region (USR).

The USR, through this consortium, involves three secondary schools located in Potenza: IIS \u201cNitti\u201d, IIS \u201cDa Vinci\u201d and Liceo Scientifico \u201cGalilei\u201d that have often cooperated with the USR and have distinguished themselves for the quality of their initiatives over the course of years, and two partner schools in Sweden, one in France and another one in Great Britain.\r\nThe three member schools of the consortium share a strong interest in internationalization that is expressed by the headmistresses  and teachers\u2019 tireless commitment to the promotion of innovative practices and a more open outlook on different cultures. Moreover, a large number of teachers who are attending CLIL language courses organized by the USR work in these schools.\r\nThe objectives of the project are to encourage: a) the CLIL methodology training of a large number of teachers who have been involved mainly in English language courses so far, since the teaching of CLIL modules is compulsory in the final year of Secondary school; b) foreign language teachers\u2019 refresher courses in the field of language teaching; c) the linguistic methodological competence improvement of the teachers working in ESABAC French courses; d) the ATA personnel and curricular teachers\u2019 knowledge of English and French. In all, we are involving 90 people working in the  three schools, both teaching and non-teaching staff, in activities that refer to the three typologies of Key Action 1- School Education Staff Mobility, that is courses, teaching assignments and job shadowing. The results of this project, which will develop in the course of 24 months, include the increase in European and intercultural training experiences, the improvement of the formative offer of Secondary schools, the acquisition of new teaching methodological strategies, greater motivation and flexibility of teachers, and the enhancement of the language competences of all those who are responsible for both the reception and the administration and accounts of incoming and outgoing mobility.\r\nThe long term results concern the improvement of  the quality of teaching so that it may become more involving and motivating and more Europe oriented, giving the right opportunities to expand the teaching content through an intercultural approach, transnational cooperation and the collaboration on teaching material. Furthermore, thanks to this project, the USR wants to favour the internationalization of Basilicata schools increasing the development of the school system with the aim of making the consortium an excellence hub the other schools of the region may consult about professional development programmes of the same profile.", "http://www.alechunter.com", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IT02-KA101-014337_3"], ["4AH", "Language skills and intercultural issues in the hospitality industry: unity in diversity in the EU labour market", "Primrose Publishing Limited", 228156.0, "Contemporary world shows a change in the employability patterns and skills needed in the future. Cedefop\u2019s latest skill supply and demand forecasts (2014) highlight Europe\u2019s employment challenge indicating that the most job opportunities will be in services, and point to a rising trend towards high-skilled jobs. Moreover, the increasing tourism flows, mobility for study and professional reasons as well as global migration processes have placed Europe in a previously unknown situation in which multilingualism is becoming not a desired state but a vital necessity. Communication in many languages is not any longer regarded as an aim but is considered as a tool for participating in socially meaningful activities in everyday and professional setting. Language skills, intercultural and digital competences are important employability skills in the current situation, especially in tourism and hospitality sector. This also requires new innovative ways for developing VET learners\u2019 employability skills to be competitive in the changing labour market and contribute to cohesive society. This idea lies at the core of the current project, the stimulus for which was our previous project \u201eKey Skills for Hotel Industry Staff\u201d in which we focussed on developing language course for hospitality industry employees in 12 languages. The current project is intended to elaborate and put forward the results attained in the first project and by attracting new partners it is extending the scope as well and bringing the results a step further.This project addresses the specific objectives of the Erasmus+ programme in the field of education and training: 1) to improve the level of key competences and skills (employability skills, language and intercultural competence), with particular regard to their relevance for the labour market (tourism and hospitality industry) and their contribution to a cohesive society (providing better cultural awareness and increased language competence, including in remote areas); 2) improve the teaching and learning of languages and promote the EU's broad linguistic diversity (16 languages are targeted) and intercultural awareness (language teaching/learning materials integrating culture of European countries, including minority groups (ethnic Hungarian region of Romania) and creativity in language learning.Nine partners are involved in the project: two vocational schools \u2013 Turisticka i ugostiteljska skola from Dubrovnik, Croatia and IPSSA Nino Bergese, Genoa, Italy; two higher vocational schools - Ekonomska sola Murska Sobota, VSS from Slovenia and Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed odborn\u00e1 \u0161kola, St\u0159edn\u00ed pr\u016fmyslov\u00e1 \u0161kola a Obchodn\u00ed akademie, \u010c\u00e1slav, from the Czech Republic; three tertiary level education institutions - Biznesa augstskola Turiba, Latvia; UNIVERSITATATEA SAPIENTIA DIN CLUJ NAPOCA, Romania and V\u0161\u012e Vilniaus verslo kolegija, Lithuania; Provincial Directorate of Education in Turkey Kutahya MEM; and Primrose Publishing, an enterprise from the UK.The project aims at creating an interactive blended learning language course \u201eUnity in Diversity\u201d comprising on-line learning materials available on the Moodle Learning platform and face-to-face interactive materials incorporating case studies, games, problem-solving tasks, videos, etc. targeted at developing VET learners\u2019 language, intercultural and digital competence, creativity, problem-solving skills and flexibility. The complete course is formed up by three courses: 1) a new interactive A1 language learning course in 16 languages (CZ, DE, EN, ES, FR, GR, HR, HU, IT, LT, LV, RO, RU, SE, Si, TR) containing such modules as \u201cWelcome\u201d, \u201cHotel\u201d, \u201cRestaurant\u201d, \u201cProfessional skills\u201d; 2) A2/B1 language course extended to 16 languages comprising such modules as \u201cHotel Reception\u201d, \u201cRestaurant\u201d, \u201cRestaurant Kitchen\u201d, \u201cCity\u201d, \u201cHotel Business Centre\u201d and \u201cManagement Offices\u201d, the first two also as smartphone apps, the module \u201cCity\u201d accompanied by 3 interactive maps and 3 inside hotel maps; 3) B2/C1 intercultural English language course comprising 8 modules \u201cHotel Front Office\u201d, \u201cCatering Service\u201d, Hotel Management\u201d, \u201cConference and Business Services\u201d, \u201cOff-site Services\u201d and \u201cFinancial Management\u201d, an intercultural module revealing cultural sensitivities of the nine partner countries and nine country modules featuring the main tourist information required for work; the course contains case studies, videos, on-line modules and face-to-face problem-based tasks.

It will not only provide hotel staff with a range of answers to these and other questions in 12 most popular languages used in tourism and hospitality business but also provide similar answers to guests\u2019 questions in a restaurant, an impressive array of materials in 12 languages as well as a learning program and an on-line English course for those in the hospitality sector and tourism and hospitality students thereby increasing their competences and employability.\r\n\r\nSix partners are involved in the project: Turiba University from Latvia specializing in business, including tourism and hospitality management; Ekonomska \u0161ola, a tertiary education institution from Slovenia providing business education; Sapientia University from the Hungarian-speaking part of Romania - providing a wide spectrum of study programmes; IPSSA Nino Bergese, a hotel school from Genoa, Italy; Turisticka i ugostiteljska skola, a hotel and catering school from Dubrovnik, Croatia; and Primrose Publishing from England that created the original program and smartphone apps.\r\n\r\nApart from the two computer programs and two apps containing answers to guests' questions in 12 languages, the activities include relevant lexis necessary at restaurants and an in-depth survey of cultural sensitivities in all European countries and thereby avoid causing offence and distress. Digital maps will be created showing hotels in three locations: in a rural countryside, by the seasside and at a ski resort in the mountains that will help to learn a language using innovative approach. Spoken presentations about the three fictitious villages and their hotels will be created and made available in the 12 languages. All the materials that are created will be available during the project free of charge as a learning program, both on-line as well as on a DVD, in all the languages. Copies of the DVD will be obtainable by contacting the partners. At a more advanced level, both of language and experience, tasks will be created for an on-line English course covering six key areas of responsibility in managing a hotel. \r\n\r\nA project web-site will be created, and a comprehensive and challenging dissemination programme will be undertaken.

They belong to distinct communities( geographically, socially, economically, culturally) , a real melting-pot. We can estimate that over over 100 students will be directly involved and more than 1000 will be indirectly involved.\r\n\r\nThe activities will be: - Welcome letters;  a web blog about the project (teachers) ; designing of the project logo and slogan; exploring the history of Human Rights; celebration of  UN\u00b4s Day of Human Rights;  exploring the meaning of the human rights through philosphical dialogue; organizing a human rights Club - \"Human Rights are us\" (this can initiate and organise activities and actions concerning human rightsi in the school or local community);T-shirt of the club (that will be used during the Club actions and visits); doing research (interview/questionnaire etc.) on the status of human rights in the school yard, in the local community and in their home country; exploring the phenomenon of stereotyping (engaging the students in a dialogue about how stereotyping can limit people\u2019s freedom; taking action for human rights in cooperation with Amnesty International or any other NGO.\r\n\r\nThe methodology we are going to use is : the school from Portugal will be the coordinator. It will ensure that all the information is properly sent and received by all partners. It will check the particular steps of the project , make necessary changes, etc. \r\nAll the schools will promote the activities planned and an intensive use of ICT will be fundamental for the communication among the participants and dissemination  of the results. There will be 5 transnational meetings with the participation of 2 teachers and 5 students.\r\n\r\nThe results will be tangible and intangible.: Tangible - Social networks( facebook restrict group);a blog;  videos on YouTube channel; Reports; leaflets; exhibitions; school club on Human Rights; NGO school campaign; project corner. Intangible - knowledge and experience acquired; development of language and ICT skills; better awareness of the question arisen; development of initiative, creativity, cooperation; proactivity; entrepreneurship; development of ethical attitudes; development of dialogical skills.\r\n\r\nConcerning the impact of the project and potential longer term benefits, students and teachers  will become more aware of the differents aspects of human rights and they will learn how important it is to involve yourself by respecting and fighting for human rights in everyday life.  By meeting people from other cultures both students and teachers will also get to know different ways of thinking and the status of human rights in different countries.  During the activities they will think about their own attitudes and behaviour, and this might lead to a deeper understanding and change of attitude. The students and teachers will get experience in taking action, and this may empower them to take actively part in the struggle for human rights on a daily basis. For the participating organizations, Amnesty International and other local ones, the fact that we want to work with them and take part in their actions might be an encouragement in the way that they will have more support and publicity.

We know that international dialogue, peace, tolerance are necessary virtues to solve many troubles that we encounter. To see differences as a source of richness prevents the extinction of other cultures in such a global world. \r\nAs teachers we observed the students for a long time and found out that the students do not know much about their own cultures and they have no idea about the cultures of other European countries.We met in etwinning and launched an etwinning project.Then we wanted to transform it into an Erasmus+ project to reach wider school groups and the communities.\r\nOne of the main aims of the project is to raise the students' awareness towards other cultures, encourage students to learn different foreign languages, stimulate all the partners to make use of the ICT tools of communication, so as to improve their competence in this area. A more intensive European cooperation will be achieved by getting to know each partner and learning about each other\u2019s culture.\r\nAnother main aim of our project is to make the students with disadvantaged backgrounds feel proud of themselves . They will take part in the national activities ,sports,festivals and workshops actively .\r\nThe project will help the partners to develop multicultural understanding and awareness of the other communities. By sharing experiences together during the project meetings and participating to different activities teachers and students will have the chance to get involved in different ,interesting and enjoyable opportunity to spend time with their European partners.\r\nA high appreciation of the role of students and teaching staff will be increased by the local and regional communities within the European Community.\r\nAll our activities are student oriented and focuses mainly on student involvement.They can be accomplished with their participation from various backrounds and equal number of genders.As partners, we believe that the project activities will be fully integrated into each institution\u2019s curriculum through daily lessons and thematic projects.\r\nOur project includes many activities about art, music,dance,food, lifestyles and sports. By covering different fields we intend to highlight the cultural items and cultural differences. This is necessary both for those  who should learn their own culture and who should compare their culture with others as well. \r\nThere will be six schools from six different European countries in the project. Scoala Gimnaziala Nr.1 Branesti is the coordinator . UK, Turkey, Portugal, Croatia and Poland are the partner countries.\r\nThe results can be summarized as follows : A presentation about each country will be created by partners. Students in each country will make three dimensional models about their historical places and they will exhibit them.They will also create a jingle of the project that will be presented during its development. Also the symbol of the project will be designed by students. The best symbol will be chosen and picturised on magnets.Other results we expect are a project corner, painting contest,essay contest,t-shirt designing contest about cultural diversity, audio-visual daily multi-language dictionary (pupils will study and vocalize other countries' daily expressions and we record the audios during the student exchange event in Romania then combine all of them in an online dictionary) ,European dictionary,cultural game created with Strach coding(Polish students will teach other students during the student exchange in UK,newspapers to be created by students at the end of each year,teaching the national sports,traditional food and folk dance of all the partner countries to the students of other schools. \r\nEach school will establish a Diversity Club. Students meet every week and discuss issues of diversity and design activities to introduce various culture groups within the school.Students will embrace and celebrate their similarities and differences while fighting against bullying via the school's diversity club. The club consists of students who want to spread cultural acceptance through their school and community.  \r\nWe will share the outputs such as presentations, leaflets, audio-visual daily language dictionary and different contests etc on twinspace,on the project website and youtube. Therefore we will make access possible for everyone who wants to see the concrete results of the project and learn about it.
