The overall goal of SafeConsumE is to provide effective, science-based and sustainable strategies for food authorities, market actors and the research community to help consumers mitigate risk, thus reducing the health burden from food-borne illness in Europe. SafeconsumE will suggest, develop and evaluate:  \n1) Tools, technologies and products (e.g. sensors, apps, hygiene concepts, kitchen utensils) that stimulate safe practices;\n2) Communication strategies that effectively stimulate adoption and market uptake of safer practices and tools/technologies; \n3) Education programs increasing skills and knowledge aiding teenagers to handle food safely;\n4) Dynamic, sustainable and inclusive policy models that stimulates and support national and EU level initiatives.\nTo achieve high implementation and innovation power, scientists will work together with consumers, authorities and different market actors under a new trans-disciplinary and multi-actor approach based on Theories of Practices combined with Design-driven innovation. Covering the five most important hazards causing food borne disease, consumer behavior across Europe will be described using a risk-based methodology and utilizing the strengths of high-throughput surveys together with in-depth qualitative methodology. New strategies will be developed taking into account their impact on risk reduction, documented consumer barriers for change and sustainability. SafeConsumE will support transformation towards a more healthy population and cost-efficacy by reduced foodborne illness, and a more sustainable community by less food-waste and environmentally friendly solutions.", 49105.0, 8293260.0, "SafeConsumE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_210495_921278065"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6XL", "INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC FORUM ON HOME HYGIENE", 49064.0, "Securing sufficient supplies of safe, healthy and high quality food and other bio-based products (08.02.03.02)", "fts_2017_2583", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "TA15"}
