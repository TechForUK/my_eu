Waste2Go will valorise this heterogeneous material that has significant socio-economic costs. It will involve the innovative transformation of  over 55% of MSW, the biogenic fraction, into renewable chemicals, advancing beyond current approaches to bio-refining which employ crop derived feedstocks. A cascade approach will be adopted to maximise value. Annually >180 million tonnes of MSW are discarded in the EU27, (in excess of 1kg per citizen every day). Waste2Go will develop technologies to improve waste management and increase value (social, economic & environmental). This will be validated as Best Available Technology (BAT) by recognised LCA experts. It will extend beyond the state-of-the-art in enzyme based technologies for fine-tuned biomass processing and combine them with intelligent techniques for MSW fractionation and downstream processing. It will unlock economic value from MSW and reduce its serious environmental impacts. MSW will become a sustainable source of raw materials for the chemical industry, replacing fossil sources. It will advance leading EU expertise in:\n1) Enzyme research, on rapid and controlled substrate digestion;\n2) Bioprocess engineering and;\n3) Advanced purification techniques, to maximise value.\nThis project will improve the competitiveness of SMEs in the waste management sector; a sector with the highest proportion of SMEs and the lowest proportion of valued added of any EU industrial sector, although worth over \u20ac100 billion p.a. and employing over 1.2 million people.\nThe consortium involves five SMEs, two research institutes and one multinational company providing market pull.

PROFESSIONAL (18-21 yrs)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the YOUTH Development phase, 16-18 year old (male) Apprentices and primarily seeks to enhance PLAYER DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESSION through European input around best practices as well as extend the GAMES PROGRAMME to encompass non UK styles and approaches. Supplementary to this focus is an aim to learn from other European Clubs/Governing bodies in order to improve on a number of the other key development areas including VISION, COACHING, SPORT SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, and FACILITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis group of YOUTH players undertake the Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (ASE) programme, a recognised government funded vocational qualification which is delivered and managed by MFC in conjunction with League Football Education (LFE). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLFE's research shows that of all ASE learners (1300 at any one time across the country) approximately 60% of players don't receive a professional contract upon completion of the ASE programme. Also, of the 40% that do gain a professional contract, 50% of those do not receive a second contract. This means that of the original cohort 80% are not in professional football a year after completing the programme. There is also an ever increasing influx of foreign players moving to the English Leagues with minimal movement in the other direction. There are consistently poor performances by the National Side in international competitions, especially when compared to investment levels in training. Finally, the issue of senior players coming out of the game and needing to retrain (our current coaching staff being good examples) needs to be further recognised and supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads to the following participant specific aims for the project: \r\n\r\n1. To achieve both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the development of the participants as footballers \r\n\r\n2. To improve the knowledge and understanding of Lifelong Learning principles within Apprentices \r\n\r\n3. To improve the knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in football and other careers \r\n\r\n4. To deliver a high quality social and cultural programme including exposure to the language within the host country \r\n\r\n5.

However, regardless of the level of success achieved in football, Apprentices receive advice and education that provide a solid platform from which they can move forward and make sound decisions in life. The framework for this education is the Advanced Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme, a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people with the realistic potential to achieve excellence in sport or a career outside of professional football.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at MFC. Working with host partner VVV Venlo in Holland the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives:\r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the MFC AASE programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n2) Exposing Apprentices to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n3) Embedding Lifelong Learning Principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip Apprentices with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 22 (male) Apprentices undertaking the MFC AASE programme in the 2018/19 football season (i.e. the 2017 and 2018 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their football ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic  circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at the Venlo's facility, including:\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets.\r\n- Games versus high quality Dutch youth teams.\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\nVVV Venlo has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable MFC to enhance the work placement activities of participants.

In a world where environmental concerns are increasingly important, it was felt that students needed opportunities to see how to incorporate sustainable practice into their enterprise. As our previous project focused heavily on industry and enterprise, students have gained a good understanding of this theme and therefore our new project will focus more heavily on themes of sustainability and responsible management of our environment, showing students how these issues can be tackled with enterprise.\r\n\r\nObjectives of Project\r\nTo provide opportunities for students to develop the skills, knowledge and understanding  that will shape them into responsible, eco-friendly members of society.\r\nTo provide opportunities for our students to develop entrepreneurial skills\r\nTo provide young people with the opportunity to travel to other countries to promote tolerance and understanding  of their own and other countries cultures. \r\nTo provide teachers and other professionals with opportunities to work collaboratively, share best practice and improve their knowledge and understanding of employment issues and cultural diversity.\r\nTo provide parents and the local community with opportunities to become involved in the project. \r\nTo provide young people with the opportunity to develop their language and communication skills in a practical context.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of Participants\r\nThe project will include students and professionals from seven different partner schools:\r\nEngland - Priory Woods School and Arts College.
