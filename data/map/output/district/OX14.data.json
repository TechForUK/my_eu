The engineered soluble TCRs directed against specific beta cell antigen epitopes have been synthesised and the first experiments in mice using interleukin 4 (IL4) and IL13 fusions have been completed. Data on IL4 and IL13 were disappointing as treatment with these TCRs could not delay diabetes recurrence in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-known animal model for human T1D.

This is because spores play the pivotal role in the spread of infection (eg, C. difficile) and in foodstuff contamination and food poisoning (eg, C. botulinum and C. perfringens). The processes of spore formation (sporulation) and germination (return of the dormant spore to toxin-producing, vegetative cells), therefore, represent key intervention points. On the other hand, the majority of clostridia are entirely benign and can sustainably produce all manner of useful chemicals and fuels. Crucially, the regulation of chemical production is intimately linked to that of sporulation. Spores of benign species may also be used as a delivery system for treating cancer. Yet, despite the spore\u2019s importance, little is known of the developmental processes of sporulation and germination.

We believe that by introducing professional mobility through the Erasmus+ programme (that is to say by creating the opportunity to study health and youth studies in a foreign country) it  will make the subject and vocational training more attractive and increase the quality of our vocational program and ensure that students complete their training. In addition, we strongly believe that this kind of programme will result in a greater demand and uptake from students interested in vocational training. \r\n\r\nThe students will develop richer knowledge and skills and an entirely different perspective on health and youth studies. The programme will allow students to see both similarities and differences in their vocational training programs and to reflect on new practical approaches within their respective vocations.\r\n\r\nOutplacement incorporates many elements of a young person\u2019s socialization process and allows them to build a core set of social skills such as empathy, respect and tolerance. These are key social skills that are included as part of the school\u2019s existing outplacement training. Outplacement is also about cooperation, group processes and conflict management. In addition, the student can use the outplacement experience as career guidance for future professions.\r\n\r\nImportant learning goals:  Areas for VG2 Heath Care workers and VG2 Child and Youth workers:\r\n\u2022 Understand and respect other people\u2019s culture, religion and economic means (how unemployment or poverty affects patients, children and youth)\r\n\u2022 Perform basic nursing skills\r\n\u2022 Special attention to hygiene in the workplace\r\n\u2022 Perform duties in such a way as to create an environment of trust and credibility and that fosters a positive dialogue between patients and family members.\r\n\u2022 Communicate and interact with patients \r\n\u2022 Observe, reflect and report\r\n\u2022 Perform tasks in line with professional ethical guidelines \r\n\u2022 Ensure patient participation \r\n\u2022 Perform tasks in compliance with existing legal frameworks as well as the plans and routines of a specific workplace.\r\n\u2022 Observe and participate in activities that are of psychological and physical significance to the patient.\r\n\u2022 Observe and participate in activities with children and youth that lead to learning, development and socialization.\r\nTotal number of participants: The project is designed for four VG2 students during the Spring term of the 2015/2016 academic year and for four students during the Spring of 2016/2017 academic year. \r\nTwo teachers/counsellors will participate along with the students.\r\n\r\nProject Content:\r\nThe mobility piece of this project is will occur over a two week period through a program element called \u00abProject Specialization\u00bb.  This will involve a practical session at a health care facility or kindergarten in Oxford.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nThe project will be implemented for the four students who will be selected after an application process. In their application, students will be required to set their own success criteria for participation in the programme. This input will be an important part of the selection process in order that the school can select the best, most highly motivated candidates.\r\n\r\nThe first selection process will occur during the Autumn of 2015 or in early 2016.

At the same time, the project will elaborate guidelines and new methodologies in order to open the road for a more extensive use of  dual learning system. The target group to whom the project is addressed are students in vocational training path and young workers in wood and furniture sector. The project will contribute to adapt curriculum and qualification profiles by investigating the technological and soft skills gap in the professional profiles for the Wood Treaters, Cabinet Makers and related Trade Workers, increasing organizational, social, emotional, entrepreneurial and technological skills and competences in VET students and workers. A cooperation framework between different stakeholders (especially enterprises/employers and VET institutions) will be tested to define integrated transnational dual learning models: one model would not fit every situation, but a core concept can be proposed, accompanied by a \u201cmodelling engine\u201d to support adaptation to several sectors and countries. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to produce an increased cooperation and dialogue between VET institutions and experts, companies and policy makers and institutional actors, a shaped knowledge and vision on qualifications and training process in the wood and forniture sector, an institutionalized and effective partnership and transferable framework applied to wood and furniture sector to be transferred and adapted to other important sectors in which dual learning is significant and represents an added value. Finally the project is expected to produce an effective strategy supporting a better school to work transition and facilitating young people entering in European labour market, improving their competences, qualifications and mobility across Europe.\r\nThe first part of the project deals with a comparative and systematic analysis of the state of the art regarding the training and professional profiles in wood and furniture sector.

Little attention has so far been paid to the roles and competences of people who carry out assessment, yet this can present barriers to recognition when crediting learning abroad. Understanding more about these issues would help to develop trust between education and training systems across Member States which in turn would help to underpin the transnational recognition of qualifications in general, and the implementation of ECVET for transnational mobility in specific. \r\n\r\nFocusing on IVET qualifications at EQF levels 3 and 4, the project would therefore seek to address the following questions:\r\n\u2013Who carries out assessments for VET programmes and how?  \r\n\u2013To what extent are assessors required to hold specific qualifications, be members of a recognised profession, and be subject to regulation and meet specific standards of professional conduct?\r\n\u2013What (occupational) standards, qualifications and learning outcomes exist for those who carry out assessments?\r\n\u2013Are the requirements for assessors comparable between countries, and between parts of the vocational system within the same country? \r\n\u2013Are there differences based on the type of system, the sector, or the country setting the requirements?\r\n\r\nThe project will engage stakeholders involved in the assessment of VET, including further education colleges, VET colleges and appropriate regulatory authorities.

Moreover, e-learning so far has not received much attention within quality assessment procedures. The understanding of concrete learning behaviour and uses of electronic courseware and online resources is an important prerequisite to assess the quality of autonomous, lifelong learning. \r\nAnother challenge are the high dropout rates associated with e-learning, not in the least where MOOCs are concerned. Among numerous other variables, an important factor is the lack of engagement and motivation, since students don\u2019t know how they are progressing and what their peers\u2019 achievements over time are. Students involved in e-learning often have a limited knowledge of their own learning habits and which rate of studying with the online material is required. To succeed in (semi-)autonomous learning, however, a higher level of self-regulation is needed.\r\n\r\nThis project proposal addresses the Erasmus + challenge of raising the quality of education through the use of learning analytics. Learning analytics is a new and promising research field which can be defined as \u201cthe measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners in their context, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environment in which it occurs\u201d (Siemens et. Al). The recent evolution of web-based learning and the possibility of tracking students\u2019 online behaviour offers promising new ways of measuring actual self-study activities. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to establish a clear image of how higher education students in different European countries learn online. The goal is to map existing learning patterns in 4 different types of online language learning and teaching and maths courses and to feed back this new knowledge to the most important educational actors themselves, being the students and their lecturers. We want to use a bottom-up learning analytics approach taking the perspective of the learning process, focusing on the courses used and the students\u2019 learning trails through these courses, and intend to use process mining techniques for the analysis of the data. Therefore, a complimentary and cross-disciplinary consortium of teams from three universities and a private open source company was set up.\r\nTogether, they will first implement tracking of learning data based on the new Experience API standard for interoperability with other learning environments (e.g. mobile apps, games) and reporting tools. After a piloting phase, the learning behavior of several student groups enrolled in distance learning or university programmes with an important self-study component will be tracked during one semester. The data will be collected in a central repository (Learning Record store). An important point of concern in the project will be the privacy of the students who will be monitored. Participants will be asked to give their consent to collect and use their data for the aims that will be clearly described. The data will be kept anonymous and the EU data protection directive will be taken into account.\r\nIn a fourth phase we aim to analyse the processes of autonomous learning comparing them to the intended pedagogic objectives of the tools. Patterns of learning behaviour will be detected, based on which different user profiles can be identified and feedback about used learning resources can be obtained.\r\nFinally, data visualisation tools will be developed and implemented in order to create a learning dashboard application for students and for teachers. Special care will be given to ease of use of the dashboards for non-specialist users. These applications will allow both the teachers and the students to understand how they learn online but also to compare their profile to user patterns of their peers. Educators get dynamic and real-time overviews of how their students are progressing, which students might be at risk of dropping out or of failing for the course and which parts of the courses cause difficulties/require more feedback.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at the development of a generic model for implementing learning analytics in interactive e-learning tools, which can be reused in different educational settings, countries, courses.
