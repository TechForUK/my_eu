Our specific objective is equipping young social entrepreneurs to become more impactful through improving their capacity on social impact analysis. Our strategy is to create an awareness among social entrepreneurs and eco-system developers, to increase access to knowledge by developing materials in native languages, and to increase skills of social entrepreneurs by providing training and coaching program.Our target group is young start-up social entrepreneurs as many social entrepreneurship leaders are young and even though they are inspired, they are not much experienced in defining and measuring societal objectives, which results less public benefit, less public support and less funding. Young start-up social entrepreneurs have much potential and energy, but no experience. Without guidance, the risk to fail is high. In addition, start- up social entrepreneurs are focused on their business models and getting funding rather than tracking their social impact. That is why, we need to establish necessary mechanism to support these young social entrepreneurs.The Europe 2020 strategy recognizes entrepreneurship and self-employment as key for achieving smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and several flagship initiatives address them (www.ec.europa.ec). In its support to entrepreneurship and self-employment, the EC focuses its efforts on business start-ups by unemployed and people from disadvantaged groups, sustainability and quality of work of self-employed businesses and micro-entrepreneurs; and support for social entrepreneurs. According to the Eurostat, youth unemployment rate is 23.4 % in the Euro Area. The concept of social entrepreneurship might be an alternative way to strengthen the situation of young people in the EU. In the face of increasing economic, social and environmental pressures it could be rightfully argued that social entrepreneurship should be on the agenda of both non-governmental and business organizations.The project would consist of three consecutive parts:In a first phase running until the end of 2015 the project would conduct a comprehensive and complementary need analysis report among social entrepreneurs in Estonia and in Turkey through workshops among social entrepreneurs (in total 20 participants) and ecosystem developers (in total 30 participants), expert interviews (in total 30 participants) and a study of online social impact communication (in total 150-300 social businesses) before developing the social impact analysis framework and the training tools and program (Social Impact Analysis Guide).In a second phase ending in July 2016 the project would develop a social impact analysis framework, a comprehensive training tools and program (Social Impact Analysis Guide), select 15 young social entrepreneurs from Estonia, and 15 from Turkey to participate to the program, conduct an international training boot camp in Turkey with the participation of these 30 young social entrepreneurs and 11 trainers.In the third and last phase ending in July 2017 the project would develop the best practices on social impact analysis for social entrepreneurs with monitoring-evaluation and coaching program; and disseminate (dissemination conferences with 195 participants in total), promote the project outputs to increase the capacity of young social entrepreneurs on social impact analysis at national and European levels.The expected results on participants and participant organisations include:Increased awareness of the benefits of social impact analysis among ecosystem developers, social entrepreneurs and social investors.Increased skills of young start-up social entrepreneurs on social impact analysisIncreased training and coaching capacity on social impact analysis of ecosystem developersIncreased access to knowledge on social impact analysis among ecosystem developers, social entrepreneurs and social investors.Increased peer learning opportunities between social entrepreneurs via training and social impact web portalThe main outputs of the project, \u201csocial impact analysis framework, training tools and program (social impact analysis guide), best practice compendium on best social impact analysis cases for the use of the young social entrepreneurs and ecosystem developers such as social investors, social entrepreneurship centers, socially entrepreneur civil society organizations\u201d, will be shared on the social impact web portal developed during the project as a resource and knowledge center.

The media and social networks have a huge impact and power on individuals, groups and society and we need to reflect on the positive changes as well as the  risks this new digital reality implies for  its younger users. Participating in the information society requires digital skills in order to prevent exclusion and to reduce the digital gap, which may also become a source of new inequalities. Therefore, we consider digital citizenship as a priority objective for  the schools of the 21st century. \r\nWe intend to use the impact of the media and ICT to promote common positive values, improve the quality of our curricula and contribute to a better school environment. By looking at how participating countries are addressing an issue which affects directly our students\u00b4 personal development and their relationships within our school environment, our project will be complementary to   the work already carried out by school staff and management in that field. \r\nBy working together, participants from socio-economically and culturally diverse countries of Europe (Italy, Poland, Spain, Latvia, Turkey, UK and Greece) will collect relevant data and analyze the impact of the media, Internet and social networks on students, schools and our community as a whole.

The delegation of teachers will be accompanied by four students who will also get the opportunity to experience school life and the application of different teaching approaches at a school abroad. After that, teachers and students will return home and teachers will implement and practice the application of at least one of these new methods in their school life. To ensure that there is a broad implementation in their own school they will involve other teachers in this phase. So all in all, 16 teachers of each country will bring home eight new methods to try out. During the implementation phase, there will be a regular monitoring of the results, the achievements and the problems at each school including a survey of the students who have taken part in lessons that included the new methods. But there will also be a regular exchange of the results at each school between the participating schools via email and skype, so problems can be solved and improvements can be found. At the end of the project, teachers of all schools will come together again and report on their experiences with the new methods. Therefore not only the schools to whom this method was new can profit and learn but also the expert school where the method originally came from as they can learn from mistakes, problems and solutions that came up in the implementation phase.

The schools' answer to the challenges of nowadays society is unfortunately delayed. There is a gap between the pace of the society and the school`s adaptation, still very rooted in tradition. The identified needs in all partner schools highlight the urgent actions that our schools must adapt related to:increasing the students' motivation to learn, linking an old and rigid school curriculum with the skills required by the new society,learning barrier that students from at-risk groups have to overcome. Our project aims to develop the capacity of 5 European schools to collaborate at transnational level to capitalize experiences and best practices in order to develop transversal key competencies in students (age 12-15 years old) by developing and testing a toolkit for implementing the flipped classroom methodology, based on using ICT&OER and creating a more active learning environment, in a period of 2 years.The target groups involve not only students(age 12-15 years) belonging to vulnerable groups such economic disadvantaged, migrants, with learning difficulties and special needs, but also high skilled students;  teachers involved are working with students with very different backgrounds. The project activities are organised in 3 transversal WP related to Management, M&E and Dissemination (24 months) and 6 operational WP to develop specific activities, achieve the project objectives and build the project results. The proposed activities provide a fluent development of the participants` skills and a \"psychological continuity\" of their professional growth in implementing the flipped methodology: the tools preparation (first project year) and implementation phase (second project year). The training/learning activities, strongly embedded in the logic of project, develop the participants\u2019 skills on methodology using collaboration and good practices shared. Each transnational training activity is followed by practical activities developed locally, in order to design resources/inputs for the project results. These resources will be tested and improved during the learning activities, in international groups of students, mandatory in embedding the diversity of students\u2019 needs. This strategy of the project implementation allows the project results building step by step, each pocket activity delivering intermediate results. The project methodology is based on the concepts and tools of the Project Cycle Management in order to provide high quality results and fulfilling the objectives.The ToolKit for implementing the flipped methodology (eBook) will provide the methodological support for implementing the flipped classroom.The Case Study: flipped and traditional classrooms compared - specificity of the partnership schools will collect conclusions of implementing the same curricula using flipped and traditional classroom, in each partner school. The Project website will be a dissemination tool and a space for learning for interested stakeholders. Newsletters, press conferences, events will also provide to information about the project activities and its results.Five training activities/5 days joint staff training events and five learning activities for students/5 days short term exchange of students will bring the principles and necessary skills to implement the flipped methodology.  This could be a unique occasion for 20 students from vulnerable groups to take part in an international experience and collaborate with EU peers.Students will develop their transversal skills such as the ability to think critically, take initiative, problem solving and work collaboratively, taking responsibilities and decision making, ICT skills. A model of how technologies can be used in learning, personal development and lifelong learning will be developed. Teachers will increase their abilities in designing strategies based on using of ICT&OER and creating a more active learning environment, focused on the students\u2019 needs. The relationship between teachers and students, based on a more deeply understanding of the students\u2019 needs and expectations, reducing the inequity that may arise from differences between learning rhythms will be reinforced. Positive changes in approaching the competence-cantered learning within the school and using different teaching paradigms, attention to vulnerable students, monitoring their progress, providing informed guidance will be stimulated. The flipped classroom methodology principles better understood and more used in learning, even for young students will reinforce the confidence that school equips students with the 21th century skills and better prepared for the next stages of their learning path, equipped for lifelong learning.

Students will participate in activities that will make possible to analyze critically the impact of their own life style on the planet. Students will suggest proposals to reduce the Ecological Footprint as well. Objectives:1) To develop an innovative process starting from a problem (What is your own impact on The Earth?) and carry out a process of cooperative teaching and learning experience to achieve European Union goals in education.2) To involve  students in a real case study to analyze what kind and  what amount of natural resources are supporting their life style and also supporting the school activity. Finally, to identify and find out the impact on the planet.3) To draw up different teaching materials that will be available to schools and European education system resources.4) To enhance linguistic competence, IT competence and social competence promoting active citizenship and working in a transnational context.Methodology:The project is based in two main m ethologies to use during the two kind of activities of teaching and learning:1) Problem Based Learning (PBL) to use at every school during the designed activities (C1, C3, C5, C7) that prepare the transnational context activities.2) Active methodology based in cooperative teaching and learning to develop for students  and teachers during  short students exchanges.

Our experience has shown us how the present educative system sometimes overestimates a very rigid treatment of contents as well as scarcely  motivating methodologies. Within our european development plan, which began three years  ago, we have in mind to carry out  an up-to-date methodological approach, an internationalization process, and above all an adaptation to the new 21st century educative realities. With this project we want to link these three  objectives with the aim of making them real.International Knowledge Fair  gives us the opportunity to work following this path, in such a way that not only our centre can get the benefits  from  this educative style but other european centres can cooperate with us and they get their own benefits. The aim is to promote the exchange of good educative practices from a wide range perspective . Each school involved in the project will work  for a month period on the themes previously scheduled before hand, these themes have a flexible character to be able to adapt them to the reality of each center. All centers will work the same theme  at he same time, making use of different methodologies such as visual thinking, flipped classroom, project based learning, role plays and dramatization, collaborative work team, learning through research, gamification, augmented reality. The conclusions obtained after the teaching and learning processes will be shown and published in a written format both on  the part of the students and teachers involved. At the same time teachers will also publish an essay  including the different steps on the process , advantages and disadvantages of the methodology used. Every term a different knowledge fair will take place about the different areas of knowledge previously worked, in which  schools will exhibit and present  the works and products achieved before the rest of the schools as well as any other institution, mainly educative, that can be interested.Every member will display a stall for the exhibition with  the final product as well as the process, specially underlining the methologies used to get to those results. Apart from the fair stalls, different chats,  lectures and workshops  will take place in order to disseminate experiences among professionals and people attending the fair . We also aim at promoting the culture and diversity of the countries involved, so in the stalls we could provide visitors with information about the different countries, regions or cities as well as souvenirs...The project offers the possibility for the dissemination  of methodologies, ideas and activities once discussed and compared among paritcipants.
