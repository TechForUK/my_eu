The competition is sensed in almost all areas of the economy, particularly in the industry and subsequently in machine building sector.On the other side EU and the rest of the world are facing tremendous tragedies in fires accidents, ranging from hazardous plants fires up to tragic wildfires or forest fires.To respond to above mentioned specific threats several EU located SMEs partners from machine building sector supported by two outstanding RTDs put their efforts together to form a consortium and propose the innovative project that will create new, higher added value product that they can share in. Strategic overall objective of proposed project is to develop the prototype of the autonomous unmanned fire fighting vehicle that will be able to fight efficiently against fires in hazardous environments, particularly where men and firemen are highly jeopardized. Limitations and technical barriers of similar present product a relatively low fire exposure resistance, reduced operability in the conditions and environments of a low visibility and unreliable navigation possibilities The particular aim is to develop firefighting vehicle which will be able to enter into the heart of fires, operate and navigate reliable and recognize different objects, especially people, fight fire and remove flammable or dangerous materials. To overcome mentioned barriers and reach targeted performances, selected EU R&D organizations should help with the research and development activities in order to create the final product marketable in EU and worldwide. Novel scientific technological solution will overcome this barriers\u2019 by development of a new concept for vehicle high temperature resistance based on Intumescent, reflective materials, new thermo vision, pattern recognition system  and strapdown inertial navigation system supported by integrated GPS and IMU sensor.", 16003.0, 907458.0, "FIREROB", null, null, null, "http://www.firerob.info", null, null, "fp7_107630_999436106"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3PB", "Formaci\u00f3n Profesional en el Espacio Laboral Europeo", "Elimco UK", 20250.0, "The consortium presenting this project consists of the Regional Centre for Innovation and Training \u201cLas Acacias\u201d, hereinafter CRIF Las Acacias, which is the  coordinator, and ten officially credited Vocational Training Schools schools of the Autonomous Community of Madrid.

They will   participate  in a real productive activity  and share  the working environment. Thus, they will cover  the training needs arising from the continuous transformation of technology and processes in industries and services companies.\r\nA training course  is also to be run, with the participation of all the schools  of the consortium,  that will provide attendants  with a more theoretical learning a complement of the practical training  meant  to be implemented through the mobility. \r\n\r\nList of planned mobilities:\r\n-School name, Sector, Host countries.

The organisations will work together to devise high quality, meaningful, volunteering opportunities which will address real social needs in society and communities in the UK, benefiting volunteers and beneficiaries, and so make a better future Europe. The project will be based in a diverse range of locations across Wales, Scotland and England, including Derby, Edinburgh, Essex, Newport, Norfolk and North Lanarkshire. It will benefit socially excluded children, young people, people with learning, physical and sensory disabilities, people with mental health issues and older people\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n1 To consider the future impact of the vote for the UK to leave the EU through:\r\nExploring the impact of the UK remaining in or leaving Erasmus+\r\nEvaluating the benefits of intercultural experiences and challenging negative attitudes to non-UK nationals in the aftermath of the vote\r\n2 To develop the future of communities and individuals within them through:\r\nIndividuals undertaking positive social action\r\nIndividuals becoming active citizens\r\nPromoting social inclusion\r\nImproving future health, well-being, independence and quality of life of individuals\r\nRaising individuals\u2019 future levels of attainment and achievement and helping them achieve their full potential\r\n3 To develop future citizens of Europe through:\r\nEnabling people to gain skills, knowledge and experience, and enhance their future chances of gaining employment and accessing educational opportunities\r\nRaising awareness of different cultures and countries, and diversity\r\n4 To enable everyone involved in the project, volunteers, beneficiaries, organisations and project staff, to learn and benefit from the experience\r\n\r\nThe project will involve 15 volunteers from Italy, Austria and Germany, aged 18 to 30. The volunteers will each volunteer for approximately 12 months\r\n\r\nThe activities will include: befriending and mentoring beneficiaries, talking, listening and building relationships; providing support and companionship; supporting people to access social, leisure, sports, educational and outdoor activities to build confidence and community integration including trying new interests and accessing cinemas, shopping, swimming, bowling, eating out and attending education classes; supporting group activities such as arts and crafts groups and lunch clubs; supporting people to find their own volunteering opportunities and to volunteer at projects such as charity shops, nurseries, community caf\u00e9s, animal sanctuaries or gardening projects; supporting people to gain new skills through training in life skills, basic skills, budgeting, travel and CV writing; supporting people to access forums and services; supporting people to set up their own groups such as steering groups, newsletter groups and new media groups; assisting people to access public transport to get to opportunities, community facilities, shopping and appointments; and identifying new opportunities and interests to suggest to the beneficiaries\r\n\r\nThe project will be run through the partners working together to recruit volunteers, organise intercultural seminars to select volunteers, develop well planned volunteering opportunities, and supporting activities through a system of volunteer and project partner reviews. This will all be coordinated through our International Team\r\n\r\nIt is expected the project will benefit volunteers, partners and beneficiaries. Through a unique intercultural experience, volunteers will learn about the beneficiaries, improve competences and gain new skills, knowledge and experience, have improved personal development, be more aware of European affairs and be better prepared for work or study, preventing future youth unemployment. Receiving Organisations will benefit from the added value that volunteers will bring through cultural diversity, different perspectives, and new ideas, interests and skills, enabling them to diversify the activities they undertake with beneficiaries and communities. Sending Organisations will meet their objectives of sending volunteers to a different country to have intercultural experiences. Beneficiaries will become more socially included through taking an active part in their communities and accessing social, leisure, educational and outdoor activities. We will meet our objectives to promote volunteering in an international context, increase the cultural diversity of our volunteers, promote cultural awareness and provide opportunities for intercultural exchanges between our volunteers and our project partners, including our new Italian partner\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the project will leave a sustainable legacy to the volunteers, beneficiaries and communities, through the activities continuing after the project and being developed through other EVS projects and volunteers in the future", "http://www.volunteeringmatters.org.uk", "Volunteering Matters", "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA105-035286_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "ML4"}
