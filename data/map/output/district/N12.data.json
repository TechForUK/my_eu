But many education systems struggle to provide the language training necessary for migrants to succeed in their new communities. \r\n\r\nMany students with a migrant background are also blocked by language barrier. On average, 64% of first-generation migrant students and 41% of second generation students speak a language at home that is different from the language instruction. \r\nTeachers have a large role to play. Many recognize that handling cultural diversity in class is difficult. Large proportions of teachers in several countries feel they need more professional development in the areas of teaching in a multicultural setting. Children in migrant families are key actors in the process of integration, as they broke communication between members of the host community and their own families. While teachers are critical to migrant students\u00b4 success in schools, so are their parents. \r\n\r\nStudents are better learners when their parents are involved in their education. While migrant parents often have high aspirations for their children, they may face multiple obstacles to becoming involved in their child\u00b4s schooling, including language barriers, insufficient understanding of how schools in the host country function, and lack of time or money to invest in their child\u00b4s education. They also feel alienated and unwelcome, especially if their child has encountered discrimination or abuse. Communities and schools that host migrants need to find ways to communicate with migrant parents who may have different levels of education, language skills and understanding of the school system.\r\n\r\nAn insufficiently explored approach to overcome the difficulties to involve migrant parents in the education of their children is the Family learning pedagogical approach. Family learning is any learning that includes more than one generation of a family (including extended families and carers). The learning may be informal, through events such as family fun days, or more formal - family learning courses are delivered in settings such as schools, children's centres and community centres. Family learning is an effective way of providing adults with the skills and knowledge to support their children\u2019s education. It also provides a non-threatening route into learning for adults. The courses aim to help parents support their children's education \u2013 usually focusing on numeracy, literacy and/or language skills.  \r\n\r\nThe aim of MIFAMILY project is to strength the integration of migrant students in Schools and their success in education by providing training, coaching and guidance to migrant parents on Family Learning methods and resources to overcome language barriers and foster active involvement of migrant parents in their children's education, equipping teachers, school leaders and educators with the necessary skills and innovative tools to support migrant families in the process, strengthening collaboration between schools, families, and other external stakeholders. \r\n\r\nTo do so, 7 organizations supporting Schools and migrant families from 5 countries (France, Ireland, Romania, Spain and United Kingdom) will work together to lead the project and co-create and test innovative methods and freely accessible OER, including a Training Curriculum (IO1) an Online Platform of OER (IO2) and Guidelines and recommendations (IO3) on Family Learning for Migrants at School. \r\n\r\nTeachers, school leaders and educators from organizations working with migrants are the main target users of the project products and final beneficiaries are migrant school pupils and parents. During the life time of the project, the partnership will directly involve 78  teachers, school leaders and educators (28 partners staff / 30 experts involved / 20 target users in pilots), 100 migrant school pupils and parents (in pilots) and 475  stakeholders. A wider audience, of a minimum of 1000 recipients, will be reached at local, regional, national and European level through the planned dissemination activities.\r\n\r\nThe project will use European frameworks and instruments, like EQF Europass and SchoolEducationGateaway, to boost transparency and recognition of learning outcomes on Family Learning for Migrants at School, with the active support of a network of key associated partners and relevant stakeholders. MIFAMILY will have a direct impact on target beneficiaries, improving the skills on national languages of both migrant children and parents and strengthening School integration and success in education of migrant students, and in the target users, improving the teaching competencies of teachers and educators in Family Learning methods.

Research shows that VET fails to fully engage migrants. In addition to lower participation rates, attainment is weaker and dropout rates higher compared to those who are indigenous. AIM tackles this disadvantage head-on by building capacity within VET institutions through up-skilling staff to better meet migrant\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the thousands of EU non-nationals and international migrants living in Europe e.g. 289,000 migrated to the UK in 2016, Europe processed more than 1.3 million asylum requests in 2015. Sweden received 163,000 and more than 2.2 million Syrians now live in Turkey. The EU has made it a priority to address this challenge and the reaffirmation of the Common Basic Principles on Integration (2004/14) puts education, especially VET - at the centre of the process. However, we are still far from reaching the goal of inclusion for migrants in VET \r\n\r\nGiven this scenario, the goal of AIM is clear:  increase the number of VET institutions which go beyond procedural accessibility to achieve full, proactive inclusion, thus giving more migrants the best possible opportunity to access VET and achieve outcomes comparable with native-born students.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we will pursue the following objectives: \r\n1. Establish 5 VET Business Partnerships and Plans; one in each country to bring together 60+ key stakeholders from VET sector, social partners working with migrants and governmental bodies, to develop Partnership Plans that improve greater access and inclusion for  migrants in VET. \r\n2. Produce an innovative SELF-ASSESSMENT SYSTEM for VET institutions to evaluate their current level of access and inclusion and generate a personalized learning path\r\n3. Develop VET CURRICULUM; a multilingual curriculum, trainers\u2019 guide and learning materials aimed at staff in different roles in VET institutions to help them drive organizational change towards inclusion for migrants.\r\n4. Develop OPEN ONLINE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES; interactive online learning resources complementing the curriculum and establishing a delivery platform, providing maximum flexibility to increase access and accelerate learning. \r\n\r\nThe project methodology is highly participative at all stages. Alongside their coordination of an intellectual output, all partners will contribute to a proactive dissemination strategy, including multiplier events in each partner country and an international launch \r\n- At least 60 high-level representatives of organizations from the fields of VET and education in general, non-profit organizations working with migrants in the community, public authorities, and wider economic and social development stakeholders will develop 5 VET Business Plans.\r\n- At least 1500 staff of VET institutions, including managers, teachers and trainers, admissions, communications and support staff, will use the self-assessment tool and open educational resources.  \r\n- At least 230 representatives of stakeholder organizations will participate in multiplier events.\r\n- Approximately 10,000 individuals will engage with our outputs via direct contact with members of our partnership or directly with our digital materials, especially interactive website.\r\n\r\nAIM is a pioneering and transformative project that empowers VET institutions to achieve much greater and more sustainable levels of inclusion for migrants.  Staff will embrace diversity and inclusion on a personal and professional level as a means of staying relevant and thriving in a changing world; VET institutions will modify pedagogical approaches, incorporate transversal skills and promote student-centred learning that help close the performance gap and minimize dropouts among migrants. VET institutions will improve their reputation and recruitment as a result. Stakeholders will benefit from enhanced relationships with VET to enable knowledge and best practice sharing, a vital feedback loop to help monitor and improve services for migrants in the medium term. Overall, migrants will find more places on more suitable courses and find their education enables them to integrate more quickly into social and economic life. \r\n\r\nAIM is relevant throughout Europe, but is especially important to regions experiencing, or expecting, very high inflows of migrants, which need a swifter process of integration into the VET sector and/or where national policy change is moving faster.

In other words, migrant women are placed at the intersection of two processes, gender and racial subordination.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurship training has increasingly shown to be a useful mean of combining skills training with integration: when taught as a transversal skill, it can be a path to business creation, employment, involvement in community initiatives or simply problem solving and self-esteem. Often the fact of participating in a training course among locals has positive impacts on inclusion.  In reality, though, enterprise training providers are not well equipped to train females from different cultural backgrounds; recruitment is limited to people \u201cin the mainstream\u201d and the content and delivery can be so far from their experience that the courses are ineffective in leading to the expected outcomes.\r\n\r\nTRUE partners see this in our daily work and it causes us concern: \r\n- low rates of participation from foreign born females in enterprise training \r\n- low number of courses on enterprise in community organizations\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the objective of TRUE is to significantly improve the access to, and quality of entrepreneurship education within the context of inclusion and diversity, to unlock the potential of migrant and refugee women.

Nevertheless, migrant women face specific challenges when setting up and running a business, including access to: information and training; networks for business purposes; and financial skills (EC.2016)\r\n\r\nThe OECD define financial literacy as a combination of the awareness, knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours necessary to make sound financial decisions and ultimately achieve individual financial wellbeing. Financial literacy improves migrant women\u2019s management of their personal and household finances and empowers them to choose and access appropriate financial services and products, as well as to develop and manage entrepreneurial activities. The common barriers to migrant women improving their financial literacy fall into four broad categories: social and cultural, physical, educational and financial. \r\n\r\nFinancial literacy is complementary with other skills more related with business management, including the economical skills.

Staff will appreciate the more modern, professional environment and be more capable of work on high scale international collaborative projects.\r\n- WIDER STAKEHOLDERS from across the youth, VET and community services sectors will be exposed to new forms of inclusive entrepreneurship education and be more likely to commit to more practical strategies for improving inclusion and diversity on a wider level.\r\n- COMMUNITIES will see a rise in entrepreneurship and innovation among young people and benefit from the increased social integration and cohesion that comes from enabling young women to play a productive role in the economy and society.", "http://www.gwacic.com", "Dungannon Enterprise Centre", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA205-036919_3"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["0JE", "RAL", "Finchley Memorial Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "N12"}
