This is because SCC requires a substantial quantity of fine powder to give the concrete the necessary cohesion to achieve its flowing properties, and prevent segregation.

In the medium term, the project also aims to facilitate the integration of mobility into national training systems, and also to promote the recognition of the knowledge and skills acquired during mobility through the attribution of valid credits. In this way, the project will contribute towards lifelong learning in the truest sense of the term, by ensuring that the resulting competence and enhanced employability will serve to reduce the risk of social and professional exclusion and, on the contrary, improve awareness of active European citizenship.\r\nThe participants selected will have clearly followed a training path relevant to the achievement of these objectives, but are currently facing difficulties as far as breaking into the job market is concerned. In order to remove this obstacle the participants need to acquire some form of competitive advantage, especially given the fact that the current scenario of socio-economic crisis in Europe is leading employers to further reduce the number of employees and, at the same time, make higher demands in terms of required qualifications. As a result, young people without access to a chance to develop key skills, to gain professional experience and to prepare themselves for entry into the market, may risk long-term unemployment or find themselves obliged to accept survival work which has nothing to do with their chosen career. In either case, this inevitably leads to frustration, and sometimes even to social and professional exclusion.\r\nTransnational mobility, promoted by a high quality project, creates added value in terms of employability by means of better language skills, not just for social integration but also for professional development, and by means of a clearer understanding of the European dimension of life and work in the future. Mobility brings citizens together, increases mutual understanding and tolerance and boosts confidence to face a world of instability, uncertainty and insecurity in relation to the near future. By providing valid, transparent, clearly-certified qualification which can be easily recognised by employers, mobility also increases the participants\u2019 levels of competitiveness and employability. \r\nThis project will therefore deliver a 13-week mobility programme for 70 young Portuguese citizens who have concluded vocational training, including those from disadvantaged social backgrounds. The project will include language preparation for all participants, adapted to their real communication needs, and will provide specific socio-cultural preparation so as to help develop intercultural competence. The language preparation organised by CEL will be teacher-led and will include the use of our own materials, specifically created for this purpose. At the end of the experience, the participants will be evaluated and given a language competence certificate issued in accordance with the C.E.F.R. for Languages and stating the contexts in which skills have been acquired. Following this preparatory stage, the participants will begin a 13-week work placement experience, seamlessly connected to their existing training path, certified in accordance with national vocational training legislation and clearly indicating the skills acquired and the performance level of each participant. Finally, these several forms of certification will be linked by Europass Mobility certification, clearly indicating to potential employers the content of the work placement and the knowledge and skills acquired, and will therefore demonstrate the capacity of the participant to take initiative in the construction of his own future career.  \r\nThe mobility experiences to be carried out under the terms of this project will occur between Sep. 2015 and June 2016 and will involve 21 partners from 8 member states of the EU, chosen for their proven competence in guaranteeing excellence in mobility and for their specialised knowledge of the specific professional sectors in which the participants wish to pursue their careers. Upon conclusion of this transnational experience, the participants will therefore be able to approach the job market with an enhanced profile, a completely new perspective of their future and a greater spirit of innovation and determination.\r\nWe firmly believe that this project will make an active contribution towards the fight against unemployment by promoting more and better qualification, relevant lifelong learning and the recognition and validation of real skills acquired through formal, non-formal and informal learning.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PT01-KA102-012587_14"], ["1LY", "Boosting Employment Through European Vocational Placements", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", 145402.0, "The project stems from the university's on-going commitment to internationalise the experience of its students in line with key aspects of the university'siInternationalisation sub-strategy. The ever increasing importance of instilling a European and more widely 'globalised' identity among it's students and staff is a necessity in the evolution of our role, regionally, nationally and internationally. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to address the underlying requirements of this sub-strategy by continuing to build on the successful foundation we already have  through  broadening the aims, ambitions and horizons of our students by offering them the opportunity to realise a period of European work experience. We aim to increase our portfolio of partnership relationships whilst strengthening existing partnerships and in doing so offer such opportunities to a greater number of participants from a wider background of vocational academic fields. The outcome of these aims and objectives will be to inject international dynamism to the local and regional knowledge base that helps to underpin the local and national economy, sharing best practice in industry and driving creativity and talent forward in an ever more global economy.\r\n\r\nWe hope to offer a broad range of work placements across a variety of vocational areas to 125 students and recent graduates, particularly in the sciences, education, and engineering fields. These opportunities will mainly be long term placements for both, students looking to undertake a sandwich option abroad and final year students hoping to gain the international work experience they will require when establishing themselves in their chosen career pathway. These opportunities will be offered in collaboration with partners selected for their experience in the field of providing 'host' organisational services in the Lifelong Learning arena across five locations in Europe. Our partners will provide end-to-end services from logistical support and project monitoring and administration to certification and final reporting, but most importantly, we trust that all partners have the networks and expertise to deliver dynamic, engaging and challenging traineeship opportunities for our participants.\r\nWe follow already tried and tested methodologies implementing improvements where they can be identified.

The beautiful products of Emilian agriculture and typical gastronomy are also strengths of local promotion and tourism of the territory.The partnership is completed by schools and vocational centers of the provinces, business associations, promotion consortia, global enterprises and with a selection of the most appropriate receiving partners.\u201cEAT in Emilia 2\u201d project  arises from the knowledge of the territory, its products and the concept of promotion, but with a strong connotation in marketing, e-communication and e-commerce areas, with pragmatic references to operative tools, including ICT and social media, which allow, through the European benchmark, to develop the best possible performance to be spent on the labor market, raising the employability level of participants.The concept of \u201ctypical food product\u201d is here defined and 'transferred' certainly not from a closing or defensive point of view, but as GLOCAL RESPONSE to the increasing search for quality. This in order to pursue competitiveness and sustainability, fostering the reconfiguration of production systems and giving more negotiation power to farmers and rural groups.We want to enrich our young learners with innovative skills, to support both exploitation policies and SMEs willing to grow in value (and income), providing them with ideas and strategies to develop toward a real \u201cglocalization\u201d.

As a backdrop to the project, in recent years Europe has had to come to terms with high rates of unemployment in all age groups, but most particularly among young people and among adults with low levels of qualification. To coincide with this, the European labour market shows ever-increasing competitiveness related to specialised competence and knowledge and to the involvement of new technologies. In social terms, recent months have been characterised by a negative economic impact on inclusion and on social justice, exacerbated by the refugee crisis and the simultaneous increase in the threat of terrorism, often originating from inside the EU itself. European values and principles appear to be at a crossroads as cohesion weakens. It is within this kind of context that projects such as this one can make a difference, by contributing at grass-roots level towards an upturn in growth, based on the principles of equal opportunities and inclusion, gradually leading to a new increase in prosperity and wellbeing. This will be achieved through local and transnational co-operation and by means of the mobilities we intend to promote, which together will provide important added value to all involved and will represent another step forward in achieving these goals. At the level of the organisations involved (the members of the consortium, the intermediary and the receiving organisations), there is a valuable opportunity to become more competitive though the processes of innovation, of co-operation and of internationalisation implicit in the execution of the project, which will also include the application of several elements of the ECVET system. This will permit the full integration of these elements into the curricula of some of the courses offered by the organisations involved, and the integration of mobility into the training plans of these courses.In practical terms, the project will provide 2-month mobility experiences for 55 participants who will have completed vocational training related to sectors which reflect the training offered by the members of the consortium, with a emphasis on those from economically, financially and socially underprivileged backgrounds. The mobility opportunities will be distributed according to the needs of each organisation and will take into account the number of trainees completing courses each year. The co-ordinator, CEL, will attribute 16 mobilities to students completing vocational training in translation and interpreting, and in language teacher training, given the average total of 50 per year. The CML training department will benefit from 10 mobilities given their average annual total of 30 trainees who complete courses in gardening and paving. The Education and Development Centres at CPL will benefit from 29 mobilities distributed among 16 training areas, which include a variety of sectors, such as management, fashion design, tourism, IT, electricians, arts and audiovisuals. Every year, more than 500 trainees complete training at CPL. As a result of their mobilities, the participants will gain the knowledge, skills and competence which are fundamental to obtaining enhanced employability, both on a personal and on a professional level, in terms of both language skills and cultural awareness, and in terms of both social and civic skills. The project will also provide 12 2-week mobilities for staff (professionals working at the organisations of the consortium), in areas related to vocational education, training and integration, with a view to improving their skills so that they may better contribute towards the common strategy of international co-operation.With the aim of ensuring that these goals are achieved with high levels of quality, the project will include 29 partner organisations (intermediary and receiving organisations). The considerable quantity of PIC numbers belonging to receiving organisations demonstrates the commitment already consolidated between them and the intermediary partners, a clear indication of commitment to the aims of the project.  The project is therefore the result of co-operation between the consortium and its partners, and its design and structure reflect this co-operation in terms of the organisation and management of the project, in terms of the selection and preparation of the participants, the supervision of the mobilities, the evaluation, certification and validation of the skills acquired, and the dissemination of the results.

Also, a Personal Development Plan (Individual development plan -IDP) will be created that identifies the aspirations and objectives of the participants including an action plan to achieve them. The group of participants will have at their disposal a Coacher, a Placement Coordinator, a Company Tutor and a Mobility Manager.\r\nThere will be 3 flows, of which 2 groups for Spain with 6 participants + 1 Accompagning person and 1 for the UK - 7 Participants + 1 Accompanying person. The flows will be of 46 days, in the fields of broadcasting, media and visual sector. The mobility is preceded by a period of training in Italy. The admission requirements: to have completed secondary education, age between 18 and 29 years, inclusive, possibly to be enrolled in one of our VET courses, mainly residents in the province of Chieti or in other neighboring provinces of Abruzzo.  They should be willing and able to spend 46 days abroad and open\r\n to learn new skills. \r\nThe Accompagning Person will be present for the first week of the mobility period and together with the Placement Coordinator will monitor and check that all the learning outcomes of the participant are achieved. Each participant gets ECVET credits at the end of the placement, these can be used in other VET courses at EQF level 3. At the end of the placement the skills and competences are registered in the Regional personal assessment booklet as per D.lgs. 13/13 and the ECVET credits are registered in the Europass Mobility Certificate.\r\nWe want to create professional vloggers who are aware of their skills and professionalism and are able to enhance their work chances, reducing, thus, youth unemployment and creating new job opportunities. The foreign experience also encourages collaboration between different countries and the value of European citizenship.\r\nThe project promotes collaboration between the different agencies and also offers a period of training for the staff, with job-shadowing. The hope is to also create skilled staff who are comparable to the different European training systems and create new training programmes and projects in the future, where the inclusion of cultures, religions, socio-cultural aspects and needs of the labour market are based on the innovative training methods.\r\nThe impact on the territory is expected to be on different levels, producing benefits to the participants, their families, the place where they live and training institutions, and therefor will contribute to the understanding of the importance of life long learning and the benefits of European citizenship.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA102-005794_6"], ["4EX", "Learning hospitality in Europe by undergoing a VET traineeship", "Cafe Maxsim", 304309.0, "Over the past 20 years, the technical and vocational education has been subject to numerous reforms and changes that had weakened the training offer. Add to this the phenomenon of widespread Italic \"genericism\" that, pushing students towards a choice of extensive and generic studies, is actually the main reason of demotivation towards studies and school drop-out.\r\n\r\nThese elements move in contrast with the needs of the labor market for technical-professional and in particular in tourism and hotel sector.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the demand for labor, in conjunction with the technological development and competitiveness of the market, requires increasingly specific skills and the same employers recognize that the preparation of the staff coming out of the training course is not always adequate.\r\n\r\nTo complete the picture, it is estimated that in the near future, at the conclusion of the current economic crisis, the demand for labor will greatly increase, with particular reference to its technical and professional fields\r\n\r\nIn this context the institutes IFOM, Varalli, Bertarelli and Besta have found the common need to compensate the mismatch between training offer and the needs of enterprises, reducing the mismatch between demand and supply of labor, reduce early school leaving and improving integration between schools and business.\r\n \r\nThe realization of this general objective goes through the achievement of the following specific objectives:\r\n\r\n- For students, to strengthen their professional skills, transversal and personal, enhancing their career prospects and their motivation, creating a sense of entrepreneurship, emancipation, European and intercultural awareness;\r\n\r\n- For the staff involved, to improve their professional and linguistic skills, to understand the practices related to the world of education and its links with the world of work, to understand the social, linguistic and cultural differences, to increase the ability to address the needs of the most disadvantaged and to strengthen the capacity to sustain their motivation to work;\r\n\r\n- For the organizations involved, to learn to operate internationally, to understand how to provide the most stimulating educational activities, to create a modern and dynamic working environment, to develop activities good for the whole civil society.\r\n \r\nFor this reason, the project \"Learning in hospitality Europe by undergoing a traineeship VET\" promotes the development of internships abroad for students of the consortium schools.\r\n\r\n The project includes two activities:\r\n1) Mobility of 92 students and 16 escorts for an internship abroad lasting one month;\r\n2) Mobility of 20 neo-graduates for an internship abroad lasting 10 weeks\r\nThe activities will take place from 01.06.2017 until 31.01.2019 and includes the selection and preparation of students, the organization of the mobilities, activities abroad, evaluations, dissemination and follow-up activities.\r\nThe consortium plans to include in mobility 8 students with special needs, in detail students with DSA or BES.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed actions will be wide and will involve multiple levels of recipients in direct and indirect manner:\r\n\r\nstudents:\r\n- Competitiveness on the labor market;\r\n- Improving their social skills;\r\n- The acquisition of transversal skills (self-esteem, responsibility, ability to take tasks, ...) will also bring benefits to emancipation and employability;\r\n- Peers of the students are indirect beneficiaries, through the experiences of the participants in the action.\r\n\r\nTeachers:\r\n- The renewed interest in teaching will bring greater efficiency in learning of the students;\r\n- Sharing a common experience with the students will produce a greater understanding of their difficulties and more effective communication between teachers and students;\r\n- A better understanding of the labor market in Europe will offer more precise knowledge in supporting the education of students.\r\n\r\nSchools:\r\n- Increased ability to manage projects;\r\n- Increased understanding of the training gaps of students who are entering the world of work;\r\n- Development of ECVET as tools for the recognition and validation of students' Learning Outcomes;\r\n- Increased understanding of the tourist business processes in Europe;\r\n- Increased ability to intervene on motivation and orientation of students, particularly those with fewer opportunities;\r\n- Increased competitiveness of vocational schools, compared to other training institutions, crediting the institutions involved at the local level;\r\n- Refinement of the offer of training based on the skills and specific needs of the students, thanks to new contacts with foreign companies;\r\n- Training of students in line with market requirements;\r\n- Increased internationalization of training institutions, in line with European standards of education.\r\n\r\n During the project, the Europe Direct Regione Lombardia will disseminate the project among

Coping with diversity at schools is a matter of close cooperation and joint learning, not only within schools, but also among schools. Teacher networking in schools has been considered to be one of effective ways of professional development and increasing expertise at schools in recent years. When talking about professional networks in our project, we mean open, continuously cooperating groups of teachers within one school and across various schools sharing their experience and materials and cooperating in terms of innovations and development of teaching and learning. Many researchers as well as policy makers underline the importance of internal and external support of networks. It is therefore essential to prepare school leaders in relation to their competence to lead and manage a network of teachers. The value of the project is the opportunity to compare the situation in the individual countries (schools), to mutually exchange experience and create such an educational material that will support innovative approaches in the work of headteachers and in their efforts to manage professional learning networks. \r\nThe main objectives of the project are (1) to develop competencies of headteachers of primary and lower secondary schools for managing professional networks of teachers focused (not only) on the area of diversity management at schools and building a culture of networking at schools; (2) to develop competencies of the trainers of headteachers in the educational topic of professional networks by developing the training modules; (3) to promote a cooperation and exchange of experience among the participating headteachers and their trainers. The main target groups are headteachers and their trainers. In the second sequence, the target group also includes teachers particularly involved in the exchange of experience and improving the quality of teaching through participation in the professional networks aimed at managing diversity at schools.\r\nThe project consortium consists of six partners (CZ, SI, SE, BE, UK, ES), the Czech partner (Masaryk University) is the project coordinator. The project partners have been involved in developing and realising nationally recognized training courses/programmes for headteachers, and they cooperate with entities involved in the development of school policy. All the partner institutions have been in long-term cooperation with a high number of schools and headteachers in research and development projects, too. \r\nThe methodology of the project includes activities as following:  Website and communication platform preparation, theory  on networking review,  assessment of the head teachers/school needs and situation in involved countries \u2013  qualitative study  (interview with headteachers) and quantitative study (questionnaire),  development of Baseline Study, training modules preparation, training modules piloting,  national workshops and Handbook for headteacher trainers  development.\r\nFive headteachers in each country will co-operate on the interviews, examples of good practice, giving feedbacks etc. For the purpose of experience and good practice, the headteachers of the involved (and other) schools may use the project website (national and international sections), they may create contacts and cooperating network of headteachers/schools at the national and international level and they can continue in cooperation even after termination of the project. \r\nThe main project outputs are: Theoretical Framework (text file), a comparative study based on qualitative analysis (text file), comparative study based on quantitative analysis (text file), complete Baseline Study summarizing theoretical and empirical data, and suggestions for traning modules (printed in English and all national languages), Handbook \u2013 training modules (CD).  The quality of the outputs will be reviewed by the experienced external evaluator. The feedbacks from headteachers, national workshops and ENIRDELM conference participants will be incorporated. The outputs will be promoted through project website, national workshops, international symposia at ENIRDELM conferences, closing conference, different national media etc. The training modules and Baseline Study are going to become a part of the training courses implemented in the participating partner institutions and they are therefore going to continue to be used.

It has an expansive impact on economic growth, employment and social development. Nevertheless the tourism sector faces a series of challenges, e.g. difficulty of finding and keeping skilled staff or growing demand for customised experiences, new products and growing competition from other EU destinations.\r\nIn June 2010, the European Commission adopted the Communication, \u201cEurope, the world's No. 1 tourist destination \u2013 a new political framework for tourism in Europe\u201d. This communication set out a new strategy and action plan for EU tourism focusing on improving the range of tourism products and services as well as enhancing tourism quality, sustainability, accessibility, skills and ICT use.\r\nAccording to the European Regions Research and Innovation Networks more attention should be given to up-skilling tourism workers and a formal recognition and validation of skills at national and European levels. This holds especially true to where cross boarder mobility is high and many tourism companies experience shortage of skilled workers with a high level of staff turnover. Finding the adequate skilled professionals, in addition to keeping skilled, motivated and knowledgeable staff is key to enhance the competitiveness of companies in the industry sector. On the other hand, many VET learners state that there is a range of free resources to learn English in tourism, but these resources are mainly directed at the hotel sector with focus on the reception and restaurant. Hotels in popular touristic destinations have extended their offers to the wellness sector to offer their guests: manicures, pedicures and massages. Due to the fact that, that hotels work on a global market, the staff in the wellness sector work more and more with international clients and English is quite often used as a common language. Therefore, there is a high need to learn or refresh ones English. Employees in the wellness sector are in many cases not able to attend classes because they may have clients during the normal course times or a basic English course would not fit their needs since does not focus specifically on occupational specific language. \"Assessment and enhancement of vocational language skills in the wellness sector\" (Assess Well) aims to train and further train individuals in the wellness sector. The project consortium is made up of organisations from Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Together they plan to endeavour on a three year quest to develop a curriculum based on learning outcomes, language learning while taking into account various aspects of the wellness sector, for example: spa management, hygiene, care cosmetics, intercultural competences. The curriculum will be modular in structure and include work-based learning in regards to practical exercises like onsite workshops, job-shadowing, authentic simulations. The outcomes of this curriculum will be based off of a research (desktop and surveys) with the target group: VET schools, providers,  curriculum designers; furthering VET institutions; language teachers in VET; tourism/wellness sector employers and employees.\r\nIn correlation with the curriculum media-based language resources will be developed. About 6 \u2013 7 videos of 10 minutes maximum videos will be developed and include learning outcomes which are based on skills, knowledge and competences for the English language since this is more often than not the lingua franca for the tourism and wellness sector. The resources will include exercises to check for understanding and promote occupational specific language learning for persons who already have a beginners knowledge of English. \r\nBuilding off of the initial outcomes assessment tool for the recognition and validation of language skills and work-based activities in the tourisms sector, this output will be two-fold in that there will be a theoretical knowledge and also a testing portion which will assess learners based on their intercultural competences, ability to converse professionally with customers, ability  to follow the correct steps when performing a treatment etc. The tools will enable assessors to define levels of competences.\r\nTo validate and test the appropriateness of Assess Well, a training concept in which persons can take place in a virtual and/or physical mobility based on the curriculum and resources will be developed. The training will be tailored to the persons individual skills and a training will take place during the project\u2019s lifetime with at least 15 persons for five-days in the UK, not to exclude persons unable to travel the consortium will test a means virtual mobility. An assessment of the skills will be done before and after the mobility to demonstrate the benefits of such a training.

This has been documented by a number of respected sources, including the Aerospace Growth Partnership (a UK aerospace collaboration between government and industry) and SEMTA (the UK sector skills council for science, engineering and manufacturing technologies). This indicates how imperative it is that high quality training is produced and delivered which is both relevant to the sector needs and is also engaging to the target audiences.AEERO fulfills this need by creating an innovative online learning resource in English, Italian and Portuguese (3 key languages in the global aerospace industry). The platform will be designed to meet user needs and contain easily accessible, media rich learning materials and resources that are pertinent to the vocational skills required by engineers across the EU aerospace industry, from supply chain to preventative and breakdown maintenance.The learning outcomes and the delivery methods will be informed by the needs identified through detailed and project specific analysis of the training requirements of sectoral employers and employees.

We expect that two target groups who will particularly benefit from improved workplace communication are D/deaf/hearing-impaired (D/deaf/HI) workers, and migrant workers. \r\n\r\nThis objective has been formulated around known needs, based on existing research policy, and is strongly aligned with Erasmus+ objectives and priorities. \r\n\r\nThe European Framework Directive 89/391 on Safety and Health at Work is a milestone in improving safety and health at work, which guarantees minimum safety and health requirements throughout Europe. Employers are therefore strongly motivated to ensure their employees' H&S in the workplace, and an easy way for all employees to communicate urgent messages, particularly in high-risk situations, will help to do this. It will also reduce employer's concerns about workplace communication issues, which should encourage an increase in the employment of D/deaf/HI people, and migrants, (acting on the horizontal priority of social inclusion). Furthermore, according to the Health and Safety Executive, manufacturing and construction are the industries with the highest rates of industrial deafness cases, and so employers who do not have systems in place for D/deaf/HI employees are likely to lose more experienced workers whose hearing becomes impaired over time.

According to the European MOOC Scoreboard, 675 courses have been offered freely by European universities between March 2015 and February 2016. However, despite this impressive offering, there are few examples within the EHEA of institutions strategically deploying MOOCs to complement their own educational offer.

At the moment, this potential of MOOCs is not being fully realised, due to a lack of uniform arrangements for recognition, transferability and portability of credit, as well as due to an immature evaluation framework for assessing the quality and cost-effectiveness of the same MOOCs.In particular, MOOCs have the potential of \u201cSupporting the efforts of EU countries to integrate refugees in Europe's education systems and ensure their skills development is an urgent task in the light of the current migration crisis\u201d (EC, 2016). Refugees face legal, linguistic and financial barriers to enter Higher Education, in addition to the challenges coming from the \u2018lost time\u2019 obtaining refugee status, finding accommodation, re-establishing links with family etc. With the help of credit-bearing MOOCs, students would be able to begin introducing themselves to their studies at their own pace, without needing to enroll the institutions, knowing that this credit would be eventually recognised towards their final degree, once they were able to access Higher Education more formally. Alternatively, MOOCs could help refugees top-up specific skills and directly enter the labour market.Thus, the MOONLITE project has been designed to:-Widen and improve the HEIs teaching for registered HEI students (1st mission) -Create new educational pathways for refugees (serving society, 3rd mission) and-Build entrepreneurial and language skills among those two groupsThe MOONLITE consortium is made up of experienced actors in the field, and between them include actors with experience in:-Designing and running MOOCs-Designing solutions for MOOC recognition and assessment-Setting up quality frameworks for MOOCs-Coordinating groups of institutions producing MOOCs-Researching the contribution of MOOCs to language teachingSpecifically, the consortium aims to:-Identify opportunities and barriers in recognizing MOOC-based learning for students and refugees-Create institutional and cross-institutional scenarios to exploit MOOCs for credit-bearing HEI courses & future employability amongst students and refugees-Implement a set of scenarios in partner HEIs and amongst our partnership reaching 175 learners, refugees and registered students-Create a cost-benefit analysis tool, allowing Higher Education Institutions to calculate the impact of MOOC-provision on their triple bottom lines (financial, environmental, social)-Run an open online course targeted at MOOC providers and refugee support groups on how to design and utilize MOOCs for refugees while make learning resources available beyond course duration-Create a vision and recommendations, aimed at European policy makers and institutional leaders, for a more viable and strategic role of MOOCs in European HEIsThe project will help Europe consolidate around a more coherent approach to credentialisation of MOOC-based education.

To establish a strong link between health research and lighting design, the project partners will select the most relevant health research methods, tools, and findings in Neurology, Photobiology, Neuroendocrinology, Neurobehavioral Studies, Psychophysiology of Perception, as well as Behavioral, Cognitive and Environmental Psychology, and will introduce them into lighting design curricula by producing a dedicated cross-disciplinary course LIGHT4HEALTH.\r\n\r\nRegular consultations with lighting industry stakeholders will guide the consortium's selection of learning methods, learning objectives, assessment criteria, research methodologies, and required knowledge, skills, and competences, filling the gap between research, education and the workplace. Three innovative teaching modules comprising the course will be validated through test-runs in the format of transnational Summer Schools at partner organizations, resulting in first-hand experience and feedback data.\r\n\r\nVarious participants are considered for the pilots and beyond. Students from participating universities, enrolled in on-campus Lighting Design programmes including the released course, are direct end-users of the project outputs. Other participants who enroll on the online version of the course through the Virtual Lab or in replications across Europe will include all types of learners, educators, industry workers, and design practitioners. Four public events at national, EU, and international level will be the main activities of dissemination and communication for relevant stakeholders who are essential not only as the target audience, but also as users of the Virtual Lab, multipliers of the knowledge generated, and a source of valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nLIGHT4HEALTH's impact will be strongest at EU level, while also providing benefits to society and the economy at local, regional and national level, along with other Erasmus+ and EU activities. Through intensive cross-border and cross-disciplinary cooperation, the project will trigger processes and produce results that are likely to become self-sustaining and develop further, such as the LIGHT4HEALTH teaching community and the Virtual Lab.  The project will help to prepare graduates for the lighting industry and other employers in Europe and around the world, thus contributing to making European economies more research-driven, knowledge-based, and competitive.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048246_coordinator"], ["1LY", "New employability skills and business creation in the audiodescription and subtitling sector", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", 210764.0, "In many European countries people with visual and hearing disabilities are still excluded from cultural life as the level of accessibility is extremely low. When it comes to audiodescription and subtitling (practices which offer visually/hearing people an equal opportunity to enjoy arts under comparable circumstances), across Europe there are some good practices but generally the level of implementation of these services is very low. Audiodescription/subtitling has to become the norm, not the exception, as it is today. Unfortunately, the profession of Audiodescriber/Subtitler is still not widespread at EU level and in many countries it is not even recognized as a profession. Many professionals are working in isolation or on a voluntary basis and the possibilities to make their job sustainable over time are very limited. \r\n\r\nThe rationale of the project is that in recent years many projects have been implemented to improve the artistic competences of audiodescribers/subtitlers, but no one has focused on a concrete need of these artists: increase their sense of entrepreneurship in order to foster the creation of new and professional providers of audiodescription/subtitling services which will be sustainable over time. \r\n\r\nThe general objective of the project is thus to promote entrepreneurship and support people working on audiodescription and subtitling to start their own businesses and improve self-employment skills. \r\nThe project will focus on 2 specific objectives: \r\n1) Increase basic enterprise skills of artists/cultural operators working as audiodescribers/subtitlers,\r\n2) Develop practical tools to support artists/cultural operators to start and manage their own business.\r\n\r\nThe objectives will be reached through a set of well-defined activities which will be implemented in 24 months by 6 partners coming from 5 different EU countries:\r\n- 1 international training planned to improve key enterprise skills of people already working in the audiodescription/subtitling sector; \r\n- 1 international training to improve knowledge on how to set up and manage a business which will be successful and sustainable over time;\r\n- development of a practical handbook to concretely support people working in the audiodescription/subtitling sector in starting their own business;\r\n- development of an interactive platform to support audiodescribers/subtitlers to successfully manage their business in order to make future companies sustainable and profitable over time;\r\n- implementation of dissemination activities and 5 multiplier events (2 international and 3 local) to actively involve the participation of stakeholders. \r\n\r\nThe activities will be implemented by a well-balanced partnership composed by 2 non-profit associations (Centro Diego Fabbri and Cultural Centre Wroclaw, 2 private companies: 1 providing the audiodescription and subtitling (Audiosigno) and 1 experienced in accessibility policies and dissemination (ARGO), 1 University (University of Wolverhampton) and 1 business incubator (SASA Inkubator) experienced in delivering tailored training for young entrepreneurs.", "http://www.wlv.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA204-036688_coordinator"], ["4AP", "Creative Youthwork Network", "WOLVERHAMPTON COMMUNITY RADIO TRAINING", 97838.0, "This Strategic Partnership addresses more than one field of learning is made up of 4 European Countries (Croatia - Leader, UK, Czech Republic, Hungary) who are seeking to work together to develop and test a series of  intellectual outputs and materials than can be used to better engage and support disadvantaged young (and other) learners through the use of media and arts.Creative Youthwork Network is a cross field partnership of Youth, VET and community organisations engaging with young people and others will develop innovative education training methodologies and outputs that can better support disadvantaged groups to reconnect with learning, training in developing skills and having fun whilst addressing a multitude of issues that they face personally and professionally. Throughout Europe, youth workers strive to invent and deliver activities that will engage with the hard and hardest to reach young people. The project is inspired by the need to find engaging and attractive ways to bring young people back to education.  It is notable that young people who are neither in education, training nor employment (NEETs) have become so because of their personal history of learning (that was often neither fruitful nor enjoyable), a lack of motivation to strive for targets that appear unobtainable, and their lack of confidence in themselves. Media and art themed workshops can address each of these obstacles; providing engaging and enjoyable learning, recognising and enhancing current capabilities, developing confidence, and ultimately promoting young people to set personal targets and take action towards participating in further education and towards employment.Our rationale  and need for the Creative Youthwork Network project is common across our partner countries and more broadly across the EU, addressing high levels of unemployment particularly amongst people with deprivation and disadvantage.This project first designs and delivers a workshop that develops skills and competences in youth workers to act generically to design and facilitate educational workshops aimed at engaging and inspiring hard to reach young people, such as NEETs. Then the workshop builds the skills of youth workers to design, resource and deliver themed workshops.  The project progresses from an outline workshop programme (attached) to full content and resources Having contributed to the overall design of the workshop, each of the project partners will send youth workers to participate. The project culminates in each of the partner organisations designing a themed workshop that is relevant to their nation/region.  This will result in a bank of themed workshops made available as OER, that each of the partner organisations can offer to young people.Through this process of first developing the skills and competencies of youth workers (target group 1), the project then has built capacity to reach and impact directly onto young people (target group 2).  The delivery of such media and arts themed workshops to young people may be regional or national event, that is delivered through the national funding received by the project partners. In building a network of project partners (that has to potential to engage with a growing number of partners), the project has the potential to create a European network of  youth organisations.Hence the project is transnational as it:- develops a consistent level of skills and competencies in youth workers- values and shares musical heritages across Europe- builds a future network of youth organisations who will engage young people with the EU agenda.", "http://www.wcrfm.com/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-HR01-KA205-021805_3"], ["1LY", "Modernization of tEaching meThodologies in higher educatiOn: EU experience for jorDan and paleStinian territory", "UNIVERSITY OF WOLVERHAMPTON", 719903.0, "The project aims at modernization of Higher education methodologies with cooperation of EU experiences, by establishing well equipped center, which engage technology with teaching process and it will be used to train Professors, Lecturers, Trainers whom already exist in Partner countries and Trainees in best practices of ICT in education.
