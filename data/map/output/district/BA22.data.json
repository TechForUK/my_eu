Evaluation comments have been fully addressed; WP structure completely revised and the consortium strengthened, particularly by addition of Airbus as Technical Lead.  Aircraft data networks have increased dramatically in complexity throughout the history of powered flight. Modern networks must support many nodes with a wide range of span lengths, bandwidths and protocols. Existing systems, chiefly based on copper conductors, have evolved to support these ever-increasing demands. These networks have consequently become larger, heavier and more expensive, and this trend is set to continue. A coordinated step change to fibre optics would reduce network size, weight and cost and improve the modularity, flexibility and scalability. Moreover, fibre brings many other advantages including EMC immunity and improved security. By defining networks according to a DAL-based hierarchy, the flexibility of photonics can be harnessed within the constraints of safety certification restrictions.  Terrestrial telecoms provides a rich source of technology. However, R&D is required to adapt terrestrial photonics for aircraft networks. Cabin systems have been identified as the most immediate application area: here the need for high flexibility (driven by customisation), high bandwidth (driven by information-to-the-seat) and large node count mean that the technology and business cases for photonics are compelling.  The primary objective of DAPHNE is to enable the full exploitation of terrestrial optical networking technology in future European aircraft and systems. The project will adopt key component and network technology from commercial markets and develop and validate future aircraft networks to take European aircraft systems capability well beyond current state-of-the-art and be suitable as a platform for future development", 69958.0, 5691697.0, "DAPHNE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.avoptics.com", null, "fp7_92056_986542575"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BA22"}
