Based on prior work showing a high uptake rate and use of mHealth in HIV patient populations, EmERGE aims to demonstrate the benefits to patients and simultaneous increases in cost-effectiveness for healthcare providers by reducing face-to-face consultations, estimated at 6000 saved per year within this study alone. Patient reported outcomes will be agreed and used in the assessment and development of the system which also aims to increase adherence and enable frailty to be reported using mHealth technology.
