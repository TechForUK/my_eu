However, assessing the expected future value of the medicines when used in \u201creal world\u201d clinical practice requires additional information next to traditional (pre-authorisation) clinical trials.  Regulatory, HTA agencies and other healthcare decision makers have to make decisions on authorisation and access under conditions of uncertainty.  Currently, data packages which aim to minimise uncertainty on safety and efficacy may leave significant uncertainty in assessments of real world effectiveness of new medicines.  This results in further research commitments required post-authorisation (PASS, PAES, Reimbursement with Evidence Generation), and wide variability in access to medicines between countries. \nThe subsequent uncertainty relating to the reimbursement, and thus market implementation of new medication once approved by regulatory authorities, is negatively affecting the value of the drug development pipeline. The costly clinical developments to get to market approval, no longer seem to be a guarantee for market entry. This new risk presents a serious additional hurdle for drug developers that already face pipeline attrition. It also affects the speed and level of patient access, and therefore the extent to which patients and society might benefit from new medicines. \nIn recent years there has been considerable attention paid to the post-authorisation evaluation of treatments in real world clinical practice: study design and analytical methodology for assessing relative effectiveness; and use of registries and electronic healthcare data.  It may be possible to improve the value of information available at initial market authorisation by incorporating these techniques into pre-authorisation drug development.  HTA bodies, regulators, will become able to make better-informed decisions, and developers of new medicines will be able to direct development efforts to areas where value is most likely to be delivered to patients and health care systems, improving the efficiency of the whole medicine development chain. \nHowever, the adoption of real world / relative effectiveness objectives in a pre-authorisation development strategy has many operational, methodological, regulatory, and ethical issues and Pharmaceutical R&D organisations need more certainty as to: the impact of development choices on the regulatory review process; the value of different programmes to HTA bodies and other decision makers; the best balance of pre-launch and post-launch effectiveness research and the coordination of various post-authorisation commitments.

This transition requires adoption of novel reactor technologies, greener reactions and the increase in the use of intelligent systems in processing industries. The latter means improving processes through use of real-time information and ability to affect processes in real time. The long-term vision of COOPOL is to develop new methods and tools for modeling and control, based on real-time sensing, which will facilitate the development of a new paradigm of processes: intensive, low-impact, sustainable chemical technologies. The COOPOL consortium is focusing on one of the key areas of interest to European Chemical Industries, namely the polymer industry. Within the chemicals sector polymer production plays a significant role, with European market share of 25% and providing employment to 1.6 million people within EU27.\nMany polymer products are manufactured using batch and semi-batch reactors. In most cases the process parameters, such as temperature profile, feeds, etc follow a specific time schedule, which has been fixed after an expensive period of product and process development. This tight recipe schedule is sensitive against disturbances e.g., unexpected variation in operating conditions, variation in feed purity etc., which inevitably leads to variations in polymer structure and\u00a0to inter-batch variability and off-spec products. Furthermore, the use of empirically determined recipes with fixed-time controls does not allow intensification of the process which requires time-varying feeds and reactor temperature to run the reaction faster and hence closer to its limits,  and also to switching from a semi-batch to other reactor or process types.\nCOOPOL addresses the complex issues of real-time process control based on advanced models and on-line sensors, to develop a generic basis for widely applicable sustainable intensified processes. COOPOL will develop a new process control approach, linking molecular level information and understanding of the reaction chemistry with real-time sensing, rigorous modeling based on first principles, subsequent model reduction and non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) with economic objectives, called dynamic real-time optimisation (DRTO).

Through the analysis of current food chains in urbanised areas, the 'Food planning and innovation for sustainable metropolitan regions' (http://www.foodmetres.eu/ (FOODMETRES)) project will create and improve the sustainability of the urban food production chain. This includes not only reducing food metres or the length of food chains, but also increasing recycling and improving the efficiency of production technology.\n\nDuring the first phase of the project, the consortium established a conceptual framework, establishing links between the innovation targets, scenario development and impact assessment. At the innovation workshop in Wageningen, the project-specific concept 'system innovation' was developed, comprised of product, process, social and governance domains. Three spatial\u2013functional layers of agro-food systems, including LAS (local), MAS (metropolitan) and GAS (global) were also specified, and a set of candidate indicators reviewed.\n\nThe team has performed an assessment on MAS areas in terms of supply capacity and the land use areas of metropolitan centres. Furthermore, a Common Operational Data Protocol (CODP) was established for the case study research and a http://data.foodmetres.eu (FOODMETRES data repository) was uploaded on to a MediaFire site.\n\nTwo distinct analytical strands for the assessment of Metropolitan 'foodprint' and sustainability impacts for different chain types were also established and implemented. The first strand involves a generic qualitative benchmarking procedure for sustainability impact assessment making use of food-specific Impact Areas and a newly developed Food Chain Typology. The second strand offers a spatially explicit approach for land-use allocation to match the consumer demands at the regional level.

They provided information regarding a disease, availability of patients to enter a clinical trial, review of clinical trial protocols and the informed consent process.\n\nInterviews revealed that patient organisations are essential for providing information on opportunities for patients to get actively involved in clinical trials. The generated PATIENTPARTNER inventory formed the basis for a series of Europe-wide and regional workshops, where the two sides exchanged views on how patient organisations could become partners in clinical research. Although evidence showed that this partnership can be achieved, concerns were raised regarding the potential regional differences in patients' attitudes, interest and level of involvement in clinical research.\n\nThe PATIENTPARTNER dialogue emphasised the need for raising awareness on the importance of patient involvement in clinical research and for training clinical personnel appropriately. An overview of best practices in the involvement of patients in clinical trials was presented. To support this interaction and enable stakeholders to find the right partners, establishing a clinical research database was deemed to be essential.\n\nPATIENTPARTNER underscored the importance of using patients and patient organisations as a paradigm for improving the quality, quantity and effectiveness of clinical research. The need for making connections between patients and stakeholders was addressed through guidance material and policy recommendations.

The project also aims to enable to participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe project will provide mobilities to Spain for VET learners in the Energy Efficiency sector that will incorporate work placements hosted by partner employers that can offer both domestic and commercial energy assessment work covering a range of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies.  This will enable the project to respond to the specific aspirations of each participant by providing them with a placement that matches their learning and work experience needs.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will also provide mobilities to Italy and Spain for VET learners in the Community Development sector that will incorporate work placements with employers that undertake community development work in the destination countries but that also have a transnational dimension to their work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupporting participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market is also a key project objective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nParticipants will be VET learners who are working towards or who have recently completed vocational qualifications for the Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors. Although we offer a range of qualifications for these sectors, the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are the Certificate in Understanding Sustainable Energy Efficiency at either Level 2 or Level 3 and the Award in Community Development at Level 3.  45 participant will undertake 3-month mobilities (36 to Spain and 9 to Italy) and 12 participants will undertake 1-month mobilities (9 to Spain and 3 to Italy).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nThe main activities undertaken by participants during their mobilities will be the programme of work experience and learning facilitated by their Host Employer in either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sector.  This will vary for individual participants but participants will be matched with an appropriate Host Employer in accordance with their learning needs and professional development aims.  Participants accessing 3-month mobilities will gain experience in a range of areas whereas those accessing 1-month mobilities will focus on specific activities.  Core work experience and learning programmes will also be complemented by preparation, orientation and induction activities, ongoing language support and a programme of social and cultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nProject methodologies focus on supporting learners to develop experience-acquired skills for their vocational area and learn by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  We have worked with the project partners on previous, successful Mobility Projects and have well-established methodologies and mechanisms for supporting the training objectives and professional development aspirations of participants from the relevant target groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nThe project will also provide significant beneficial impacts for the participants in terms of labour market integration and career development.  Based on our experience of delivering successful Mobility Projects, we expect at least two thirds of participants (38 out of 57) to move into sustainable employment in their chosen field after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 20% (11 out of 57) progressing onto further training for either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nThe project will help to build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities and European projects in general and the Erasmus Plus programme in particular.  The project partners will also work to respond to relevant policies and initiatives. For example, the focus on Energy Efficiency is in line with the European Union\u2019s recently adopted targets of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% compared to 1990 levels and producing 27% of energy from renewable sources by 2030.

To that end the specific objectives of the DMCI project are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022 To support the aspirations of VET learners by providing them with work experience within employers that will develop their newly learned skills\r\n\r\n\u2022 To assist VET learners in moving into employment in the Digital Media or Creative Industries sectors, in the UK or across Europe\r\n\r\n\u2022 To enable participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn total this project will provide mobilities for 27 participants across the two sectors. The profile of the participants from the digital media sector and the creative industries sector vary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants entering the DMCI through Capacity London\u2019s Digital Media vocational qualification will be from one of two distinct groups with diverse backgrounds. The first group are young people who are taking a more traditional vocational training route, rather than entering higher education, and that have limited work experience. The second group will be those who are undertaking vocational training to update or expand their range of skills of those that are seeking a career change. Participants entering the DMCI project through Capacity London\u2019s Professional Practice for the Creative Industries will be those people with creative craft skills who want to develop their employability, professional practice and business skills. These individuals need to gain experience in the industry side of their filed in order to learn to apply their skills to generate an income. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants will undertake a mobility placement with a  dynamic host employer in another European country. Through observing people in a small and successful creative business the participants will be able to observe successful working practices and utilise these skills for their own professional benefit. This will allow them to gain much needed professional knowledge and application of their skills along with gaining greater confidence in their abilities and increased awareness of where there chosen career can take them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DMCI project will provide two different lengths of mobilities, reflecting the different needs and situations of the potential participants. Learners with limited work experience who will benefit from additional time to develop workplace and interpersonal skills will be able to access 3 months mobilities that will provide an extended period of work experience. We are aware from previous mobility projects that a 3-month duration will allow sufficient time for participants to develop and apply a wide range of skills, enabling them to feel settled in their work and to practice and become confident in the new skills they learn. Learners with more experience of in the labour market who require less time and support in developing workplace skills and professional confidence will be able to access 2-month mobilities providing experience in a vocational area specifically relevant to their professional development objectives. Furthermore, our experience of previous mobility projects indicates that these learners are typically less likely to be able to participate in longer-term mobilities due to family or financial commitments and thus the 2-month duration may be more suited to their personal situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning Outcomes for the participants will be focussed around three key themes:\r\n\r\n(1) General employability learning outcomes\r\n\r\n(2) Linguistic and cultural learning outcomes\r\n\r\n(3) Vocation specific learning outcomes (digital media or creative industries)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants will attain a number of benefits from the project, including an increase in employability skills,\r\n\r\nprofessional skills associated with their vocation, linguistic and cultural skills.", "http://www.capacitylondon.co.uk", "Capacity London", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000582_coordinator"], ["6DZ", "Elargir la Liste des Partenaires Europ\u00e9ens", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 9013.0, "This project is a continuation of our previous Leonardo project as well as a part of a development of our international school project .

We deliver a range of projects related to employment, training and the provision of work based learning opportunities. Our projects aim to address the emerging skills gaps across a variety of sectors by providing direct support to unemployed people, and facilitating work placement opportunities in Europe and the UK as well as wider strategic work to address emerging skills gaps within projected areas of economic growth. We actively pursue projects to support those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe E.M. project aims to address the labour market needs within the UK's Event Management sector.  The project will address the existing skills gaps and raise standards of training in order to meet projected levels of expansion and replacement demand within the sector. The project provides an experiential learning opportunity for participants and an international experience for young people who have not previously had the chance to travel, developing their professional and personal competences and better equipping them for entry into the labour market. \r\nREY Europe will be working with several UK based FE colleges to recruit young people who are working towards a Level 3 Event Management NVQ. These students will typically be between 17 - 19 years of age and it is very unlikely that they will have lived overseas or lived independently (away form their family home), prior to their involvement in the project. REY Europe has proven experience of working with this target group and providing a structured and supported Mobility experience. \r\n\r\nThe project is expected to run for 24 months, from January 2015 to December 2016, with 10 planned flows of participants. Each flow will recruit a cohort of 10 learners who will spend 6 weeks in their overseas placements. \r\nThe Mobility will take place in Tenerife, and learners will be hosted in the area of Arona. The learners will be placed in small groups in work placements within Tenerife. The placements are all local tourist focussed organisations whose daily activities involve arranging and delivering a variety of small to medium sized events, predominantly targeting holidaymakers and corporate events, but also includes some that are focussed towards the local community.\r\nThe work placements will provide the learners with first hand  experience of the process of organising events within a company. The events are varied and as well as understanding operational planning, event set up/breakdown, health & safety requirements etc. the learners will also gain customer service experience and develop their confidence working in a cross cultural environment. \r\n\r\nStudents will receive 2 days of face to face training in the UK prior to their departure; once abroad the learners will receive an in-country orientation by a REY Europe representative who will be based in Tenerife throughout the Mobility to ensure that there is full pastoral support available to help with any learner needs. An Accompanying Person form the partner VET colleges will also stay with the group for the first 5 days of the Mobility. \r\nPrior to the Mobility, learners will be supported to develop an individual Learning Agreement and a set of Learning Outcomes, which will be shaped by the job description that they have been given by their placement host. These will be defined within the context of the ECVET framework.  The learners will be supported in-country by a line manager within the placement, who will conduct regular review meetings with the learners to chart their progress; the line manager will verify the achievement of Learning Outcomes that have been achieved during the Mobility and will demonstrate these within a Europass Mobility certificate. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact of this mobility is that students will gain first hand work experience, intercultural experience and personal\r\ndevelopment that will strengthen their position in the labour market and their workplace readiness.  It is hoped that the students will develop personal and professional confidence, an understanding of the European labour market and a set of transferable skills that will better prepare them for employment, giving them a competitive edge when seeking employment and an international outlook. \r\nIn the short term, this will be evident through the successful completion of Learning Outcomes. We also plan to monitor and evaluate the impact of the mobility of the longer term by looking at participants future career pathways and how the mobility has supported their progression to employment. \r\nThe anticipated impact for participating organisations is that their European networks and international outlook will be developed and strengthened, so that they are able to offer similar opportunities to future students and are more engaged and connected to the European labour market.", "http://www.reyeurope.org", "REY Europe Limited", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012225_coordinator"], ["4RT", "Social Media for Business", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", 156641.0, "The basis for this project is to offer learners an opportunity to gain valuable European work experience in Spain within the field of Social Media for Business.

Central to the rationale of the project is the importance of engaging with and educating local stakeholder communities to the success of ecology and conservation focused programmes and activities.\r\n\r\nThe key objectives of the CBEC Project were to provide vocational and career development benefits for the participants, including: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Enhanced awareness and understanding of the role of community development within the ecology and conservation sector\r\n\u2022 Development of specialist knowledge and practical skills\r\n\u2022 Improved employability and workplace skills\r\n\u2022 Development of vocational, personal, intercultural and linguistic skills\r\n\u2022 Progression into employment and/or further study within the community development, ecology and conservation sectors\r\n\r\nThe project also included activities relevant to the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET), as participants were current learners who were supported in undertaking assignments during their mobility experiences that contributed towards units of the qualifications that they studied.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nParticipants were VET learners who were working towards vocational qualifications for the Community Development sector and either held a background in conservation and ecology or volunteered or worked in relevant roles. Participants were typically young people aged 19-23 who had developed some relevant experienced-acquired skills through volunteering or work experience within their local communities and wished to undertake a qualification to further develop and formally recognise these skills. 36 participants undertook 3-month mobilities to Spain.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe project was based around partnerships between DSC Regen and a group of community focused ecology and conservation organisations in Spain that acted as \u2018Host Employers\u2019, providing work experience placements for project participants.  Work placement activities enabled participants to put their skills and knowledge into practice by gaining practical, \u2018hands on\u2019 experience, engaging local communities and working on local ecology and conservation programmes.  This enabled them to develop their vocational skills in and gain work experience in order to maximise their opportunities for labour market integration and career progression.  Core work experience and learning programmes were complemented by ongoing language support and a programme of social and cultural activities.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nProject methodologies focused on supporting learners to develop experience-acquired skills for their vocational area and learn by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field.  DSC Regen Ltd has worked with the project partners on previous, successful Mobility Projects and have well-established methodologies and mechanisms for supporting the training objectives and professional development aspirations of participants from the relevant target groups.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nThe project also provided significant beneficial impacts for the participants in terms of labour market integration and career development.  Based on their experience of delivering successful Mobility Projects, DSC Regen Ltd expect at least two thirds of participants (24 out of 36) to move into sustainable employment in their chosen field after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 20% (approx. 7 out of 36) progressing onto further training for Conservation, Ecology or Community Development sectors.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project helped to build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities and European projects in general and the Erasmus Plus programme in particular. The project partners also worked to respond to relevant policies and initiatives. For example, providing training and mobility opportunities with Community Based Ecology and Conservation enabled the project to respond to the focus of the Europe for Citizens programme on encouraging citizens to become actively involved in the process of European integration.\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nOver the medium to long term, evaluation and dissemination activities offer potential to engage with VET providers and enterprises within Conservation, Ecology and Community Development sectors more widely across the EU and thus inform developments in VET provision at the local, national and European level.", "http://www.dscregen.co.uk", "DSC Regen Ltd", "erasmus_2014-2-UK01-KA102-012279_coordinator"], ["6AH", "S\u00e9minaire pour conseils de jeunesse - BBC+", "BRITISH YOUTH COUNCIL LBG", 7003.0, "National Youth Councils are supposed to represent youth on national, european and international level.

The international strategy has been implemented on three levels; firstly, 33 students (trainee educators) take part in a 3 or 20-week placement abroad through the Erasmus+ programme, secondly, 8 teachers also take part in a foreign exchange programme with a chosen partner organization. \r\nThrough the comparative study of vocational training and education systems in both their own country and other European countries, students broaden their comprehension of the diverse ways in which to best support children in their development. The mobility offered to students through this programme provides an irreplaceable addition to the theoretical course, and is integral in developing conceptual, methodological and personal competences. Comparative analysis of curricular concepts, structure and attitude towards institutional education in different European countries, along with current debates, is an essential part of this vocational training. It also plays an important role in the establishment of our future European culture, and the evolution of the German educational system as a whole.\r\nThe lecturers of the vocational college, have an avowed interest in developing the international component of the training programme. Intercultural experiences and study of \u201cbest practice\u201d, provides them with competences to teach to the highest standards possible.\r\nDuring the project, 18 students complete a 20-week practical placement abroad, as a component of their overall training programme.  To ensure a complete monitoring of their placement, the students write weekly and monthly reports, which are reviewed by their tutor. Reflection and comparison of country-specific approaches to education are a focus of these reports. 15 students complete a 3-week foreign placement, principally in neighbouring countries. As an addition to their required training placements, this residence is undertaken to broaden their understanding of \u201cother\u201d educational systems and to gain intercultural experiences. \r\nThe teaching group (8 teachers) in the vocational training college is comprised of university\u2013educated personnel and trained teachers. The aim of both the institution and the faculty is to obtain the highest level of knowledge about the education and social care systems in different European countries and meet the requirements of the training programme. Through one-week on-site visits the faculty are able to learn about different organisational structures as well as understand and assess pedagogical social work in another European country. A particular focus of discussion is the standard of vocational training, with specific reference to the role of the \u201cpractical placement\u201d. The classification of different educator training programmes with reference to the EQF is looked at from a \u201cdifferent\u201d perspective and information is shared about comparative vocational qualifications in Europe.

She co-ordinates with partner organizations, participants in the exchange programme and the administrative board. There are also various additional departments at PFH which offer support and solutions should unforeseen complex situations arise.\r\nThe responsibility for the content and development of the project is held by the group of teachers directly involved, along with the rest of the faculty. At the end of a project year, the findings are presented in an open meeting at the PFH. In such a way, additional perspectives on the exchange programme, as well as institutional and curricular developments, are openly discussed. Included in this is also feedback about individual experiences gained by students in the European profile course.\r\nThis project strives to implement innovations for the further advancement of the institution. Emphasis has been placed on the professional development of faculty and staff as well as the possibility for additional forms of cooperation with practical placement institutions, where it is generally accepted that an understanding of the current developments in European countries is particularly effective for good practice.

Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 48 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries.

During these meetings it was possible to discuss all the problems and fix up the strategies for the future.\r\nOn the basis of these internships the students should learn to cope with the problems that arise from living abroad and can realize the chances of going abroad. The employees of the different companies are forced to use English for communication.  Most of them need not  speak English at work or at home. During the internships the students have to communicate in English. So they will lose the inhibition of speaking English and get in contact with foreign people.\r\nThe first days abroad the students will be integrated into the everyday life at school. So they should become acquainted to schools abroad. After that first phase they will work for 3 to 4 weeks at different companies. During their interships the students should frequently report about their expierences and jobs. At the end of the interships the students will write summaries and will be able to have presentations at school and for the local press.\r\nIn the future the HTL Hallein will try to organize longer stays abroad for our students. They should attend schools abroad for minimum of 6 months. But untill now we have not built up the basic conditions.

The project also aims to enable to participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThe project will provide mobilities to Spain for VET learners in the Energy Efficiency sector that will incorporate work placements hosted by partner employers that can offer both domestic and commercial energy assessment work covering a range of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies. This will enable the project to respond to the specific aspirations of each participant by providing them with a placement that matches their learning and work experience needs.  \r\n\r\nThe project will also provide mobilities to Italy and Spain for VET learners in the Community Development sector that will incorporate work placements with employers that undertake community development work in the destination countries but that also have a transnational dimension to their work.  \r\n\r\nSupporting participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market is also a key project objective.\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\nParticipants will be VET learners who are working towards or who have recently completed vocational qualifications for the Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors. Although we offer a range of qualifications for these sectors, the specific courses where we propose to offer mobility opportunities to learners are the Certificate in Understanding Sustainable Energy Efficiency at either Level 2 or Level 3 and the Award in Community Development at Level 3. In total, 62 participants will undertake 3-month mobilities - 50 to Spain and 12 to Italy.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\nThe main activities undertaken by participants during their mobilities will be the programme of work experience and learning facilitated by their Host Employer in either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sector. This will vary for individual participants but participants will be matched with an appropriate Host Employer in accordance with their learning needs and professional development aims. Participants will gain experience in a range of areas and core work experience and learning programmes will also be complemented by preparation, orientation and induction activities, ongoing language support and a programme of social and cultural activities.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nProject methodologies focus on supporting learners to develop experience-acquired skills for their vocational area and learn by working alongside established professionals in their chosen field. We have worked with the project partners on previous, successful Mobility Projects and have well-established methodologies and mechanisms for supporting the training objectives and professional development aspirations of participants from the relevant target groups.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nThe project will also provide significant beneficial impacts for the participants in terms of labour market integration and career development. Based on our experience of delivering successful Mobility Projects, we expect at least two thirds of participants (42 out of 62) to move into sustainable employment in their chosen field after completing their Mobility Placement, with a further 20% (12 out of 62) progressing onto further training for either the Energy Efficiency or Community Development sectors.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\nThe project will help to build the capacity of partners to participate in transnational activities and European projects in general and the Erasmus Plus programme in particular. The project partners will also work to respond to relevant policies and initiatives. For example, the focus on Energy Efficiency is in line with the European Union\u2019s recently adopted targets of reducing greenhouse gases by 40% compared to 1990 levels and producing 27% of energy from renewable sources by 2030.  Similarly, providing Community Development training and mobility opportunities will enable the project to respond to the focus of the Europe for Citizens programme on encouraging citizens to become actively involved in the process of European integration.\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM BENEFITS\r\nOver the medium to long term, evaluation and dissemination activities offer potential to engage with VET providers and enterprises within Energy Efficiency and Community Development sectors more widely across the EU and thus inform developments in VET provision at the local, national and European level.", "http://www.dscregen.co.uk", "DSC Regen Ltd", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012918_coordinator"], ["0QH", "Studenti bez hranic VII", "Revitalise Respite Holidays", 65384.0, "The Mendelova Secondary School Nov\u00fd Ji\u010d\u00edn (MSS) is involved as a submitter, a sending organization of the project.

Their NVQ will equip them with the technical skills and theoretical knowledge that they need for a career in the sector. To enhance their qualification, and put them in the best position for gaining employment in the sector upon completion of their course, they need to gain sector specific practical work experience, increase their soft skills and develop their language competences.\r\n108 participants will be recruited over a 24 month period from 3 vocational colleges in the UK, who will work together as a consortium. Participants will travel in groups of 18 to undertake a 6 week placement in a range of relevant host companies based in Seville, Spain.\r\nThe majority of participants will not have undertaken an overseas work placement before. Therefore 6 weeks is a realistic and attainable timeframe for the group. It is sufficient time for the participants to adjust to work and life in a foreign country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve a set of individual learning objectives in a structured and supportive environment. Participants will be joined by an accompanying person from each college.\r\nDuring their placement, participants will work in kitchens completing food preparation, cooking and completion which will correspond to the mandatory units of their NVQ, covering topics such as food hygiene & safety and cooking new dishes. They will learn how to work in a fast-paced, pressurised environment and how to work effectively in a team. \r\nAt the start of the placement, project staff will support participants to agree a set of Learning Outcomes for the mobility which will reflect the course units that relate to the specific tasks that the participants will complete during their  placement. \r\nParticipants will receive pre-departure and in-country training to prepare them for the mobility and will have regular and structured supervision during the placement, to provide pastoral support and ensure they are making progress towards their Learning Outcomes and developing their personal objectives. \r\nREY Europe will form a consortium with the sending partners to design, deliver, evaluate and disseminate the project.

Individuals need to be practising their trade and continuously developing. The Creative Industries are a difficult sector within which to establish a career, as the early stages of the career are characterized by very low pay which can push people out of the sector or discourage them from entering it all together.  For both sectors the opportunity to undertake a professional placement in another EU country will support participants in establishing a career in their chosen field.  To that end the specific objectives of the DMCI project are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To support the aspirations of VET learners by providing them with work experience within employers that will develop their newly learned skills\r\n\u2022 To assist VET learners in moving into employment in the Digital Media or Creative Industries sectors, in the UK or across Europe\r\n\u2022 To enable participants to develop the linguistic and cultural skills required to access employment in other countries within the European labour market\r\n\r\nParticipants entering the DMCI through Capacity London\u2019s Digital Media vocational qualification will be from one of two distinct groups with diverse backgrounds. The first group are young people who are taking a more traditional vocational training route, rather than entering higher education, and that have limited work experience. The second group will be those who are undertaking vocational training to update or expand their range of skills of those that are seeking a career change. Participants entering the DMCI project through Capacity London\u2019s Professional Practice for the Creative Industries will be those people with creative craft skills who want to develop their employability, professional practice and business skills.

Increasing customer expectations are driving the need for improved customer service skills and a capable, confident and experienced workforce must be developed to respond to this demand. The learners will work in tourist businesses undertaking activities which will correspond to the mandatory units of their NVQ, so that they can continue to gain course credits whilst on placement.Participants will be based in a tourist businesses, in a range of customer facing roles. They will be involved in activities such as working on reception, arranging excursions and marketing tourist activities in established businesses including a tour company, 5* hotel and a museum. Through structured overseas work placements in a range of established tourist businesses, participants will gain a vital insight into international work in the sector. They will have the opportunity to develop their practical skills, increase their vocational knowledge and acquire industry specific competencies. They will be supported to develop soft skills, such as communication, team work, cultural awareness and customer service ethic. In addition to their professional and personal development, the project will offer language training to increase participants' competency in Spanish. We will work with host organisations to identify suitable Learning Outcomes that are realistic and attainable for the participants and relevant to both the host partner and the NVQ that participants are studying. \r\n\r\nWe plan to target participants who have not previously had opportunities to work or study abroad.

It is sufficient time for the participants to adjust to work and life in a foreign country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve a set of individual learning objectives in a structured and supportive environment. It also fits in to the existing timeframes of their NVQ. We will ensure that the placement is framed by a supportive pre, during and post placement structure, with group training and individual support offered in order to fully prepare participants for the placement, and to offer them a full debrief and careers guidance on how to maximise their learning on their return. \r\n\r\nWe hope that the mobility will lead to improved motivation and workplace readiness for participants.

The criteria used by the institute to select the students will be specified and communicated in advance. \r\n\r\nWe plan to organize a vocational training period in a company abroad for a period of four weeks. This period will set at the end of the second semester in \u201cpremi\u00e8re\u201d (from mid June 2016 to Mid July 2016). This is the end of the second year in the three years period of the formation. This period is suitable to develop skills in a European context.

We selected International Exchanges Centre (CEI, Centre d\u2019Echanges Internationaux) from London and Dublin, referring to Loire-Atlantique GRETA experience (Building Sector) which has developed with IEC training exchanges in companies since 2010 of Leonardo Programme 2013-2015. \r\n\r\nWe agreed with IEC that this organization would take on the training research and hosting families for the students. The IEC will follow and manage the potential difficulties during the whole mobility period. The teachers from Arago secondary school will come along with the students in order to make sure their set-up during the first days of the mobility. They will go back at the end to conduct the evaluation. The teaching team from Arago will prepare the students for the mobility through language and cultural formation, and will prepare all the exchanges with IEC.\r\n\r\nThe mobility is a new driving force for students school career. They will discover a new culture, a European identity; they will acquire different skills and complementary vocational knowledge; they will develop their independence. Their stay in a European company where they carry out their formation in a vocational sector will be validated by the EUROPASS mobility.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impacts of the project lie in the expertise acquisition in the domain of a European Programme management. This expertise will allow to make working out partnerships concrete in the framework of the next ERASMUS + Programme.\r\n\r\nWe hope \r\nin the mid-term:\r\n- a new motivation of the students with an increase of their number in the Wood Sector and a decrease of the desertion of the sector\r\n- a better success to the Baccalaur\u00e9at\r\n- more students continuing their studies after the Baccalaur\u00e9at and an openness to Europe\r\n- a better professional integration\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, the project must give rise to the same will of European mobility for the three other sectors of the Arago secondary school.

Besides the opportunity to enrich their professional knowledge and develop their language skills, these mobilities enable students to acquire knowledge, thanks to which they develop a spirit of openness, coping skills and communication that will promote their success.\r\nSimilarly, teachers in these sectors are eager to acquire a culture expanded to Eu-rope, crossing glances on issues related to common pathways, but in different social and economic context, and finally develop the acquisition of new personal and pro-fessional skills.\r\nOne of the strong points of our school plan is a commitment to openness to Europea s we have been involved since 2009.\r\nWe have a European Section in Fashion and Crafts where some technological and vocational courses are taught in English and Spanish and languages courses are fostered. The possibility of a European mobility provides an opening and a major enrichment to the success of this section.\r\nTherefore, after several years of experience of European mobility and projects, we gradually learnt to work hand in hand with our partners abroad, agencies schools and businesses and we all acquired a mutual trust in one another.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to consider various periods of mobility:\r\n\r\nFirstly, a 5 weeks mobility as work placements are now being considered as part of the curriculum - for 20 students taking a vocational baccalaur\u00e9at in October-November 2016.\r\n Teachers who will assess these periods of work placement wish to visit the companies and their students in order to better perceive the expectations of the European labor market and meet new skills and ways of working.

It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and have performed to value on-the-job learning and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and knowledge transmissions. Long term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. It is part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d to have a one-year experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory, therefore more than 1154 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.Since 2004, more than 13300 apprentices have therefore benefitted from a 3 week mobility project in European Union, with 24 countries, owing to our trusted partners.

In September 2009 we managed to officially join in the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract the 3 week mobility project abroad for all our level 4 apprentices. The enhancement of the quality of our project is owing to the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest a precise programme compatible with our apprentices\u2019 modules in France, with the specificities of the host country.

Through the project young people would learn to develop themselves as caring and compassionate citizens. They would also develop skills that would be transferable. The project was triggered by recent local responses to the migrant crisis affecting Europe but as discussions progressed, YP felt that social exclusion was an issue that was ever prevalent in their countries. They wanted to understand and develop more of an active role in reducing this. The objective of the project is to involve 60 YP in 3 countries between ages 16-30 (Poland, Spain and UK) in order to:1) Explore what YP understand by social exclusion 2) Provide them with first hand insight into how groups who are less fortunate overcome adversity3) Reduce isolation, builds community connections and increase employability skills in YP 4) Raises awareness of social issues through the use of arts and provides a voice to the voiceless 5) Encourages YP to come together and share their learning Numbers and profile of organisations:There will be a total of 60 YP (16-30yrs) involved in the youth exchange, we will aim to have an equal number of males/females, priority will be given to YP facing hardship but each group will have a mix of affluence in the group.Each organization is experienced in a) working with YP b) ensuring participation of YP and other groups in society using creative methods c) identifying and creating new volunteering opportunities for YP d) provide training and support seminars to YP that are relevant to them (helping YP identify topics/issues they think are important and how to achieve goals - eg. cv writing, job skills, tackling social problems including young unemployment etc) e) communications (how to raise awareness of societal issues facing YP and society. Activities include interactive workshops exploring topics affecting YP (employment), views of YP (on social exclusion and the role that YP can have in combatting this) and the arts (a means of raising awareness and documenting project). We will also carry out weekly volunteering activities before the exchange where YP can develop skills and contribute to their society. Each YP will be assigned a mentor who they can talk to in order to monitor growth. Each week will have an evaluation element alongside the activity to ensure the project is tailored to the interests of the YP and that we are reaching our aims/objectives. The exchange will bring young people together to share learning on the issues being faced. The methodologies used in the project are participatory and involve: workshops, visits to museums/galleries, discussions, plays and games as well as informal methods like: sharing time and space together, interacting at meals and in group dynamics, dialogue, thinking and evaluation,volunteering and photography/painting/story telling. The project has been designed to contribute to the process of non-formal learning and to the promotion of social and personal development of YP involved in the project.

This problematic situation leads directly to the most important goal of the project \u2013 improving the employability of apprentices, students in full-time vocational training as well as those who have just completed their vocational training course. We want to reach this goal by offering the target group customized high-quality learning settings abroad. To achieve this we will continue cooperating with the vocational schools, the apprentices\u2019 companies, the Chamber of Commerce as well as with the trade unions and professionals\u2019 organisations. To flank the achievement of these goals we aim to strengthen the competences of the professionals working in schools (particularly at the management level), so they can better aid the young learners to enter the European employment more successfully.An overriding objective of the project is to increase the integration of participants with a migrational background, who are young parents or who are disadvantaged learners into the work force.The following are the main activities we will offer the youths mentioned above:- internships abroad for the youths in their fields- project work abroad for the youths on topics related to participants' vocational fields A majority of the participating youths will be from the following fields: clerical occupations, media, hotel, gastronomy, carpenters/joiners.These main activities will supported by the following flanking activities offered to professionals and student teachers in vocational training centers in Berlin: - Advanced and further training abroad with the topic \u201cprofessionalizing the teacher\u2019s acting in the classroom on the European level aiming to better prepare students for the European job market\u201d.- Professional development training for school management staff regarding \u201cstudents with special needs\u201d.- Training for student teachers with the focus on \u201eLearning from the Best in Europe \u2013 enhancing methodical expertise!\u201d- Training for future school management staff: \u201cHow to successfully develop a vocational training school/institution\u201dOur GoEurope mobility network encompasses 30 different partner organizations in 10 EU countries plus Turkey. All of our partners are specialized in the professional execution of Erasmus+ (formerly Leonardo-da-Vinci)-funded learning stays for youths and professionals in the field of vocational training. The majority of our partners can tap into a network of a several hundred or even a several thousand potential internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions in their respective regions. As soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined with our local training institutions the project is actively promoted to the target group and participants are selected from the applicants. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. The most desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migrational background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions. Particularly by helping to create a functional network including the body responsible for the project and local partner organizations.Our network has been growing for ten years now and the long-term effects of our steady growth in terms of quality and numbers of participants are becoming ever more evident. By now 20 Berlin vocational training centers have already appointed an EU-Affairs Representative to manage their collaboration with us.

For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results and our intention is to continue this work in 2016-2018 so that more students are able to participate. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.

The project has been developed to respond to the growing challenge of youth unemployment in the UK, providing each participant with an opportunity to develop their personal and professional skills/competences in a real work setting which relate specifically to their Employability qualification as well as being relevant to the specific vocational qualification that they will be working towards.The project will engage young people (typically 17 - 19 years old) who are enrolled in REY Europe's Level 2 Certificate in Employability course. REY Europe deliver this course to a wide variety of students who are enrolled in various FE colleges and are also working towards a vocational qualification. The Employability course we deliver will increase the participants' ability to access and sustain employment. The Employability course is flexible in that it is relevant across all vocational areas and as such, this project will build on REY Europe's previous 5 years experience of delivering Mobility projects, to offer the Mobility opportunities to learners from an array of vocational backgrounds (which include Travel & Tourism, Hair & Beauty, Hospitality & Catering and Construction), who all share common ground in that they are also working toward Certificate in Employability. The work placement that the participants attend will enable them to obtain between 1 and 3 units of their Employability qualification and the placement (related to their vocational course) so that each participant will have their Employability Certificate learning embedded within the context of their vocational area of study.   By completing a work placement the participants will develop their practical and theoretical knowledge related to wider employability, by increasing their work experience, soft skills and developing their language competences. 180 participants will be recruited over a 24 month period, typically travel to the host country in cohorts of 20  (with two groups of 10) and 1 - 2 cohorts of participants will travel during each term of the 2016/17 and 2017/18 academic years. Each cohort of participants will complete work placements across the vocational areas of Tourism, Hair & Beauty, Hospitality and Construction, which will provide them with a setting that is suitable to achieve the selected units of their Level 2 Certificate in Employability, whilst gaining relevant experience within the context of their chosen vocational area of study.It is very unlikely that any of our participants will have completed an overseas work placement previously, so we feel that 6 weeks is a realistic time frame for each cohort to adjust both working and living in a new country, whilst gaining meaningful work experience in a structured environment where they will be supported by the host organisation staff throughout the Mobility as well as by their course tutor (Accompanying Person) in weeks 1 and 6 of the Mobility.Depending on the vocational area selected, the participants will complete a number of different tasks which are clearly linked to achieving specific Learning Outcomes within their Certificate in Employability; for example one of REY Europe's Employability students who is also working toward a vocational qualification in Travel & Tourism may work within a Tour Operator. The placements core function will be to address specific units of the Employability Certificate, but will also provide the participant with useful work experience within the context of their vocational study. For example a participant could work towards the 'Teamwork Skills' unit of the Employability Certificate, utilising ECVET to achieve the relevant Learning Outcomes to complete the course unit, and gaining work experience that is relevant to their medium term employment goals. This project then, will achieve multiple outcomes both professionally, personally, academically and within the context of each participants' linguistic development.Each participant will receive preparatory and in-country training to help them to prepare for the Mobility and they will also receive structured support from both their course tutor and line manager within the work placement, who will assist them in achieving their Learning Outcomes.

Indeed, crafts and companies are now dealing with international exchanges and facing a multinational competition. Qualifications and skills are therefore put into question. In order to contribute to this expansion, it is primordial to provide each apprentice with the possibility to be trained and to work on a European level. It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and have performed to value on-the-job learning and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and knowledge transmissions. Long term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. It is part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d to have a one-year experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 5860 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.Since 2004, almost 14100 apprentices have therefore benefitted from a 3 week mobility project in European Union, with 22 countries, owing to our trusted partners. Our experience now allows us to choose our best partners to provide our apprentices quality trainings in any of our 29 trades (industry, construction, building, baking, leather and textiles trades). For 2016-2018, we wish to send again more than 1000 apprentices in gathered mobility projects together with their class and their trade teacher (77 teachers in total), 140 apprentices for a long term (one year), 105 apprentices in a technical training for 2 weeks and 6 trainers for job-shadowing.In September 2009 we managed to officially join in the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract the 3 week mobility project abroad for all our level 4 apprentices. The enhancement of the quality of our project is owing to the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest a precise programme compatible with our apprentices\u2019 modules in France, with the specificities of the host country. This approach brings a value to our programmes in France and comforts the employers of our apprentices, worried about this mobility project abroad of their employee. The project will allow our participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills. Indeed, apprenticeship and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop its adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. Our partners involved in our projects are training organizations, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organisms in 22 countries. Mobility is more and more recognized in those countries, therefore most of the previous work placements will be renewed year after year. Years of experience with our partners allow us to organize those projects in mutual trust and prepare at best each participant for his mobility.Each candidate\u2019s mobility will be validated and recognized through a Europass, his skills and competences abroad will be validated by the European partner and the French teacher on our online platform \u201cAquisav\u201d and with the implementation of the ECVET system. With this in mind, our partners have already signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The International Service will maintain relationships with partners, prepare and coordinate the follow-up and the validation of each curriculum. They help also their training centres in France for scheduling the gathered mobility projects and they support apprentices following technical training or going abroad for one year (individual mobility).This ambitious project can\u2019t be organized without the considerable investment of each staff members involved in those actions, in order to prepare at best our participant to have a working Erasmus + experience abroad.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA102-023717_21"], ["4RT", "Digital Media, Creative Industries and TEFL 2016", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", 482223.0, "The DMCI TEFL 2016project will offer VET learners opportunities to gain valuable European work experience and knowledge within the Digital Media,  Creative Industries and Teaching English as a Foreign Language sectors.

In addition to a good educational background and language education, personality development and the promotion of social skills of our students are central. Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 41 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries. The activities of the internship are different, depending on the participating organisations and include the following work areas for example: working with people with special needs, working with disadvantaged people, employment with children, rehabilitation of homeless people or administrative activities in a social institution. The duration of stay abroad is between 4 weeks and 7 months. In general, all students of the third and fourth grade have the opportunity to apply for participation in this project. After personal interviews, feedback and agreement by the responsible person for the practical training, the students contact the participating organisation on their own. In the foreground is the self-organization of the students. If necessary they are always supported by teachers. During the internship abroad professional training and personal development are central. Students will improve their professional, social, personal and communication skills and acquire new ones. They will also establish networks for their future working lives and get to know different cultures. Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily.

Our course tutors have selected specific units of their vocational course that can be achieved within the context of the work placement, avoiding the need for classroom duplication on their return. The learning outcomes for each unit will be detailed in an individual learning agreement for each participant, which will also include guidance on how learning should be recorded and evidenced whilst the learner is on placement. The ECVET framework will be used to support this process, with all roles and responsibilities for the host organisation detailed within a memorandum of understanding. The course tutor will meet with each of the host organisations during the first week of the mobility to discuss this process and clarify roles and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe mobility will also provide an opportunity for soft skills development, and learners will be supported to set goals and reflect on their learning in this area. \r\n\r\nWe have seen positive impact on the learners that have been involved in our mobility programming to date, and we hope to build on this through this project.

Since 2009, our various LEONARDO mobility activities (Slovakia, Wales, England, Ireland and Poland) have allowed  several  groups of  our students in Catering and electro-technical courses to discover an innovative vocational training  improving their language skills and  expanding their personal experiences. Two new departments are joining the Erasmus+ project: Business and Pastry/Backery. This  Erasmus+ mobility is going to become a very powerful school project which will have a great impact on all of our  vocational departments.\r\nThe project  running team has decided to  rely on the most  qualified teachers in mobility activities from both departments to apply for a 24 month Erasmus+ project focusing  on  European citizenship , school dropout  and  youth unemployment. The choice of the participants has resulted  in  setting up a group of 184 students (boys/girls aged 16- 19 years old) who are completing year 2 and year 3 of their BTEC National Diploma  and are  attending European vocational  issue courses.\r\nTo meet our participants\u2019needs which are the enhancement and the acknowledgment of their vocational competences, our establishment relies on its international partners: a Polish hotel and catering High School since 2013 and very experienced international partners specialized in vocational training programs with whom strong links have been created during previous preparatory meetings to implement   vocational training courses and internship in local companies. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the mobility activities is to give our participants in year 2 and year 3 a different approach of the learning and the practice of their profession in order to improve and share their knowledge through cooking/service techniques and electricity / electronic applications :\r\n1. In Year 2 the participants will experience technical and theoretical training courses in an European school partner for two weeks in order to acquire different schemes of apprenticeship, to become more autonomous and to develop vocational objectives easy to reach in an unusual educational frame. They will be able to exchange their practice with their foreign counterparts in English and meet managers of local enterprises (restaurants/hotels/electricity and computing companies  )\r\n2. In year 3 the participants will be welcomed in foreign companies for four weeks in order to implement their working skills acquired in France, to adapt themselves to the requirements of their work placements and to expand a real autonomy in their apprenticeship and knowledge of a foreign language.\r\n In order to achieve the objectives of this project, the qualified teachers DNL/English use educational tools (E learning) and offer a remedial vocational teaching allowing the implementation of a specific training strategy adapted to the applicants\u2019 profile.\r\nThis preparation , prior to  the mobility period, spurs the motivated participants to be involved in their progress and to adapt themselves in a new vocational and linguistic environment.\r\nTo support this in-depth preparation, a thorough work from the project running team, in contact with the project partners and the participants\u2019 families, is done to ensure a control of logistic matters allowing a proper organization of the mobility activities from the start to the end. A timetable of the activities is elaborated and updated in order to make them run in the best possible conditions.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the outcomes of the mobility activities, the project running team   will use assessment tools to analyze and quantify the expected results in order to think about future educational, linguistic or vocational remedial courses. This assessment will be useful to improve the organization of future mobility projects.\r\nTo make our mobility project known locally and internationally, some communicative strategies will be implemented with our participants, teachers and partners to motivate other students and teachers and boost the positive outcomes : individual enhancement, vocational autonomy, cultural improvement and citizenship commitment.\r\nThis great team work will allow the fulfilment of the challenge taken up by our students: Mobility-Training, Learning differently and Heading for Europe.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036370_2"], ["6DZ", "Mon Action de Citoyen et de Travailleur en Europe I & II", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 50121.0, "The Erasmus + ACTE I & II project inaugurates the implementation of an European policy for our school and for all our students, Hispanic or Anglophones, as well as for our staff. Enhanced collaboration with our Spanish partners (schools, companies, institutions, etc.) and collaboration with an organization established in several European countries will make it possible to work within the framework of our three axes project: European citizenship, work and communication.\r\nThrough this experience of a life and a significant work in Europe, 4 weeks in a company in Spain or in the UK, we want to raise  awareness all our students to the alterity, the differences and the similarities that exist, unite and separate European countries and the universal values we share. With 45% of our students from very disadvantaged social classes we want to offer 14 students of our school (8 Spanish learners, 6 English learners) an European worker experience. In addition to a fight against isolationism and geographical immobility due to the fear of the other and the lack of economic means, we seek to better train our students, develop independence, enhance their path as a young student, reconcile them with the school and allow them to consider studies after graduating from secondary school. In order to avoid troubles and anticipate risks, we have carefully monitored their preparation: a linguistic and thematic progression in both languages is established, with the setting up of co-working sessions between teachers, and exchanges with our organizations partners before the mobility are programmed. Actions intended for the whole educational community are envisaged not to confine this project of European mobility only to the candidates going abroad, but to reach all our students. Two streams of voluntary student mobility (NVQ level 3) are planned: the 1st in March 2018 (year 2017-18), the 2nd in November 2018 (year 2018-19). We have chosen this level of study to respond to the concerns expressed by our partners regarding minors and to ensure better linguistic and technical preparation for our students who will be better able to perform complex tasks and can better benefit from this experience.\r\nWe take advantage of existing structures in our school like the Spanish European section to supervise the participants. For the English language, a personalized help group My ACTE European Mobility will be created, mixing NVQ level 2 and level 3 pupils, the 2nd stream being planned early in the school year, we have to prepare them as well as possible. They will benefit from the work done in the first year to get them involved as best as possible. This heterogeneity will be exploited as an asset: the level 3 students will become the trainers of their cadets at the time of their mobility. In addition to reassuring future candidates, this will create a team spirit and a cooperation around Europe. An hour will also be available for other teachers to assist students in their workshop preparation or in other subjects such as labor law (eco-management, environmental & health prevention) and European citizenship (history and geography). Several highlights mark our project: an anniversary calendar of Europe will organize fun and educational shows (themed meals, games / competitions); two citizen trips focused on the border issue, in the Spanish/French Basque Country and in Strasbourg-Kehl cities, with meetings with MPs; the creation of a traveling exhibition \"What is Europe for me a vocational school student?\" Intended to be distributed to the primary high schools of the urban area of Pau, and put online on the internet for all public after the year II. The students will not only follow a specific program, they will be involved from the beginning by being actors of their stay: animations, programs of cultural and professional visits, approaches with youth and tourist organizations, all mentioned in the log book.

They will also see the differences between French and foreign business practices and take note of how this experience will affect their future studies.\r\n\r\nThe perspective of working and living abroad as an intern is conducive to having students realise their ambition of achieving an education with an international dimension. This  openness is one of the core objectives of the school.\r\n\r\nEvery year, at least 14 students of year 12 benefit from a 4 weeks  internship in London or in La Coruna in Spain.

That is why we must constantly be aware of those two elements and must improve our students' skills and competences; we must make them aware of that and be their eye-openers on the professional world, thus helping them join the European job market.\r\nThe school's teachers and the managing staff wish to prepare the professional future of their high school students by understanding the requirements of the European professional skills to be acquired and by becoming soaked with the European culture. The main goal at stake is to get their students preparing the vocational high school degree ready to adapt through European discovery, autonomy and to obtain the necessary skills to have access to European or even international employment.\r\nBeing now involved in the European projects and mobilities for 8 years and being strong of such a positive experience, we have selected our partners abroad, faithfully worked with them - organizations as well as schools and companies - and woven narrow links with all of them.. That is why we plan to ask for two types of mobilities.\r\n\r\n- Mobilities for placements in companies for 20 final year students- as 5-week placements are included in their course- in October-November 2017. \r\nThe teachers who will grade those mobilities will visit their students abroad, see how companies work and analyze what their needs are. \r\nThey will also meet the partner organisations , the partner schools as well as the mentors within the companies in order to put together their needs and agree on the assessment of the learning skills.

This ambitious project is supported by the ministry of Education as well as the local school authorities. It aims to create mixed classroom made of both secondary school students and adults and to enrich the academic and career pathways of both students and teachers. The project also aims to introduce and to sustain a European dimension into these fields of training which lack recognition. Our goal is to send abroad 136 youngsters aged from 16 to 20 and who are preparing one of the following French degrees in the fields of textile, fashion, leather or design: \u201cbaccalaur\u00e9at professionnel, brevet de technician, formation compl\u00e9mentaire poste bac\u201d (1-year training period). Our second goal is to send 10 adults who are being trained in one of the schools that is a member of the campus. The ultimate goal of this professional training period abroad is to allow our students to have a European dimension to their professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in order to find work or continue their studies more easily. A professional training period abroad could also stimulate and motivate our students and help to fight against dropping out and bad results. We also wish to organize a period of mobility for 21 of our staff members in a professional training center and technological platform in another European country. This period could be very beneficial as it would allow us to discover new training techniques, new teaching methods to apply to mixed groups made of both adults and youngsters, and to organize an exchange with a European partner. Welcoming our partners in France would complete the experience and allow for innovation on both sides and allow 18 staff members from our European partner to take part in an individual mobility period in one of the structures of the host organization, the campus. This will allow both us and our partners to observe new methods, to exchange, to make the transfer of new methods possible. \r\nThe objectives are a part of the recommendations noted in the European reference documentation. The desire and the decision to propose these mobility periods in Europe corresponds to the specific needs of the actors of this professional field and to the aspirations of those being trained who wish to gain more skills and to find a job where such skills are needed. It also corresponds to the needs of our staff members who wish to exchange and innovate their own methods in order to make their students succeed and to open up new training periods with new subjects of study that correspond to the European job market.  \r\nWorking as a group has allowed us to find partners to welcome us in five different countries. Mutualizing these resources has been a key aspect to our mobility project. Il allows our schools to network abroad more efficiently, to stimulate the implication of French companies in the mobility project, to obtain better visibility of our schools and training facilities on a European level and to allow our students to continue their studies once they have completed their secondary school diploma. \r\nThis project is coherent with the local school board\u2019s policy to develop mobility periods abroad in this field of study. It is the result of wanting to work together to reinforce skills and methods of those who will take part in a mobility period and to allow the campus to be the initiator of the project. Mutualizing such means has allowed us to be much more dynamic in our approach to international mobility. \r\nThe content of this program has been defined and worked on with all of the secondary schools which have committed to respecting the different phases of the project: informing future participants, selecting them, preparing them to go abroad, evaluating the mobility period and diffusing contact lists. Thanks to the group work on the program content, the first documents such as an evaluation grid have been created. The group jointly decided on how to schedule the different phases of the program such as the preparation, the carrying out and the evaluation phases.

During the period from 2015-2020 we are working towards targets of increasing our learner job outcome rate from 62% to 70% and maintaining the proportion of learners progressing to further training at 18%, thus achieving an overall positive progression rate of 88% by 2020.\r\n\r\nKey elements of this work will include incorporating international perspectives within the vocational courses and learner support functions linked to mobility activities, including introducing European dimensions to curricula and facilitating international level employability and jobsearch support. This work is ongoing and will be reflected in this project via the inclusion of a new \u2018European Community Development\u2019 units within our Level 3 Award in Community Development, as well as the introduction of international vacancy bulletins and supported jobsearch services focusing on the community development and energy efficiency sectors in Spain, Italy and France. We are also planning to utilise a similar approach to introduce European dimensions to the curriculum of our Level 3 Certificate in Domestic Energy assessment and expect to introduce this new content during the project lifetime. This approach is specifically designed to equip our learners with the knowledge and skills they need to work in other EU countries.\r\n\r\nWe are also working to engage a greater number and range of employers to reflect the needs and aspirations of our learners, with a specific focus on working with larger employers.

Accompanying Persons will provide pastoral care functions and will be qualified IAG workers fluent in Spanish, French or Italian (depending on the destination of the groups they support). Prior to and during mobilities they will liaise with the participants and their support agencies to identify any additional needs arising as a result of the undertaking the mobility, e.g. anxiety about living away from home or practical issues such as accommodation and housing support functions. Thus they will be able to support participants with difficult situations, for example lost passport, medical issues, etc, and liaise with local services and translate where necessary.\r\n\r\nAccompanying Persons will also ensure lines of communication between participants, DSC Regen and Host Employers remain open throughout the mobilities and also provide aftercare to ensure reintegration with support functions on return to the UK.

The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.revitalise.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_1"], ["5PH", "Erasmus+ - Experiences all over Europe", "Rosmary Works Early Years Centre", 58860.0, "We, the college for Occupations in the Service Industries Specialising in Social Management, are a Catholic private school of Caritas of the Diocese of Graz-Seckau.

In addition to a good educational background and language education, personality development and the promotion of social skills of our students are central. Important parts of our education are the various practical trainings. In these practical trainings our students get to know different areas of social work and also acquire social skills. Our students take the A-level exam and acquire practical, social and economic education. The objective of the project is the possibility to support 32 students to do their internship abroad. By participating in this mobility project, the students will expand their own abilities and skills, and hopefully gain financial support. At the time of the participation in this project our students already have at least 200 hours of practical work experience in an Austrian social institution and so they already have a good level of training. This allows the students to broaden their professional and personal horizons and to strengthen their language skills for working life. They also get to know a variety of innovative concepts and methods of social work in other European countries. The activities of the internship are different, depending on the participating organisations and include the following work areas for example: working with people with special needs, working with disadvantaged people, employment with children, rehabilitation of homeless people or administrative activities in a social institution. The duration of stay abroad is between 4 and 9 weeks. In general, all students of the third and fourth grade have the opportunity to apply for participation in this project. After personal interviews, feedback and agreement by the responsible person for the practical training, the students contact the participating organisation on their own. In the foreground is the self-organization of the students. If necessary they are always supported by teachers. During the internship abroad professional training and personal development are central. Students will improve their professional, social, personal and communication skills and acquire new ones. They will also establish networks for their future working lives and get to know different cultures. Through the internships our students will gain new experiences and impressions which they can use in Austria. They gain self-confidence and can deal with language barriers easily.

This organ will meet regularly to anticipate the problems on the ground, find solutions, meet the partners, and organize the logistic and, at the end, disseminate the actions, identify the impacts, and then assess the projects in its entirety.\r\nThe expected results are evaluated in 3 dimensions: \r\nFor the students : \r\n- Discovery of cultural diversity,\r\n- Struggle against school dropout,\r\n- Development of the cultural openness in a professional framework,\r\n- Improvement of the language skills during a traineeship,\r\n- Help to social inclusion.\r\nFor the teachers : \r\n- Investment to implement innovating teachings,\r\n- DNL certification, hard to obtain,\r\n- Fight against the absenteeism in their classroom,\r\n- Insertion in a new project methodology,\r\n- Closer collaboration with the mobility actors,\r\n- Motivation to train themselves in Europe.\r\nFor the High School : \r\n- Promotion of a new learning method for students with difficulties, frequently coming from lower socio-economic classes, which will help the school dropout,\r\n- Implementation of a real intern synergy, amplified by the mobilities organization,\r\n- Creation of an internal project\u2019s dynamic,\r\n- Innovation in the field of educational methods and in the curricula for a better professional integration of our students.\r\nAnother element deserves to be underlined, a strong network of professional partners abroad, welcoming our students in their hotels, restaurants or trade companies, which are growing increasingly rich professionally, culturally and humanly.\r\nOur prime concern is also to maintain the European cohesion by a deep conviction that a successful professional insertion for the youth must pass through the mobility in Europe.\r\nThis project will contribute to give an European dimension to our high school, but also to all our European partners in Spain, Latvia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Kazakhstan.\r\nIn a long-term view, the project will benefit to young people from all the participating structures, in this way it will have a multiplier effect.\r\nFor the long-term potential benefits, we\u2019ll bring to the fore a better adaptability to a professional environment always changing and an openness to the world from a personal perspective for the learner.\r\nThe ongoing assessment of our project is an additional advantage to improve the quality over the years.\r\nFrom one year to another our project methodology is improving.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046656_7"], ["6DZ", "Erasmus Episode 1: L'\u00e9veil de la vocation", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 29773.0, "Saint Malo is, by its history, a place of departure for explorers.

The project will have a schedule of 18 months and will cover two periods of mobility.\r\nGeneral objectives of the project: professional, cultural and personal training. These objectives concern teachers, staff and students.\r\nThe contribution of experience in these countries in the areas of reception of the trade or the sale will allow the students to favor their professional orientation and to know a labor market different from France. Europeans, because of the complexity of the labor market and the policies implemented in the three chosen countries, often have the habit of exercising several professional activities which change the ratio of men to work. Our students will be able to discover how the employees of companies carry out their professional activity. This project will also allow them to meet a demand that is significantly different from that of France: consumer habits are in fact more centered around the service given than the product itself. Participants will have studied  the profide of the client\u00e8le in order to understand the world of work in these regions of Europe with the greatest possible relevance.\r\nUpon their return and in order to complete their complementary training in companies, students will then be able to offer their next french supervisors the opportunity to experiment with the work methods they will have learned in mobility. Mobility should allow our trainees and teachers collaborate and integrate with the objectives of a work team, to communicate and dominate their oral expression, to adopt behaviors and attitudes that are in keeping with the diversity of relational contexts, particularly in terms of dress, the courtesy so dear to these Europeans. From a human point of view, mobility will help participants to manage time, perceive time constraints for themselves and their customers, anticipate hazards, perceive their limits, manage the stress inherent in workload and the language barrier and finally to show initiative within the limits of autonomy, curiosity, perseverance, involvement and motivation.Our trainees are already young adults through their previous  training periods in companies. On the spot, in a more autonomous way, they will learn to solve real situations with their own means: Dialogue in English or Spanish to make themselves understood and to be an active collaborator of the company; have exchanges with strangers (clients, training masters, foster parents; responding to professional situations;Directions in large cities include instructions.\r\nFinally, from a cultural point of view, the students will discover the locations of the films that took place in Dublin, Warsaw and the Albacete region: Games of track will be organized to discover these places. They will take pictures by staging themselves. These photos will be the subject of an exhibition that will showcase the project as a result of mobility.\r\nIn the long term, it is expected that 100% of the students in our school will have access to a 4-week internship abroad for the 22 weeks required by the curriculum.

We were able to measure, through a survey on a sample of Alumni European section students, the major benefits of such an experience. Indeed, ALL of them testified of the key role played by their mobility in their studies, their recruitment or employment.\r\nOur project has existed for 16 years and has continuously evolved in number and quality. We started with one destination, we now have three and soon to be four, (London, Dundee, Stoke on Trent and Malta). We went from a few students to almost a full class, thanks to the increasing involvement of our team and our partners  as well as the financial support of the Regional Council and the European Council. This expansion contributes to building a better reputation of our institution and of our area in terms of long education and employability of  the young people graduating from our school.\r\nOur partner companies are English-speaking, and mostly located in the UK. These companies are all the main asset of our project thanks to the full commitment of their teams. Indeed, our partnership is perennial and renewed every year which often allows us to encounter new potential partners wishing to take part within the project. Thus, thanks to the manager of the Michelin factory in Dundee, and after three  very positive experiences, we were able to find four other work placements for our students in Dundee this year.   We have been put in contact with the local Chamber of Commerce and also with Michelin, Stoke on Trent. It is also thanks to the Michelin factory director that we found host families approved by the University of Dundee. They host our students, making them feel at home, while allowing them to discover the cultural and civilizational dimension of Scotland.\r\nThat's also how we have met our partner school BRAEVIEW ACADEMY in Dundee.  That school is very similar to ours on many levels, same size, same students' profiles and same socio-professional category population. This year, we had our first physical exchange of students and teachers.\r\nIn London, the companies with whom we work - for some of them, since 2001 - have become active partners in our mobility project. The great confidence that has developed between the two parties since the beginning of our collaboration provides us very individualized and closely monitored training for our students, allowing us to find the best candidates for each company according to their professional and personal profiles. In London, the CEI is in charge of finding host families for our students, since we deeply believe that immersion is a major linguistic, cultural and civilizational asset. Again, the professionalism of this structure allows us to leave our youth with confidence, since in case of problems or emergency, the CEI is responsible for placing the young in another family (situation encountered only once in eight years).\r\nIn Malta, our experience is more recent. We called on an intermediary organization, Paragon Europe, which helped us find internships and accommodations. We have had only two experiments, which have given us entire satisfaction. We have also forged permanent links with Clive CORDINA and his team who have now moved their offices and set up a new company in Valletta. This company is called ZEAL. It was with this team that we tackled the needs of our students who would like to train abroad without being part of the European class.\r\nThanks to these mobilities, each year we see the benefit of these experiences being reflected in the percentage of success of the students concerned in the examinations as well as in the number of students going to college  (BTS, IUT, university ) but also in a better employability and quality employment opportunities of our students, enabling them to become genuine European citizens and actors.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046758_1"], ["6DZ", "La mobilit\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne pour tous !", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 9901.0, "Who is concerned ? the 12 students taking part in the European project.\r\nWhen students are on their last year, Charles Baudelaire Secondary School - which is located in Fosses in the Gonesse area (95) - gives twelve Business and administrative students the opportunity to go on a training period in London. The group of students is made up of 12 teenagers, all living in or near Fosses. \r\nThese young men and women are highly motivated to get a foreign experience, to broaden their horizons and experience the Anglosaxon culture. Thus we want them to be part of a European project so as to be efficient on the labour market. Thanks to this project, they can become autonomous, open-minded and learn how to adapt to different working conditions. These qualities are really important for future Salesmen/Saleswomen, future Receptionists and future administrative workers.\r\n\r\nWhat does this project involve ?\r\nIt is a four-week internship under agreement. Our students will be in host families and they will be followed through twice by our School and the Service Provider.\r\n\r\nWhere will it happen ?\r\nIn London - a European cosmopolitan city, an influential economic power, steeped in history, with many well-known monuments and museums. \r\n\r\nWhen will it happen?

It seems very important to us to impart knowledge through a work experience in a European country.\r\n3/ We do our utmost to help our students find their bearings in a foreign environment, so they can fulfill themselves and have a rewarding experience. Through the training periods, they will develop new skills and qualities, in order to get better job prospects for future employers.\r\n\r\nThe Assessment:\r\n1/ Assessing the training period and the students'progress  for the BTEC National Diploma, using a proper examination grid. The results will appear on the students' school reports.\r\n2/ Assessing the students' interest in their foreign experience,  asking them to complete a grid before and after their internship.\r\n3/ Assessing the quality of the services provided by CEI London.\r\n4/ Assessing the success of the project, creating a logbook.\r\n5/ Using indicators such as an assessment grid, a logbook, the success rate, the rate of students going on a Higher National Diploma course and the progress made by the students in English.\r\n6/ Asking employers to make a final report on the students' work on placement in order to help teachers to adapt their teaching to the English tutors' expectations.\r\n\r\nHow to enhance the project:\r\n- A Europass ceremony.\r\n- An experience shared on the School Open Day, in the surrounding schools and on the school website.\r\n\r\nThe environment:\r\n- A united and mobilized school staff - the Head, the teaching staff, the students involved as well as their families.\r\n- The European Ressource Center and Mrs Moquin (for her pieces of advice).\r\n- The businesses we work with and our Service Provider \"CEI London \".\r\n- The European Commission giving us the scholarships which enable our students to get a European experience.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-046830_1"], ["9JP", "BDC European Work Experience Project", "REY Europe Limited", 999963.0, "This project will build on Barking & Dagenham College's (BDC) existing KA1 projects that have continued to increase in terms of the  breadth of vocational areas as well as the volume of international placements that we can offer our learners.\r\n\r\nThe project will offer 434 BDC learners with a work placement lasting between 2 - 3 weeks, during the 2018/19 and 2019/20 academic years.

Placements will be 3-6 weeks long, with the exact length of stay determined by the lead tutor for each vocational area. We feel this is sufficient time for students to adjust to work and life in another country, meaningfully gain from the experience and achieve tangible learning outcomes. The destination for each student will be determined by their vocational area and the placements available. Students will be selected from the following departments: Business, Beauty, Travel & Tourism, Sport (Football), Catering and Computing. \r\n\r\nOur project objectives are \r\n- to provide European work placement opportunities to students across a range of vocational sectors\r\n- to build on the success of our 2016 mobility project, develop our internal project delivery capacity, and expand our work to offer more students international opportunities\r\n- to enable students to apply the theoretical learning acquired on their course in a structured and sector specific work setting \r\n- to enable students to develop soft skills & professional competences \r\n- to show them different perspectives & practices in a work setting. To promote cross-cultural working and ultimately, broaden their horizons \r\n\r\nWe aim to make our students highly employable and enterprising by developing the skills employers want. The project will enhance our students' learning experience and increase their employability. \r\n\r\nThe placements are framed by a supportive pre, during & post placement structure, with group training and individual support offered in order to fully prepare students for the placement, and provide a debrief and careers guidance on how to maximize their learning on their return.\r\n\r\nThe models of support that we offer our learners will be tailored to their individual needs, recognising that support needs will differ between participants and at different points in the project. Each group will be joined by an accompanying staff member from the College and will have a designated placement supervisor, as well as local partner support. \r\n\r\nThe participants for this mobility will all be students at Bath College, studying  up to Level 3 in one of the following vocational areas: Beauty (Level 3), Business (Level 3), Catering (Level 2), Computing (Level 3), Football (Level 3) Travel & Tourism (Level 3).\r\n\r\nOur tutors have strong existing relationships with learners and a good working knowledge of how best to engage and retain them, and design a project that is responsive to their needs. \r\n\r\nLearner needs are: \r\n\r\n- To gain sector specific practical work experience and apply the technical skills and theoretical knowledge they have acquired through their course in a practical setting\r\n- To develop their soft skills (such as self assurance, adaptability, communication) and their language competences\r\n- To provide participants with international experience, pushing them out of their comfort zone in a supportive environment\r\n\r\nUltimately we hope this will put them in a stronger position to gain employment in the sector on completion of their course. In order to have a competitive edge in the labour market, we know that students need to develop personal competences such as team work, confidence and adaptability. We hope the mobility will increase their aspirations for a career in the sector.\r\n\r\nLearners will develop the confidence to interact in a foreign language setting, an understanding of the sector at European level & insight in to how organisations operate in a different cultural context. In the long term, we hope the mobility will contribute to positive onward progression and raised aspirations amongst our learners. The mobility provides a structured employment experience, with a line manager and a clear set of tasks and guidance, support learners to engage in a 'real' work setting and develop realistic expectations of the working world. \r\n\r\nThe mobility placement will be explicitly linked to learners' course of study.

When it comes to guidelines, they will vary from methods or manners of teaching to needs of participants resulting from different experience in the area of working with adults, esp. young children parents. It will deal with both contemporary art and problems it suggests. The course takes place in July 2018 and lasts for a week. The syllabus includes: storytelling in practice, generating appealing stories in exhibition space of e.g. National Gallery or Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Some storytelling takes place in Cubitt Gallery. It is our partner in the second step of mobility.\r\nThe second phase is planned in a form of job shadowing of different educator pairs of Centre for Contemporary Art. It takes place between August \u2013 October, 2018. During it, educators use their better-developed skills of storytelling in practice. They also observe methods of Cubitt Gallery staff in London supporting them. The result of mobility is close insight and evaluation  of educator job profile in Poland nowadays.\r\nThe association of artists-educators and curators working locally and socially in Cubitt Gallery in London is a collective of artists who also work as social workers. Thanks to cultural and art education methods, their aim is to develop audience and to equal their chances through art. Although their activities are mainly artistic, yet combine social matters as well. In this case, the knowledge meets the experience of an artist, educator and social worker all-in-one person which is particularly important for the staff of Centre for Contemporary Art during the second phase. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that such a model is quite rare but also necessary in Poland. The aim of this phase is to introduce such a model in Jazd\u00f3w, in Poland, simply adjusting it to local needs of single parents of young children in Poland.\r\nThird step will be the result of two previous ones. It takes place from January to April in 2019. The aim is to use new skills of storytelling while cooperating with a group of young children single parents. There are several activities for them: workshops, meetings, touring, mini-performances, educational concerts both in an art gallery and in social care houses (single mother houses, community centres). The most crucial element of this phase is participation, making adults proactive and creative, telling their own stories and developing their language and communication skills which are so indispensable to development of an adult.", "http://www.cubittartists.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-PL01-KA104-049538_1"], ["6DZ", "European Mobility project for apprentices and young professionnals - Tour de France", "CENTRE D'ECHANGES INTERNATIONAUX LIMITED", 1545713.0, "The European Union is constantly moving forwards and the skills development of our European workers has become essential. Companies are now dealing with international exchanges and facing multinational competition. Qualifications and skills are therefore put into question. In order to contribute to this expansion, it is primordial to provide each apprentice with the possibility to be trained and to work on a European level. It is our duty to offer our learners such a training. Les Compagnons du Devoir have always given priority to a long life learning and make every effort to value on-the-job training and mobility, mainly through shared experiences, human relations and the sharing of knowledge. \r\n\r\nLong term mobility projects (1 year) have always existed in our association. Part of our \u201cTour de France\u201d syllabus gives the opportunity for our journeymen and journeywomen to have a one-year work experience abroad. Since 2011, it has become compulsory and more than 6700 of our young professionals have benefitted from such an experience.\r\n\r\nWe have also had the opportunity to allow, since 2004, almost 16100 apprentices to benefit from a 3 week mobility project within the European Union, combining all trade sectors (industry, construction, baking, leather and textiles trades). \r\n\r\nIn order to institutionalize our actions, we manage to officially integrate the 3 week mobility project in to the learning annex of the apprenticeship contract for all our level 4 apprentices since 2009. \r\n\r\nFor 2018-2020, we would like to maintain this momentum and keep the objectives shared under our strategic development plan by sending again more than 1000 apprentices on group mobility projects together with their VET trainer (110 groups in total), 180 post-apprentices for a long term mobility (one year), 108 apprentices for 3-months to 9-months individual mobility \u2013sharing time between a company and a VET center in the host country, 60 post-apprentices on 2-week technical training courses and manage two different job-shadowing.\r\n\r\nTo carry out these actions Les Compagnons du Devoir are continually aiming to improve and since 2016 we have put in place our own quality management processes developed through the ISO 9001 certification. \r\n\r\nThe quality of our mobility projects relies greatly on the developed teaching skills of our partners, who suggest precise programs compatible with the apprentices\u2019 syllabus in France and with the specificities of the host country. This approach guarantees the relevance of our programs and reassures the employers of our apprentices, who could be concerned about the benefit of a mobility outside France.\r\nThese projects will allow the participants to acquire language, intercultural and cross-disciplinary skills as apprenticeships and trades are different from one country to another. Travelling is also a way to develop adaptability and flexibility, two qualities required in the labor market. \r\n\r\nOur partners involved in these projects are VET centers, companies, social partners, consular chambers and intermediate organizations in over 20 countries. Mobility is more and more recognized in these countries, therefore most work placements will be renewed year after year. \r\nYears of experience with our partners allows us to organize our projects with mutual trust and better prepare each participant for their mobility.\r\n\r\nEach participant\u2019s skills and competences gained abroad will be validated by the European partner and the French VET trainer on our online training platform \u201cAquisav\u201d. We also would like to use ECVET system. With this in mind, our partners have already signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). \r\n\r\nAs part of this project our International Department will maintain relationships with partners, prepare and coordinate the monitoring and the validation of each project. They will also help their VET centers, in France, with the practical organization of the mobility projects for apprentices (short-term and long-term) and support post-apprentices following technical training or going abroad for one year (individual mobility).\r\n\r\nThis ambitious project couldn\u2019t be organized without the considerable investment of VET centers, in particular our VET trainers and administrative teams.", "http://www.cei-work-travel-study.com/", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA116-046192_16"], ["9JP", "Erasmus Pro Mobilities for the Energy and Community Sectors", "DSC Regen Ltd", 805165.0, "INTERNATIONALISATION STRATEGY\r\nThe overall aim of our Internationalisation Strategy is to achieve enhanced outcomes for our learners by increasing the scale and scope and enhancing the quality of our mobility activities. From 2015-2020 we are working towards increasing our learner job outcome rate from 62% to 70% and maintaining the proportion of learners progressing to further training at 18%, thus achieving an overall positive progression rate of 88% by 2020.\r\n\r\nKey elements of this work will include incorporating international perspectives within the VET courses and learner support functions linked to mobilities, including introducing European dimensions to curricula and facilitating international level employability support. This is reflected in this project via the inclusion of a new qualification \u2013 the Level 3 Award in European Community Development, which was developed as part of our recently completed 2016 KA2 project ECVET for Community Development.  The full qualification specification can be accessed at: https://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Detail/Index/38001?category=qualifications&query=LRN%20Level%203%20Award%20in%20European%20Community%20Development \r\n\r\nWe are also planning to utilise a similar approach to introduce European dimensions to the curriculum of our Level 3 Certificate in Domestic Energy Assessment and expect to introduce this new content during the project lifetime.\r\n\r\nThis approach will equip our learners with the knowledge and skills they need to work in other EU countries and we will complement this by introducing international vacancy bulletins and supported jobsearch services focusing on the community development and energy efficiency sectors in Spain, Italy and France.\r\n\r\n2018 objectives within our VET Mobility Charter Internationalisation Strategy included:\r\n\u2022 Introducing new mobility types linked to qualifications accredited by the Institute of Environmental Management Assessment (IEMA)\r\n\u2022 Increasing the total number of mobilities offered to 117\r\n\r\nAs envisaged in our Internationalisation Strategy, we have created new mobilities linked to the following IEMA Level 4 qualifications:\r\n\u2022 Carbon Footprinting, Accounting & Management\r\n\u2022 Environmental Management Systems Implementation\r\n\u2022 Lead Environmental Auditor\r\n\u2022 Working with Environmental Sustainabilty\r\n\r\nThese qualifications reflect the overall focus on environmental sustainability within our KA1 projects, as well as the professional development aspiration of our learners and, crucially, are highly relevant to the work of many of our Host Employer partners.\r\n\r\nWe are also working to respond to the needs and aspirations of our learners by engaging a greater number and range of employers. This is reflected in the inclusion of a total of 29 Host Employers as partners in this project, of which 7 are larger employers - Isotrol, Revergy, CSIC, CODA, Cooperacion Internacional and Emergya Ingenieria (please note that for national organisations, employee and learner numbers relate to the local office/branch). We have also continued to develop the 6-month mobilities incorporated within our 2016 and 2017 KA1 projects and targeted at learners specifically looking to gain employment in a role with an international dimension, increasing the number offered within this project to 16. However, we will deliver a total of 100 mobilities within this project, rather than 117 as envisaged in our Internationalisation Strategy. We have taken this decision so that we can continue to ensure that all mobilities are of high quality and the overall scope of the project is commensurate with the our organisational capacity and that of our partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOBILITY FLOWS\r\nThe project will provide a total of 100 mobilities for VET learners, timetabled as follows:\r\n\r\nSep-Dec 2018: 9 x 3 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nJan-Apr 2019: 9 x 3 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nJan-Jul 2019: 8 x 6 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nMar-Jun 2017: 9 x 3 month mobilities to France\r\n\r\nApr-Jul 2019: 9 x 3 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nSep-Dec: 2019: 9 x 3 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nJan-Apr 2020: 9 x 3 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nJan-Jul 2020: 8 x 6 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nFeb-May 2020: 9 x 3 month mobilities to France\r\n\r\nMar-Jun 2020: 12 x 3 month mobilities to Italy\r\n\r\nApr-Jul 2020: 9 x 3 month mobilities to Spain\r\n\r\nACCOMPANYING PERSONS\r\nWe will send 10 Accompanying Persons (APs) to reflect participants flows and mobility locations. APs will provide pastoral care and will be qualified IAG workers fluent in Spanish, French or Italian. Prior to and during mobilities they will liaise with participants and their support agencies to identify any additional needs arising as a result of undertaking the mobility, e.g. anxiety about living away from home or practical issues such as accommodation and housing support functions. APs will also ensure lines of communication between participants, DSC Regen and Host Employers remain open throughout mobilities and provide aftercare to ensure support reintegration with living and working in the UK.", "http://www.dscregen.co.uk", "DSC Regen Ltd", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047356_coordinator"], ["4RT", "Erasmus Pro Mobilities for Digital Media and the Creative Industries", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", 625142.0, "1) Developing our Internationalisation Strategy\r\nThe Erasmus Pro Mobilities for Digital Media and the Creative Industries (EPM for DMCI) project will offer VET learners opportunities to gain valuable European work experience and knowledge within the Digital Media and Creative Industries sectors.\r\n\r\nCapacity London\u2019s Internationalisation Strategy includes 4 organisational aims, which are supported by 7 objectives. The main activities and developments realised through the EPM for DMCI project are outlined below.\r\n\r\nAim 1: Develop a broader range of mobility opportunities\r\n\u2022 Objective A: Expanding our VET offer\r\n\u2022 Objective B:  Increasing the number of destination countries for VET mobilities\r\n\r\nThe French cultural industries are one of France\u2019s best performing economic sectors. Despite the economic conditions of the past few years, France\u2019s creative industries sector is still experiencing dynamic growth. Capacity London has brought forward the addition of France as a mobility destination in order to provide additional VET options to our learners and increase the number of destination countries. We anticipate including Italy in 2019 and Ireland and Portugal in 2020.\r\n\r\nAim 2: Increase employment outcomes\r\n\u2022 Objective C: Expand the number and range of host employers\r\n\u2022 Objective D: Increase the overall number of mobilities provided\r\n\r\nCapacity London continues to work with City & Guilds to offer courses from its suite of Digital Media and Creative Industries qualifications. Due to growing demand and the continued success rate of students on these courses we have decided to focus mobilities on these core areas. Teaching English is anticipated to be offered again in 2019 and discussions are on going with new potential host employers.\r\n\r\nAdditional host employers have been identified in Spain, the Czech Republic and France, which will enable us to offer a higher number of mobilities.\r\n\r\nAim 3: Increase progression to further learning\r\n\u2022 Objective E: Inclusion and Development of ECVET\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on a KA2 project \u2018ECVET for Creative Industries\u2019 to support curriculum development and facilitate credit transfer so that learners can continue to work towards their qualifications whilst undertaking mobilities. \r\n\r\nAim 4: Enhance organisational capacity within international contexts\r\n\u2022 Objective F: Increase language competence within organisation \r\n\u2022 Objective G: Increased Organisational Capacity Inline with Mobility Growth\r\n\r\nOur Erasmus+ provision falls within the scope of our Matrix Accreditation and we will work with Host Employers to support them in integrating Matrix methodologies and systems within their learner support functions.\r\n\r\nAs our European activities develop and expand, we continue to ensure staff develop relevant skills, for example by integrating a European dimension into our IAG services by providing detailed information about living and working in the destination countries for our Erasmus+ projects.  \r\n\r\nCapacity London staff benefit from the contribution the Erasmus+ projects make to language competences by providing opportunities for practice and development of language skills. This will continue as new destination countries are added.\r\n\r\n2) Mobility Flows\r\nThe project workplan and timetable will deliver a total of 90 3-month ErasmusPro Mobilities based around three \u2018lifecycles\u2019 with the following departure dates:\r\n\r\n1st cycle: Sep-Dec 2018 \u2013 21 Mobilities to Spain, 6 to Czech Republic, 3 to France\r\n\r\n2nd cycle: Jan-Apr 2019 \u2013 21 Mobilities to Spain, 6 to Czech Republic, 3 to France\r\n\r\n3rd cycle: Apr-July 2019 \u2013 21 Mobilities to Spain, 6 to Czech Republic, 3 to France\r\n\r\nWhilst this is an increase in the number of mobilities envisaged for 2018/19 within our Internationalisation Plan, it reflects our 2016 KA1 Mobility Project, which included a total of 98 3-month mobilities, 87 of which have been completed, with the remaining 11 underway and due to finish in April. Thus the proposed scope of the workplan is commensurate with capacity and delivery track record of Capacity London and the project partnership.\r\n\r\nWe had envisaged adding Ireland as a destination country but have added France via the development of partnerships with a cluster of Creative Industries employers in Perpignan.  These employers will provide high quality mobility placements that meet the needs of our participants and reflect the content of our VET provision and will also facilitate French language learning.\r\n\r\n3) Accompanying Persons\r\nWe will send an Accompanying Person to support the participants during the first stages of their mobilities as part of our duty of care to the young people undertaking work experience in another country. We have allocated a ratio of 1 Accompanying Person to every 9 participants and their key functions will be to:\r\n- Work with both the Host Employers and the Participants to ensure the start of the mobility work experience goes well;\r\n- Support participants in adapting to their new environment; and\r\n- Provide ongoing advice and support", "http://www.capacitylondon.co.uk", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047397_coordinator"], ["9JP", "REY Employability Enhancement Placements", "REY Europe Limited", 1447958.0, "Through this project, we will offer 300 VET-SHORT and 40 VET-PLONG mobilities.  \r\n\r\nOur target group are young people, aged 16-25,  who are often disadvantaged and have had limited/no previous opportunity to travel or live independently. The mobility provides an opportunity to push them out of their comfort zone and broaden their horizons and perspectives, developing their confidence in a supported environment. \r\n\r\nWe have a strong understanding of the needs of our participants and can offer a range of placement and accommodation models, appropriate support mechanisms and strong training model to meet these needs. Our flexible approach will support us to achieve our European Internationalisation Strategy (EIS) goal; to increase the volume and breadth of young people we engage.\r\n\r\nAt REY Europe, we offer young people employability training, with a mobility placement embedded as an integrated component of the course. Using non-formal training methodology, we aim to support young people to develop their confidence and readiness to enter the labour market. \r\n\r\nProject delivery is staggered throughout the year and we work in partnership with a number of UK organizations who have large volumes of participants who can be signposted to our projects. These partnerships are a key component in our model of recruitment, engagement and support for young people. One of our EIS goals is to diversify our UK partnerships. In this context, we plan to engage local youth employment organisations, as well as FE Colleges and we will invest resource in mapping out and developing this work. \r\n\r\nWe offer our employability course to vocational learners, up to Level 3, who are studying in the following areas; Hair & Beauty, Computing, Business, Travel & Tourism, Catering, Sport and Construction. Our placements are located in Greece, Spain, Czech Republic, France and Portugal. \r\n\r\nStudents are offered the employability course as an enhancement of their vocational qualification and the mobility activity is open to all students enrolled on the course. . The course offers unique benefits in terms of vocational, employability focused and soft skills development. Placements are aligned to each student\u2019s vocational course of study, giving them a chance to simultaneously develop their technical and soft skills, whilst considering aspects such as communication in the workplace, interview techniques and self development. \r\n\r\nParticipants will be joined by an accompanying person (AP) for the first and last week of their placement, at a ratio of 1:10. As our participants will have little, if any experience of travelling abroad or living independently, the AP will provides a crucial function in supporting participants to settle into their host country and accompanying participants whilst they are travelling.\r\n\r\nOur proposed VET-PLONG activity will be our first offer of longer terms placements to learners. We will offer 40 x 3 month placements to Level 3 graduates of \r\nVET construction courses (in Seville) \r\nVET business courses (in Prague) \r\nThis is an opportunity for students to develop their industry standards, knowledge and experience within the sector, as well as developing their soft skills and confidence in a work place environment. We have included, as an Annex, a more detailed plan for the roll-out of our VET-PLONG placements. \r\n\r\nWe have effective quality management and due diligence processes in place to ensure that our European partners meet our minimum standards and offer high quality, structured, well supported and safe placements for participants. Through regular face to face and remote contact and a clear quality assurance framework, we have set the tone for strong, productive working relationships with European partners. \r\n\r\nThe impact on participants is that they gain professional and personal skills, that will enhance both their employability and their technical aptitude in their vocational area. At a local level, this leads to improved motivation and workplace readiness amongst participants, and ultimately, increased employment and better employment opportunities for participants. Through the project, we will put participants in the strongest position to obtain employment, either locally or regionally.\r\n\r\nWe aim to inspire staff and, more widely, other VET training providers to get involved in mobility activity. We will encourage collaboration, good practice sharing and joint training events for participants and staff across different organisations. \r\n\r\nHost organizations will  benefit from a clearer framework for effective partnership working, a better understanding of the UK vocational sector, and more experience of working with our target group, including safeguarding and support requirements.\r\n\r\nCapturing the impact of our work is one of our EIS goals and we are exploring ways to diversify the way we gather and present our impact, so that we are presenting our work in a way that is meaningful and relevant to our audiences.", "http://www.reyeurope.org", "REY Europe Limited", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047500_coordinator"], ["6HT", "Medical Peace Work 3 - Strengthening Health Workers' Performance in Violence Prevention and Peace Building", "Medact", 232916.0, "Health work and peace work can be seen as two aspects of the same objective: Contributing to the wellbeing and prosperity of fellow citizens. Health professionals and their organisations often find themselves in a unique position to prevent or reduce violence and to promote peace. Since 2004, the European Medical Peace Work Partnership has developed training material on peace issues for health professionals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2011, seven Medical Peace Work (MPW) online courses were launched as a self-study option for health professionals. The courses, as well as a web-based resource centre for medical teachers and trainers, are available free of charge at www.medicalpeacework.org. By now, nearly 7.000 users have created an account at the online learning platform, and more than 730 certificates have been issued. The courses are accredited by the Norwegian Medical Association as standalone CME-credited courses (continuous medical education). They have also been applied in medical and health science education at various teaching institutions across Europe. \r\n\r\nFeedback has revealed that self-running online courses require a high level of self-discipline on the part of the students. Albeit a variety of online discussion solutions, individual online students also report a lack of peer contact, which is important to their ability to complete the course and to their practical skills training. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith MPW3, we wish to introduce Case-based learning (CBL) as a new teaching methodology. Our consortium of project partners plan to produce twelve new cases that will complement the existing MPW online courses. The new material will focus on skills training in teamwork and problem solving, and it can be used in face-to-face settings or in blended learning solutions when combined with the online courses. It can also be used outside educational institutions and even independently from skilled facilitators; our planned audio-visual case material and new team-focused online course will contain video guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary target group for MPW3 encompasses institutions of higher education and VET for health workers that provide teaching in MPW-related fields of study. Such fields include international health/global health, public health/social medicine, domestic violence prevention, crises prevention/intervention, trauma care, medical ethics & human rights, international humanitarian law, health diplomacy, communication, and conflict management. MPW3\u2019s secondary target group comprises individual health workers and teams of health workers interested in improving their performance in peace building and violence prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur ten partners constitute a combination of the expertise deemed necessary for this project. Organisations such as University of Bergen, IPPNW and Klinikum Nurnberg have extensive Medical Peace practice and education, and they have all formed part of the MPW consortium since 2004. We have also brought in a special organisation with particular expertise in creating and managing case-based learning material \u2013 the UK-based Case Centre. Also contributing to this project are new training institutions and organisations with the type of field and situation practice that will feed into the case development and ensure realistic, high quality scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplier events during the project period include co-organisation of the congress \u2018Medicine and Conscience\u2019, where there will be a special thematic focus on challenging peace-health situations in Europe. A workshop to train health educators in CBL methodology and gain their feedback on our material will be organised further into the project period. Finally, a symposium gathering peace-health educators from Europe and around the world will be held towards the final stages of the MPW3 project period. Dissemination will additionally be ensured through various channels that include our extensive peer networks, lobbying activities, the publication of texts and articles in relevant media, public relations events, MPW information material distributed at conferences, meetings and institutions, as well as accreditation and assimilation of the new CBL material into more health education institutions across Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that MPW3 focuses on case-based learning solutions is a symptom of the MPW network\u2019s eagerness to design sustainable training solutions. CBL comes up as a learning method that caters for the learning capacities and needs of the next generation of students. MPW3 will enable us to bridge the material already produced in MPW 1 and 2 with a methodological approach designed for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical Peace Work as a field of expertise has gradually developed over the past decade. Our network of partners and supporters continues to grow, as does the demand for designated and freely accessible teaching material. As long as there are health workers interested in using their special role to build peace and prevent violence, Medical Peace Work has a place in European health education.", "http://www.medact.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-NO01-KA200-000441_9"], ["7RQ", "Green Entrepreneurs Europe", "BUSINESS IN THE COMMUNITY", 206917.0, "Europe needs more young people with green entrepreneurship skills if it is to achieve its EU2020 target of \u2018Sustainable growth - for a resource efficient, greener and more competitive economy.\u2019 Delivering this target requires young people with the skills, knowledge and commitment to build a more competitive low-carbon economy that makes efficient and sustainable use of resources, protects the environment, reduces emissions and prevents biodiversity loss. \r\n\r\nThe green economy is an increasing source of jobs in Europe (CEDEFOP) and Eurobarometer (2013) reports that green skills in SMEs are increasing with 4/10 employing at least one full-time employee working in a green job. Recent research shows that start-up rates increase by as much as 20% when entrepreneurship lessons are provided in schools. \r\n\r\nThe GEE (Green Entrepreneurship Europe) project brings together the twin necessities of a green economy and increased entrepreneurship that provides meaningful jobs and restores our natural wealth. GEE will improve the capacity of schools to teach the competencies and skills for young people to take an active role in the green economy and strengthen cooperation between school and the world of work. GEE has been identified by the partners as a response to the need for a pan-European response to building the green economy, a belief shared by our project schools that have identified entrepreneurship education as a priority.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of GEE is \u2018to improve the key competencies and skills of young people to take an active role in building the green economy and strengthen cooperation between school and the world of work.\u2019 We will achieve this through linked specific objectives:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve the capacity of schools to connect learning with the world of work within the context of building a green economy.\r\n\u2022 Provide pupils with a range of meaningful real-world experiences linking the classroom with business and entrepreneurship.\r\n\u2022 Develop the skills and competencies of pupils to rethink business models in-line with the need to build a green economy.\r\n\u2022 Enhance the ability of teachers to teach entrepreneurship.\r\n\u2022 Increase the sharing of educational resources for schools across Europe.\r\n\u2022 This will result in new shared green entrepreneurship resources to support schools throughout the EU. \r\n\u2022 Share and enhance good practice in integrating sustainable development into business thinking.\r\n\r\nIn delivering the specific objectives listed above we will work with 15 associate secondary schools in five countries, 30 teachers and approximately 375 pupils. Through dissemination and exploitation activities we aim to reach a further 125 secondary schools, impacting 3125 pupils, and 250 teachers as well as education providers and local education departments. The project results will be freely available as open online resources during and beyond the project.\r\n\r\nThe overall impact of GEE will be to improve the competencies and skills of young people to take an active role in building the green economy and strengthen cooperation between school and the world of work. Pupils will benefit from entrepreneurial learning, developing business knowledge, essential skills and attitudes including creativity, initiative, tenacity, teamwork, understanding of risk and a sense of responsibility. This is the entrepreneurial mind-set that helps entrepreneurs transform ideas into action and also significantly increases employability.\r\n\r\nGEE blends two learning approaches: learning outside the classroom and real world learning. Learning is embedded through student\u2019s direct contact with business and entrepreneurs. We will connect schools with local businesses and entrepreneurs so that they can work together to develop green business plans and ideas for new products based on reality rather than fantasy. \r\n\r\nGEE methods develop entrepreneurial solutions that support a green and sustainable economy. To achieve this it uses the natural world as a metaphor and measure for sustainability. Outdoor learning helps pupils understand how nature works and the key operating principles. For example in nature waste from one process is food for another creating a virtuous cycle rather than the linear take-make-dump found in traditional business models. GEE applies these principles from nature to business through creating entrepreneurship ideas. Pupils use natural principles to explore what some businesses are already achieving (GEE case studies), work with real businesses and entrepreneurs through our Coffee House Challenge Events, and finally develop their own business ideas and plans which are shared with local business.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the activities developed for pupils, we will offer online and face-to-face support for teachers and schools, and disseminate the results widely through teacher seminars, conferences and a project website.", "http://www.bitcni.org.uk", "Field Studies Council", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013501_9"], ["6HQ", "THE POWER OF DATA TO TAKE SMART DECISIONS FOR SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT", "EDURIO LTD", 278705.0, "The DATADRIVE project aims to explore innovative ways of empowering teachers and school leaders, by giving them methodological tools, instruments and training to develop their skills and competences to read, interpret and use different types of data so as to support evidence-driven school improvement.

When teachers use credible, quality data to evaluate  and inform school improvement, they can better approach complex problems, address diversity and support all their students and engage them to increase their performance. To support the teachers and school leaders in acquiring these skills, the DATADRIVE project will review existing literature, practices, frameworks and instruments related to school quality and data use and collect new evidence from practitioners to build a new school quality framework and survey instruments to measure the underlying school quality dimensions as well as a data-driven school improvement framework both that can be accessed on any digital platform. Using these ICT-based methodologies, training material and instructional videos will be created in line with the identified needs, and school leader and teacher teams in selected schools will be invited to create a participatory governance structure and be coached to collaborate as professional learning communities to use these frameworks and instruments. \r\n\r\nCoordinated by Luxembourg, the DATADRIVE project has teamed up with 5 other partners: the Ministry of Education of Croatia, the Autonomous Highschool of the German-speaking Community in Belgium, the University of Twente in Netherlands, the SPOLECZNA AKADEMIA NAUK University in Poland and Edurio Ltd. UK, a small and medium enterprise that helps school network leaders both in public and private sectors establish an evidence-based approach to school improvement in their organisations. \r\nThe DATADRIVE project will gather evidence from participating countries on school quality dimensions and data-driven decision-making practices to create a school quality framework, a data-driven school improvement framework, content survey material and corresponding teaching material and videos and a handbook  on data-driven school improvement for professional learning community teams in schools. At the end of the project, national workshops with all stakeholders will be held to familiarize them with methods of gathering and analysing data and how project outputs can be used to impact the way decision-making is done in schools.\r\n\r\nThe desired impact is to have content (frameworks, surveys, training content) for education quality monitoring and improvement tailored to specific school needs. While the content will be meant for application on a school/school network level, it can also be tailored to the needs of larger education institutions and networks. Impact will be seen when school leaders and teachers will be \r\nready to make data-driven changes. Dissemination will be addressed to school leaders and teachers of all schools, teacher-training institutes, national departments working with schools on quality improvement, as well as national and international level education policy-makers. All project outputs will be stored on the DATADRIVE website, partner websites and will be available for download free of charge. The video trainings will be available on the DATADRIVE website, Youtube and will be distributed to participating countries training institutions.\r\n\r\nWith the growing emphasis on digital national and international assessments, where technology is increasingly used to enhance teaching and learning, DATADRIVE also aims to make effective use of technological resource tools that promote innovative ways of collecting and using data to improve the quality of education. In other words, accurate, reliable and timely data made available to school leaders and teachers who are equipped with expertise and tools to use them meaningfully will enable them to direct their support exactly where it is needed.", "http://www.edurio.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-LU01-KA201-037314_2"], ["7RQ", "A Structured Internship Programme to Aid the Professionalization of Skilled and Unemployed Young People with the Aim of Securing Employment", "BUSINESS IN THE COMMUNITY", 202936.0, "The YouthEmploy project provides a response to the EU wide crises of youth unemployment through the development & introduction of an innovative cloud-based framework to support VET providers, employers & unemployed young people to undertake & validate relevant & practical work experience & by so doing prevent & break the cycle of structural employment & lost generation effect threatening young people today.

We will work with 6 partner countries, who all offer structured international work placements that contribute directly to their learners\u2019 vocational course of study, avoiding the need for classroom based duplication. Our target group is vocational learners, studying qualifications up to level 3. Most learners are young people who may not have travelled/studied abroad previously.Through national mapping activities, we will gain an insight into approaches to validating work based (WB) learning in different European contexts and understand the challenges/barriers faced by the key actors within mobility activity, in terms of their engagement with ECVET. In response to our findings, we will develop six intellectual outputs (IOs), through which we will offer innovative approaches to supporting the key actors to better engage with the ECVET process and understand how their roles are interlinked. IOs will be led by different partners, according to the topic and their own area of expertise. A corresponding transnational meeting will be hosted by the partner leading the specific IO.We will develop resources for each stakeholder group, to support the implementation of ECVET and the achievement of credit bearing LOs. Resources will be accessible and user friendly, in order to demystify the implementation of ECVET and encourage active engagement with the framework. We intend for the materials produced to be used in a range of European contexts.We expect 1360 participants to be indirectly impacted by the project itself. This can be broken down into three key stakeholder groups, learners, vocational college tutors, and host organisation mentors.We will carry out a pilot mobility activity to provide an opportunity to test the resources developed as well as gathering feedback from other stakeholders at national level. The results we expect to see are:>The development of an approach to break down the perceived barriers to using ECVET by simplifying the approach to evidencing learning outcomes.> Stronger integration of WB mobility opportunities into vocational curricula> Improved learner mobility experience> Improved cultural awareness of staff, and increased international staff development opportunities> Increased awareness of mobility activity as a credit bearing course component amongst national accrediting bodies.By directly engaging national accrediting bodies we hope to raise their awareness of mobility activity as a viable learning opportunity that will be credit bearing for learners. We will also examine how the national accrediting bodies correspond to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF).

We expect this to lead to a more cohesive transnational framework and formal recognition of WB learning opportunities, which will increase the portability of national accreditation. By achieving greater recognition of work based mobility placements as a viable and enhancing component of a vocational course, we see the potential for impact amongst all stakeholders involved; vocational colleges, we expect to see  stronger integration of mobility activity as part of their wider internationalisation/course enhancement strategy. Learners will be encouraged and better supported to broaden their horizons and access the European labour market, and to be able to demonstrate a set of key skills and expertise through a widely recognised framework. We expect the project to lead to improved access to WB learning opportunities that are formally validated by the learning institution and their accrediting body, and an increase in the number of validated WB learning opportunities taken up by students.

Professionals in primary care are increasingly  expected to answer patient queries about genetic conditions, deliver genetic information and triage patients who require genetic or other specialist services.    This requires appropriate skills and genetics knowledge to deliver care in daily practice that addresses patient needs, reduces morbidity and mortality and maximises the use of health resources.  Genetics education is only very slowly starting to become a common part of medical curricula and continuing medical education that is case based and grounded in daily practice of primary care practitioners is urgently needed.   However, postgraduate training programmes in primary care and public health are currently failing to meet these perceived educational needs, for example for general practitioners and midwives. This project has been designed to help primary health care workers to identify patients who may have a condition or healthcare concern with a significant genetic component and to manage the patient appropriately.   \r\nThe aim of the project is to implement adult education via an innovative Train the Trainers programme in genomic healthcare among European primary care practitioners.  The education will be embedded in a Care Bundle that includes appropriate tools and resources for use in daily clinical practice.  This project will be achieved via a partnership between expert patients and specialists in adult education, primary care and health genetics to achieve the long-term outcome of improvement in care of patients with genetic conditions or concerns.  The objectives are to:\r\n1) conduct an educational needs assessment in genetics for primary care practitioners and produce a course curriculum \r\n2) produce a Care Bundle with both education and practical clinical tools to facilitate primary care practitioners to provide care for patients with genetic conditions or concerns   \r\n3) deliver adult education for primary care practitioners in six countries\r\n4) create a sustainable online educational training course for primary care practitioners in Europe. \r\n\r\nA needs assessment (systematic review and stakeholder meeting) regarding education and training required by primary care practitioners to deliver effective genetic healthcare will be undertaken as a basis for the curriculum.  The educational programme will be embedded into a 'Care Bundle' for primary care practitioners that will include not only the training component, but tools and resources for practical use in clinical settings.  We will use 'Train the Trainers' methodology to deliver the adult education programme to a core group of practitioners, who will then also be equipped to train others in their own countries to provide genetic healthcare to patients.  This will be interactive, case based and incorporate feedback from actual patients in each country.    Using links with European and national patient groups, we will include interactive training sessions with real patients and online sessions with simulated patients: this is innovative in medical education in general and genetics education in particular.  After an initial pilot course, the training programme will be modified according to feedback, translated for use and delivered in at least six European countries.  In addition, the online course will be available in an asynchronous version for those who wish to undertake training in their own time.   Sustainability will be assured through publication of outputs for use of educators and hosting of the course webpages by the European Society of Human Genetics, a stable pan-European organisation, the mission of which includes support of professional education and adoption of the programme by national professional organisations.   \r\nUsing Kirkpatrick's model of educational outcomes (Kirkpatrick 1967), we will test changes in knowledge and skills of the adult learners via an online survey, but will also evaluate changes in clinical practice and patient care through interviews with a proportion of learners three months after they have completed the course.  \r\nThe programme will enhance understanding of the appropriate management of patients with genetic conditions or concerns in primary care practitioners, improving the quality of healthcare in Europe.  Through use of the Train the Trainers model,  we will create a cohort of peer trainers that will exponentially increase the impact of the programme, as will the availabiity of the online  training programme for at least five years beyond the project. Although this proposal covers education delivered in six languages, the programme will be freely available for others to translate into their own languages for their use nationally, creating further impact on practitioner knowledge and skills  in Europe.", "http://www.geneticalliance.org.uk  ", "UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA204-000065_2"], ["9RL", "Open Educational Resources \u2013 Raising Effectiveness of Volunteering in Europe through Adult Learning REVEAL II", "National Council for Voluntary Organisations", 195617.0, "OER-REVEAL-2 is fully in line of priority #2 of Strategic Partnership \u201csupport the production and adoption of OER in diverse EU languages.

At present, an estimated 92 to 95 million adult Europeans actively engage in volunteering activities for an aggregate contribution to the GDP of Member States varying between 0.5 to 5%; EU Commission, DG EAC, 2010 \u201cVolunteering in EU (VEU)\u201d. In addition, volunteering is a significantly relevant platform for informal and non-formal learning of various groups of society, thanks to its inherent mechanisms for peer-to-peer collaboration and knowledge sharing. At the same time, volunteering is a unique platform for intergenerational learning, as it promotes mutual understanding and learning between elderly and youth. Ultimately, volunteering triggers positive spill-over in European economy and society as a unique mechanism for greater social inclusion not only for the beneficiaries of volunteering services but also for the volunteers. This is even more important when volunteering is considered as a pivot for intergenerational linkages, as a means to promote social inclusion of an ageing population and active citizenship of the young part of society.\r\n\r\nYet, many capacity constraints undermine the efficacy and impact of volunteering as a whole: volunteering organisations seldom have the right set of managerial skills to maximize the impact of their activities. This low organisational capacity has manifold negative implications for volunteering as a whole, producing the following shortcomings:\r\n\r\n- misallocation of resources due to improper planning and management\r\n\r\n- diminished impact on beneficiaries of volunteering activities\r\n\r\n- jeopardised sustainability of volunteering activities and organisations\r\n\r\n- dispersions of (human) resources and low retention of volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \u201cprofessionalization of volunteering\u201d (DG EAC, Volunteering in EU 2010) requires effective management of resources and planning of volunteering activities, otherwise vulnerable to inefficiencies. Many evidences pinpoint the binding constraint to effective volunteering because of capacity shortcomings, this is accurately captured by the EC, DG EAC, 2010, \u201cVEU Final Report\u201d, p.230: \u201cProfessionalisation also means that volunteers are confronted with increasingly demanding tasks that require specific competences and skills\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will allow to formalise and value knowledge while identifying training needs of individual volunteers. OER-REVEAL-2 will prompt adult learning solutions to address those needs with the ultimate aim of enhancing, through effective Adult Learning, the relevance, efficiency and impact of volunteering throughout EU.\r\n\r\nOER-REVEAL-2 builds on the success and lessons of REVEAL, a best practice project funded by the Lifelong Learning Programme. In this follow-up proposal, the partnership will:\r\n\r\nA) widen the geographical scale by including new countries and languages.

According to EMCDDA, there were 1.3 million opioid users in Europe for 2014 alone, among which 30.000 pregnant women and 6,000 users who passed away due to drug use. The main suggested therapies for the drug withdrawal period and relapse prevention are pharmacological, such as the administration of opioid agonists, non-agonists and antagonists. However,  scientific research has shown that these forms of treatment carry a high risk for continued physical dependence and have been found to be insufficient in treating substance dependence without additional treatment. For these reasons different therapeutic modalities have been introduced independently or as an adjunct therapy and have proven to be effective in facilitating detoxification and sustaining abstinence during drug rehabilitation. Music therapy is one of them, as it has gained therapists' interest due to its capacity to have a significantly positive impact on the physical, psychological, mental and social functions of drug addicted individuals. However, despite the scientific evidence concerning the benefits of musical interventions for the treatment of drug addiction, a surprisingly large gap exists in regards to a properly organized network of information dissemination and, more importantly, of professionals' education and training.  \r\nThe aim of the proposed project is the creation of a European-level strategic partnership and know-how exchange network and the preparation, development and implementation of a large-scale training program on the use of music as an complementary therapeutic intervention during the detoxification and rehabilitation processes of individuals suffering from drug dependence. The project's acronym is MUS.I.C.D.A.RE. (MUSic In Creative Detoxification And REhabilitation). The  target population of the project are 210 carers, therapists, psychologists, social workers, volunteers and ex-drug dependent individuals employed or intending to be actively involved or employed in drug detoxification and rehabilitation centers in Europe. Emphasis will be given on balancing transnational and national participants in the training programs, and in attracting ex-drug addicted individuals to participate as trainees. \r\nThe project will consist of the following activities: \r\n1) Exchange of know-how, expertise and best practices among researchers, specialists and practitioners in the specific field of using music as an interventional therapeutic approach in the detoxification and rehabilitation processes of  drug dependent individuals. \r\n2) Design of a unified - accredited - training program  for the aforementioned target group, on the use of music in the detoxification and rehabilitation process of drug dependent individuals, consisting of educating participants on the theoretical principles, research findings but mainly of providing workshop-type learning experiences (experiential learning of principles, methodology and practical applications) through study visits, on-site observations, and 'learning-by-doing'.\r\n3) Creation of the project\u2019s portal.\r\n4) Implementation of the 7-day MUS.I.C.D.A.RE. joint staff training program in the three participating  countries. \r\n5) Development and implementation of the E-course (E-MUS.I.C.D.A.RE.) with participants from across Europe for multiplying effects. \r\n6) Evaluation of the three implementations of the 7-day MUS.I.C.D.A.RE training event and the E-MUS.I.C.D.A.RE course. \r\n7) Creation of an E-book titled \"Handbook of Best Practices: Music in Creative Detoxification and Rehabilitation\".\r\n8) Multiplier Activities: Mid- conference, final conference, closing festival.\r\n9) Dissemination activities throughout the life of the project.\r\n10 Creation of the MUS.I.C.D.A.RE.

It will also bridge the gap between the scientific community, the active field of addiction treatment and the related labor markets via the exchange of significant know-how. This can result in the amelioration of the strategic development, organizational management and quality of learning provision both for scientific experts and the therapeutic personnel of the rehabilitation centers.  Furthermore, this partnership envisions fostering equity, inclusion and high quality targeted activities in education, training and youth in order to promote the personal, social and professional growth and reinsertion of  ex- drug addicted individuals.

It was organized to bring as many people as possible to the Conference of Parties, the yearly negotiating space for governments under the United Framework Conference on Climate Change, which was taking place in Warsaw. The train brought together a wide range of organizations, movements and citizens - young and old - and provided a platform for exchange, learning and cooperation. Upon return, leading individuals from the different participating organizations decided to build on the success of the project and start to prepare an even bigger mobilization for the COP21 in Paris 2015. \r\n\r\nThe organization Climate Express (BE) was founded and cooperation was sought with Bizi (FR) and the Campaign against Climate Change (UK) to launch a transnational project titled \u201cMobilizing Citizens for Climate Solutions\u201d. There are close to thirthy young and dynamic individuals leading this project and around hundred volunteers involved. The leaders are coming from a broad range of youth movements and organizations in Belgium, France and the UK and together bring a wide range of skills to the project: leadership and coordination skills, project planning and implementation, campaign design, communication skills, website design, accountancy, fundraising, education skills and working specifically with youth.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are (1) to sensitize and mobilize citizens from Belgium, France and the United Kingdom around the challenges of our generation, specifically climate change; (2) to bring thousands of them physically to the COP21 in Paris; and to (3) showcase the wide range of solutions emerging within civil society, to provide a vision for a just transition.\r\n\r\nThe planned activities fit into three stages. First there will be a decentralized phase in which partners sensitize and mobilize citizens around climate solutions in own countries. This will include a local tour in France and Belgium, on tandem and by train repectively, to visit local communities and engage with citizens. We will further organize an event called \u201cAlternatiba\u201d in at least 30 cities: a village of alternatives to climate change. It aims at gathering different popular and inclusive alternatives to climate change that are already being practiced by the population (regarding such different areas as housing, energy, agriculture and food, etc) in a single, popular and festive event, in order to demonstrate how a more sustainable and fair society can also be a better place to live together. This mobilization phase will be followed by a centralized phase in which collective transport is organized from each country to the COP21 and a joint program is offered during the conference. We want to mobilize at least 12 000 people from the UK and Belgium to join us to Paris. This time we will not only go by train, but also by bus, by bike and on foot to the negotiations! This part of the project will go beyond only the logistics of the transport. Workshops, trainings, citizens\u2019 assemblies, concerts, etc will be organized along the way. We want to bring together social movements, ecological organisations, trade unions, young and old, and excluded groups and focus on what unites us rather than what divides us. During the COP21 we aim for a strong citizens presence, raising their voice, showing that solutions exists and holding governments to account. Finally, after the COP21, there will be another decentralized follow-up phase in the different participating countries, where the results of the COP21 will be discussed at various for and follow-up actions will be planned. A documentary will be made during the project, which will be broadly disseminated upon return from Paris.\r\n\r\nThe aim of our project is to re-activate citizens involvement in this crucial debate which has too often taken place above their heads or is perceived as something that does not affect them directly. We want to bring a positive message. The doom and gloom message around climate change has paralyzed citizens and governments alike. Our focus will be on the opportunity this crisis creates to build a more sustainable and just society.

And, we are talking about universal problem, with millions of such cases across the EU (Barry, 2006). The charges are ranging from minor status offences, such as theft, to such serious crimes such as burglary, robbery, violence, homicide etc. Afterwards, they more often than not face social exclusion and very limited future prospects, which leads them back to crime. \r\n\r\nHow to avoid that? It is socially accepted that youth centre/worker is a good investment if it/he/she diverts at least one youngster from crime. The project \u201cClimb-Over\u201d is just about that: making good use of youth work to prevent teens/youth from making offences, as well as help reintegration of young offenders. In essence, CO aims to create a special programme in which youth workers would include young offenders in their work with youth. \r\n\r\nObjectives to achieve this: 1) identify the most common crimes youth are committing, and look for ways to reduce them; 2) enhance youth\u2019s awareness on the impact of crime on communities and families; 3) re-integrate young offenders faster by involving them in youth work; 4) prevent young offenders from re-offending; 5) raise the qualifications and competences of youth workers, who could work together with young offenders; 6) spread tolerance and mutual understanding between young offenders and non-offenders. \r\n\r\nNaturally, the main target groups of the project are young offenders, non-offending youth (and youth at risk), youth workers and parents. The number of them to be benefited directly by CO is 2550. However this does not include people that will be reached by continuing dissemination activities and self-sustainable deliverables after the project. \r\n\r\nTo fulfil what is planned, CO will have a total duration of 2 years [from IX 2018 to VIII 2020]. Its activities will take place in Lithuania, United Kingdom and Croatia. These can be grouped into the following: \r\n- Research on the best ways to integrate young offenders & youth at risk into youth work;\r\n- Staff training on how to re-integrate young ex-offenders through youth work;\r\n- Methodology creation on how to include young offenders & youth at risk into youth work, as well as prevent juvenile delinquency;\r\n- Multiplier events to promote the methodology, match young offenders and youth workers and prepare for social integration events; \r\n- Pilot programme that would test the methodology through events for youth in UK, Croatia and Lithuania. \r\n- Online platform creation for re-integration of young ex-offenders through youth work;\r\n- SOcial Shock (SOS) \u2013 youth competition for developing social advertisements aimed at increasing awareness of re-integration of young ex-offenders;\r\n- Creation of social advertisements on youth delinquency;\r\n- Further dissemination & continuation activities. \r\n\r\nAs it is seen from the above, the project will produce a range of tangible results, which are essentially grouped into 2 intellectual outputs: 1) CO methodology to include young offenders into youth work & prevent juvenile delinquency; and (2) Tools for Re-integration of Young Ex-offenders. \r\n\r\nThese products are going to impact the target audiences in all the project countries. Firstly, youth work will be improved by involving young offenders & youth at risk with their skills and experience. This will, in turn, add up to qualifications of the youth workers. Both participating young offenders and youth will also improve skills & competencies, extend their social networks and decrease xenophobia and ghettoism coming from both sides. All of this will have a positive impact on their future careers/life. \r\n\r\nLooking from a purely young offenders\u2019 perspective, they will be able to reintegrate back to society faster. CO\u2019s results will also give more recognition of similar social initiatives aiming to support young (ex-)offenders. Ideally, this could lead to more of those being implemented and, generally, a more accurate public opinion towards ex-convicts. \r\n\r\nPartner organisations have designed the project with self-sustainability in mind. That is why, the focus is on quality of the resources produced and their universal applicability in the European context. In line with Erasmus+ standards, the deliverables will be made free and openly accessible.\r\n\r\nThat and the fact that juvenile delinquency is seemingly without an end and felt across all of the world including EU, ensures that CO stays relevant in the long-term.

The three years EwasteR journey, undertaken through a series of nine closely related work packages, developed and established the partnership as a collaborative high performance team.  The EwasteR project addressed the increasingly relevance of the Electrical and electronic waste (E-waste) sector in Europe which is currently the largest growing waste stream. Recycling of WEEE is a specialist part of the waste and recycling industry. Indeed, waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) such as computers, TV-sets, fridges and cell phones is one the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with some 9 million tonnes generated in 2005, and expected to grow to more than 12 million tonnes by 2020.WEEE is a complex mixture of materials and components that because of their hazardous content, and if not properly managed, can cause major environmental and health problems. Moreover, the production of modern electronics requires the use of scarce and expensive resources (e.g., around 10% of total gold worldwide is used for their production). To improve the environmental management of WEEE and to contribute to a circular economy and enhance resource efficiency the improvement of collection, treatment and recycling of electronics at the end of their life is essential.The main beneficiaries of the project are young aspiring workers/technicians and entrepreneurs (learners) wishing to work in the weee recycling and reuse management sector, but the project also provides substantial benefits to the organisations working in the circular economy area using VET as a tool to increase employability chances for those learners at the European level.The aim of the EwasteR project has been to emphasise the relationship between waste creation and resource management and to demonstrate the need for skills, competence and experience of entrepreneurs and specialists in devising a solution and/or an appropriate intervention. The project had four concrete key objectives, including:-Overcome the challenges of vocational skills mismatches in the WEEE re-use sector and give supportto it;-Contribute to the development of new solutions in VET system;-Ensure the highest possible relevance for all targets groups and stakeholders involved;-Create new conditions for providing employment and training opportunities and supporting national Qualifications award in the sector with growth potential (green jobs).The future for the practice that has been developed in EwasteR depends on three key factors and these have been the focus of the exploitation strategy. These factors are:-Evidence of the demand for the recognition and validation of new professional qualifications in WEEE recycling and reuse management sector to implement the NQF and RQF of different Countries across Europe;-The development of new European initiatives that enables the development of a strategic sector skills alliance for VET providers and professionals, employers, experts, and stakeholders concerning Circular Economy system and sustainable development across Europe;-The potential to encourage training-exchanging experience across Europe and to work for an effective impact in the VET and labour systems at all levels.", "http://www.lcrn.org.uk", null, "erasmus_554341-EPP-1-2014-1-IT-EPPKA2-SSA_2"], ["4RT", "Anticipatory Skills for Adapting the Publishing sector", "CAPACITY LONDON LIMITED", 791412.0, "The Digital Agenda for Europe estimates that the publishing industries employ around 750,000 jobs in more than 64,000 companies in EU.

Because 95% of what we learn comes through sight and hearing, deafblind people face unique challenges in communication, mobility and accessing information, making deafblindness one of the most isolating of disabilities. Deafblind people are profoundly excluded due to the lack of understanding of their complex needs and limited expectations of them. In most poor countries there is little awareness about deafblindness and consequently no support exists. They face huge challenges, but with the right support it is possible for them to lead quality lives and be active members of society.  This project aims to develop innovative approaches to addressing the training needs of young people with deafblindness in India and Bangladesh that can be shared with other low income and middle income countries.   We designed a project that will deliver a positive impact on individual participants in non-formal training in particular: more active participation in society; and more opportunities for young people with deafblindness in gaining an education or accessing jobs by creating greater  interconnections between formal, non-formal education, vocational training, and the labour market.

Sport is a growing social and economic phenomenon which makes an important contribution to the EU's strategic objectives of solidarity and prosperity. However, sport is confronted with a number of threats from which athletes and citizens in general need to be protected, such as violence, discrimination, intolerance and manipulation of results. Based on these ideas, general objective of PsyTool project has been to take full advantage from the implementation of the Sport Psychology as a strategic tool to promote integrity and tackle violence, discrimination, intolerance and match-fixing among young practitioners of grassroots sports. To achieve this goal a complete methodology was established and has been followed by partnership.After the development of a research phase with the purpose of identifying the state of the art, next step from a methodological point of view was the identification of \"Agents of Change\" (coaches, trainers, teachers, referees, parents, journalists and others stakeholders responsible for the delivery of grassroots sport), selected to take part of the PsyTool training program.The next important milestone was the creation of the Web Educational Tool \u2013 PsyTool Platform, created to train the \"Agents of Change\" and the elaboration of training materials for them. Then, the implementation phase started. It was integrated by 2 main activities, which impacted into main project direct target groups: \"Agents of Change\" and final beneficiaries (young practitioners of grassroots sports). These activities have been: \u2022             Training period of \"Agents of Change\" (both online and face-to-face trainings).
