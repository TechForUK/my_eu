Some Midlothian schools are already well underway in their exciting journey in implementing effective language programmes in schools.  At Stobhill we feel that we have a great need to develop our knowledge and skills so that we too can embark on our exciting journey in taking forward the promotion and implementation of French fully in August 2016 in line with our School/ASG Improvement Plan. Having attended several language twilight courses, we have identified that the four participants mentioned in this application all have very different experiences/levels of French.  We are all in agreement that by visiting France and being fully immersed in a French programme of study and by experiencing the culture first-hand that this would be the most invaluable and memorable way of inspiring our learners back in the classroom.  Furthermore, we believe that we will all be able to share our experiences with the rest of our colleagues at Stobhill in order, not only to motivate them, but also to instill a real enthusiasm for learning French across all stages of the school.The immersion programme embraces the key principles of Curriculum for Excellence, therefore, being given this opportunity as lifelong learners ourselves, can only serve to ensure that the French learning programmes we will create and deliver will reflect the seven principles of curriculum design.  Moreover, when teachers receive positive, relevant and meaningful CPD experiences then this can ensure \"positive, relevant and meaningful learning programmes\" can be created and delivered by all staff.  Bruner advocates that the most effective way to learn is through active discovery and as we all support Bruner's theory we believe that this course is ideal, giving us the opportunity to fully embrace the 1+2 approach in line with Government policy.This course encompasses learning French with native speakers, developing a greater cultural awareness and discovering new ways of teaching languages through a variety of media.  This course offers invaluable training in the teaching of foreign languages to young learners through observing and participating in modelled activities.  A real incentive of attending this course is the facility to network with other professionals from across Scotland and France, share resources and good practice.  We were also delighted to discover that on completion of this project we will receive a pen-drive containing many tried and tested resources and activities. By having a bank of resources, which can be adapted to suit the interests and needs of all learners at all levels, this enables teachers to plan exciting lessons to engage all our children in language learning.
