Parents are more and more demanding nowadays and this is why we care for creating a very good school based on modern methods of work. We focus on pre-school education because we see the parents' awareness and their expectations for good quality of teaching. In order to bring changes and pedagogical innovations we want to show teachers, headmasters and local authorities involved in education new models of teaching through mobilities and visits in the other country. Our main purpose is to learn about innovative educational methods of work and school management. We hope that through mobilities we will change the way of thinking of our authorities involved in education, they will not be afraid of changes, implement new solutions into their work, teachers will improve their language competence to be used in class with children. We would like our teachers to use some basic English at work with the children. Now they are not ready to do this. Our kindergartens in the commune have already had some experience in international cooperation so we found our partners easily. We've decided to choose the English kindergarten because we think that the British model of education is very good and we would like to implement some of their ideas in our system. We would like to copy their good practice and use them in our schools. Exchange of ideas and pedagogical experience will definitely bring good results for our school which will improve quality of teaching, get European dimension. During the project we want to organise one visit to the partner kindergarten in England, our teachers will spend 5 working days in the school in Leeds. They will work according to the plan and schedule which will be arranged  and agreed by both partner schools. The main purpose of the visit in the school will be to know as well as possible the partner institution, its system of work, exchange pedagogical experience, learn from each other. The Polish teachers will take part in activities in the partner school in the morning and in the afternoon, every day so that they can know the partner institution well.", "http://www.valleyviewschool-pri.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-PL01-KA101-000379_1"], ["1DD", "\"Learning without Limits\"\r\n(exploring the potential for learning for all when no limits exist in terms of disadvantage or geography)", "Valley View Community Primary School", 277246.0, "This project \u2013\"Learning without Limits\" (exploring the potential for learning for all when no limits exist in terms of disadvantage or geography)\u2013 will see seven partner organisations working together to share expertise and offer collaborative reflection on three key issues which affect many schools throughout the EU.\r\nTogether with our pupils we will consider three themes:\r\n1- The impact of play on learning and how schools can best incorporate play so that all children, whatever their starting point, can use play to learn to their potential. We will share ideas on the ways to reach the most reluctant families and will together consider reasons why some of our children feel less engaged than others with the school system.\r\n2- The place of ICT in school and indeed in life-long learning. We will look at the ways which business makes use of technology and see how this is used at all stages of production. Our children will compare the ideal with the realistic and will consider how to make an action plan to move their school gradually towards the next stage technologically.\r\n3- Aspiration and job prospects in a European Union context. Our children will look at their employment prospects and wil consider this internationally. After talking to employers and employees who have migrated from one country to another, our children wil take time to reflect on the skills they would need to move across international boundaries to further their job prospects. We will target children from more disadvantaged backgrounds and will introduce then to young adults who can inspire them and raise their aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe 7 countries involved have previous experience of working with at least one other country previously and we are therefore confident that we can therefore use our established international skills to begin our project promptly and can deal with the content and themes of our project successfully.\r\n\r\nOur children will compare the themes in an international forum, and will achieve a balance between researching what happens in their own country, before then visiting another to look how systems are different. \r\n\r\nAll our schools are concerned about the progress and aspiration of all children and we would all like to raise the attainment of our most disadvantaged children. However, we are all aware that the expertise and skill to narrow the attainment gap is not limited by country borders. Our education systems work independently of one another and we would make every effort to share skills from every country.\r\n\r\nWe intend that our children will develop a mindset which allows them to aim high and aim wide. We would like them to see their future within Europe as a whole, rather than being limited to the country where they were born or where they currently live.\r\n\r\nActivities include:\r\n- professional evaluation of play in a range of settings and how play differs from one age group to another. Discussions around ways in which formal settings make reference to home 'play' situations and how these can affect disadvantaged children\r\n-children's studies and reflections of cultural variation in play and how this varies over time and generations. Consideration of the concept of 'culture' and how this changed through migration.\r\n- professionals meeting and collating a paper with collected policies and research from across 7 countries on play  and learning\r\n- children attend conference on technology and see technology in business settings\r\n- children see technologically advanced schools and consider realistic and aspirational approaches.  They consider action\r\n planning and democratic processes\r\n- children present to own countries action plans around becoming more technologically advanced\r\n- disadvantaged pupils visit workplaces and universities to talk to employees students and employers to raise aspirations\r\n- children attend conference on inclusion, considering what 'inclusion' and exclusion mean and how schools can reflect or influence their community\r\n-children use webinars to share findings on situation regarding employment of workers from other countries\r\n- Professionals from all schools will formally evaluate the project and will also talk at a conference of UK schools to share pedagogies\r\n\r\nAcross 7 schools we hope to involve all our staff, either directly (through research. visits, presentations) or indirectly through the wider rippling effects which we know are experienced. This means that in excess of 300 professionals will be involved. In the same way we anticipate involvement from hundreds of children first hand and thousands in  a knock on effect.\r\nWe are more than confident that through our project, thousands of children, adults, families and stakeholders have broadened horizons and a wider view of their place within the European Union.", "http://www.valleyviewschool-pri.org.uk", "Valley View Community Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA201-000093_coordinator"], ["1DD", "Improving (internationally) the delivery of mathematics", "Valley View Community Primary School", 163507.0, "Context:\r\nAs a group of schools from seven countries, who have worked together on previous Erasmus+ projects, we come together in this project with a very clear idea of what we already know about our schools and where the common ground  is for further development . In this new three-year project we have all identified weaknesses in mathematics and have looked at the strength which we can all contribute so that through effective sharing of good practice, and through innovative approaches we can improve the outcomes in teaching and learning of mathematics for all our children.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nTo identify and address barriers to learning mathematics common to many children\r\nTo identify and support those children who have particular vulnerability especially in terms of their acquisition of mathematics skills\r\nTo explore and improve the impact of attitude on the ways children learn and how they achieve in mathematics\r\nTo learn and apply new approaches to the teaching of mathematics using the skills of academic tutors from across Europe as well as using best practice from across our schools\r\nTo ensure all children are benefiting equally from an inclusive and relevant mathematics curriculum\r\nTo devise a European Classroom approach to the teaching of mathematics and to ensure that this is incorporated into the long term curriculum for all our schools (and in a wider educational context) \r\nTo ensure that our curriculum for mathematics is as relevant and meaningful as possible, including being as appropriate as possible to the needs of employers across Europe\r\nTo incorporate relevant and innovative digital tools into the mathematics curriculum, in order to engage learners and to prepare the for future 'real life' contexts.\r\nTo provide better opportunities for staff to listen to children about their learning and their curriculum, and to ensure that this leads to the necessary modifications and changes.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\nThe project brings together:\r\n- a small rural school in Poland\r\n- a large rural school in Latvia\r\n- a larger than average urban school in England\r\n- a community of three very small schools in villages in Spain\r\n- a school facing challenging demographics in Bulgaria\r\n- a school in Northern Sweden with a changing population\r\n- a large primary school in Czech Republic in an area of high unemployment\r\nFrom each of these schools we will focus on a small group of teaching staff who will improve the skills they use when delivering mathematics to 10 and 11 year old children. \r\n\r\nActivities:\r\nAcross the three years, we will be taking part in six shared training events, which will all include specialist training in an area of expertise relating to the objectives. These areas of focus have been chosen because they affect all six countries and because we have partners who can take a lead on each one.\r\nBulgaria- main focuses are historical context of the curriculum, use of webinars and use of competitiveness in mathematics\r\nUK - main focus is developing use of 'Growth Mindset' especially within mathematics and to address gender inequalities\r\nLatvia- main focus is relevance of mathematics to future employment\r\nPoland - main focus will be taking account of children's views in making curriculum changes \r\nSpain - main focus will be using ICT to enhance mathematics and engage all learners\r\nSweden - then main focus here will be addressing the needs of all children particularly those from disadvantaged of vulnerable backgrounds\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\nFor each of the six identified focus areas, we will follow the same pattern to develop teachers' skills. We will use the 'train: plan: deliver: share: evaluate: embed' cycle. This means that we will provide specialist input on the specific focus area, alongside observations and comparisons of existing practice in all our countries. Then we will plan jointly for a shared teaching sequence to be delivered by the 'expert' country. These webinars lesson sequences will be experienced by children in all seven countries simultaneously. Following on from this we will upload work outputs from these lesson sequences so that all professionals involved can compare learning styles, pedagogy and barriers to understanding. Teachers will then evaluate their own practice and analyse the impact of the innovation before deciding on the most appropriate ways to embed this learning and to share with others in school and beyond.\r\n\r\nExpected Results, Impact and Longer Term Benefits:\r\nWe hope that the results and impact will be as follows:\r\n- improved attainment in mathematics\r\n- improved resilience in mathematics and other subjects\r\n- closing the gap between the achievement of children from different disadvantaged and vulnerable groups\r\n- narrowing the gaps in achievement between girls and boys\r\n- opening up opportunities for sharing of good practices\r\n- evaluation by teachers of a relevant mathematics curriculum for their context\r\n- improved skills in teachers to deliver mathematics\r\n- improved use of competitive spirit to engage learners", "http://www.valleyviewschool-pri.org.uk", "Valley View Community Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036590_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["3JT", "Leeds West CLLD", "Barca-Leeds", "West Leeds CLLD will:\n\u2022 Consult with local people\n\u2022 consult with the statutory, voluntary and business sectors to understand their needs and issues \nWe will establish an effective Local Action Group that will provide a funding and coordination function fo", "ERDF", 4404.0, 7842.0, "erdf_england_354"], ["3JT", "Leeds West CLLD", "Barca-Leeds", "The project will focus upon the Inner-West areas of Leeds within the areas of highest deprivation.
