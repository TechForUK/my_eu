The studies and work are devided in the fields of child and youthcare as well as remedial education care. At the  time of the vocational training period the students are in their 2nd year at the department of the professional training college , respectively in their 3rd year at the department of the professional grammar school (doubble  qualification as an educator with with highschool diploma).The training at the professional college takes 3 years.\r\nThe study topics are as following:\r\n1) infant pedagogics (below age 3)\r\n2) intergration / inclusion\r\n3) youth welfare/ schoolchildren\r\n4) residential provision / home\r\n\r\n\r\nAims\r\nThe aims are the development of cross-cultural key competences during the professional training of educators. Acting and practising strategies in the respective workfields shall be applied and modified according to the concepts of  the foreign institutions, that means in particular the different techniques and methods of the various European educational systems. This process aims to strengthen self-competence, social competence, professional and methodical competences of the students. An important effect is the experience of mobility and the acces to European educational institutions and jobs.\r\nThe aims and concepts are prepared, coached and evaluated in co-operation between  Erzbisch\u00f6fliches Berufskolleg and the partner institutions.\r\n\r\nActivities\r\nDuring the next 2 years about 60 students shall have the opportunity to participate in a 2 -, 4- or 6-weeks stay in one of our partner institutions in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Malta, Poland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.\r\nThe preparation develops during the complete schoolyear ( every 2nd week, 2 saturday workshops, 1 weekend workshop in a youth hostel - focussed on adventure /outdoor pursuits) and comprehends the presentation and information about the EU- programme lead by the responsible teachers of the EU-Team including special exercises for sensitzing cross-cultural understanding. Information about the different countries and their educational system is given by the students.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe benfits of the Europe Mobility are various. The students gain professional competences and by enlarging the awareness of different qualities of different nations,  become open minded which then enables them to find jobs abroad. The teachers of our school  are involved in networking as they visit our students in their institutions.Thus they  gain experience and strengthen their competences  for their own work. The public image of the college attracts possible applicants who understand the European idea. Workshops and an  annual meeting with our European partners at our college unite students, teachers and foreign collegues.", "http://www.securehomes.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE02-KA102-000374_6"]]}}, "2XE": {"esif": {"data": [[1475280000000, 1569801600000, "Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Growth & Efficiency-(GL-LEGE) Programme", "South Holland Council", "The proposed programme is an innovative package of grant-based support centred on the administration and distribution of capital grants as a catalyst for investment by SMEs.

As areas become stressed due to water exploitation or environmental pressures, the amount of water resources available for use have been decreasing (World Meteorological Organisation, 1999) and Europe has not been able to avoid these pressures. It is crucial to protect and improve water consumption to provide a sustainable practice for economic development and to maintain human settlements. LOWTEV will bring considerable water savings to the food industry which is comprised of over 230,000 SME organisations. With an excellent consortium with experts in the fields of food science and sanitisation we will develop a low water pressure ultrasound device integrated with an automated rapid hygiene monitoring system. By providing an alternative system for cleaning in place technology on bulk handling equipment for food processors, a factory site would benefit from at least a 10% savings in overall water use. This equates to an estimated \u20ac30,000 worth of savings on water and energy bills per factory, providing a return on investment in under 1 year of installation. The food industry sector within Europe lag behind in terms of innovation and R &amp;D investment; this project will address the environmental issues to improve water resources and will also improve the competitiveness of the SME food processing and bulk handling communities.

Such high cost has burdened the industry greatly, and SMEs are particularly vulnerable to further increase of landfill tax.

In particular, the wood coatings sector is facing a number of threats. The sector is coming under increasing pressure from low cost imports from Asia that have low solids content and subsequently poor durability. There is a need in Europe to maximise the use of timber as a sustainable resource within the built environment. For coated components including windows, doors and cladding this requires maximising service life and minimising maintenance costs. Wood coatings have themselves undergone considerable change in response to environmental and other legislation and require substantial testing to establish or predict service life across different wood species and climatic zones. The pace of development and potential long life of modern coatings means that real life durability data will not be available when new products are brought to the market place and this creates a risk which affects SME joinery manufacturers and applicators. Ultimately it will also affect the downstream customer and consumers who in the absence of credible guarantees may use less sustainable substrates for components, such as uPVC or Aluminium. A response to this problem has been the emergence of national and institution certification schemes. However these can effectively amount to barriers to trade between countries and do not rigorously address the issue of service life prediction. The SERVOWOOD project will address this issue by developing a service life prediction methodology which can be incorporated into the portfolio of European Standards for exterior wood coatings. To this end the project brings together experts on wood coatings from the relevant European Standards Committee with representatives from trade associations and others in the supply chain.", 203295.0, 2881570.0, 10, 15, "SERVOWOOD", null, "http://www.georgebarnsdale.co.uk", null, "fp7_111562_951950435"]]}}, "4TF": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Organising innovative teaching for collaboration, creative learning and motivated learners", "The Thomas Cowley High School", 9724.0, 1, 1, "As a rural secondary school in Lincolnshire, UK, we often struggle to offer our students innovative educational learning opportunities. Our students can become unmotivated and lack creativity. Through the educational setup of the 11+ exam and use of grammar schools in our county, students who come to us have already failed at something and this can add to their lack of motivation. Due to our location, students can also be closed off to other cultures.

Through this, we will be able to develop a team of innovation advocates who guide staff to raise the attainment of all students, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds. We wish to develop a vision of innovation in our school. In-school training will be organised through benchmarking and implementing the good practices of other countries. We will make advances in the interdisciplinary approach that we have to teaching and learning, to ensure that all students will achieve a qualification in literacy and numeracy.
