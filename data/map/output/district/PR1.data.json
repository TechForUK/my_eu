The portal provides activities to users that increase their meta-linguistic awareness about the bi- and multilingual use of sign languages. Specifically, we will exploit research data and analyses by translating them into a resource with educational units that support upskilling of deaf people in order to communicate remotely with signers of other sign languages. The MULTSIGN project had demonstrated that sign language users have a unique enhanced potential, compared to spoken languages, to communicate across language boundaries, and the project will enable signers to exploit this potential. The portal also provides a service for setting up flexibly adaptable bi- and multilingual online work spaces for transnational groups of sign language users, with an integrated tool for sign-to-sign-translation between different sign languages. This will enable disadvantaged deaf communities, who are largely isolated from international contact, to access developments and resources already available elsewhere among international deaf communities but not linguistically accessible. The project is a collaboration between an academic partner, the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) in the UK and a private company with special expertise in the relevant area, Dolphio Technologies, in Hungary.

The new philosophy changes the understanding of the teacher\u2019s role in relation to the child.  The teacher takes the role of \u201cthe one learning from the child\u201d, aiming to support the child in their development and learning process by involving them in decisions based on their current capabilities.

The faculty will learn from their peers and bring back impulse to improve faculty development.  Both activities will be linked closely to obtain the best possible results. This project goal is in line with the RvW-BK European partnership work.\r\nIn the discipline of business administration and economics, the focus is on \u201cwork-life-balance\u201d (WLB) and how one attains this while participating in career, family and social activities.  The participants will study existing work-time models and develop recommendations based on their findings.  The study will have the following elements:  interviews of peers and supervisors with the aid of questionnaires; discussions with supervisors about economic and demographic challenges in their host country; analysis of the differences in WLB expectations by age group and with reference to the various work-time models and comparison of their findings in the host country to those of students who did their work placements in Germany.\r\nThe faculty members of the technical departments will focus on interactive teaching structures at the partnering facilities, preferably with heterogeneous learning groups that are aiming to improve and  self-learning.\r\nThe close linkage between student placement and faculty visits guarantees the quality of the project.

The consortium wishes to offer work placements in European companies for VET learners that experience difficulties in entering the job market, and also short job-shadowing/observation periods for the staff of the consortium members.Within the project, mobility activities are planned for 3 different groups of beneficiaries:- 80 grants for work 8-week work placements in European companies (Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, United Kingdom), for continuing VET learners, not preparing for a diploma (\u201cgroup 1\u201d). These people encounter difficulties in entering the labour market and in managing their transition to working life. They are monitored by counsellors at P\u00f4le Emploi or \u201cMissions locales\u201d (members of the consortium);- 20 grants for work 4-week work placements in European companies (Italy, United Kingdom) for continuing VET learners, enrolled in a regional training programme preparing beneficiaries for entering skills training or employment (\u201cgroup 2\u201d). These people are in the process of professional reintegration after several months of unemployment. They have identified a professional project, but are weakened by the lack of transversal skills. An accompanying person will travel with each flow in order to help the trainees to settle in. 4 grants are needed for accompanying persons;- 10 grants for 3-day job-shadowing/observation periods (Finland, Poland, Spain), for staff of the consortium member organisations (\u201cgroup 3\u201d). They promote mobility and need to live a mobility experience themselves and to open up towards a European dimension.After an open call for tenders, AFORMAC was chosen by the Regional Council to assist in the implementation of the project for the beneficiaries of groups 1 and 2.The main objectives for the VET learners (groups 1 and 2) are:1\u00b0 behaviour: motivation, autonomy, self-reliance, communication, social skills, mobility2\u00b0 professional: professional skills and competence, new professional techniques and practice, better knowledge of the world of enterprise;3\u00b0 linguistic and cross-cultural: practising a foreign language, discovering another European language, realising one's European citizenship, growing aware of one's own culture.Transversal skills - necessary for one's personal, social and professional fulfilment - are in the centre of the project for these two groups of VET learners, and this even prior to gaining professional skills as such.The main objectives for the staff mobilities (group 3) are:- development of professional skills;- better understanding of the stakes of European mobility;- improving linguistic and cross-cultural skills;- making the European area one's own and realising fully one's European citizenship.Expected outcomes for the VET learners include:- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills- re-establishing one's personal and professional project- increased employability- renewed interest in learning- more active citizen involvement- better capacity for geographical mobility on all levels: regional, national, European, or even international- quicker access to better employment or to skills training/a diploma courseEnvisaged results for staff are:- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills;- stronger interest for European mobility;- better understanding and anticipation of the Europe 2020 targets for life-long learning;- increased sense of belonging to Europe.Finally, the potential longer term benefits of the project include : - pursuing the regional dynamic created amongst the members of the consortium of AUDACE mobility projects;- training of better quality for continuous VET trainees in Auvergne;- internationalisation of employment/training support structures;- more international activity both in sending and receiving regions;- a wider perspective on one's professional practice thanks to exchange;- bringing VET centres and businesses closer together, thus enhancing the active role they can play in the issues of unemployment of young Europeans;- European cooperation on other innovating projects.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA102-014842_2"], ["8RJ", "Leren om verstandig en duurzaam te veranderen", "Lancashire County Council", 16657.0, "CVO Lethas Brussels has to implement quiet a lot of changes in the nearby future.

This objective is above all suited to our department, the second tourist focal point that welcomes about half the British people who visit France. All the training associated with Erasmus+ (working with people, the hotel trade, tourism, cat and dog breeding, management of equestrian centres) encourages and leads students to learn to adapt to meet client\u2019s needs. Students at MFR and CFO often choose this style of training as an alternative to others on offer, 50% of their time is spent working in a business and 50% of their time is spent at college. Present times are difficult because they involve people who have travelled a little, who are quite self-sufficient and who are not too curious. These young people who have not travelled a lot need to be encouraged to branch out into new work experiences outside of France.To respond to these needs we have developed a plan involving training and work experience in Belgium and in Great Britain for 100 young people 4 from MFR and 20 adults currently training at CFP. They go for three weeks, two weeks for the CAPA students who are a little younger, less self sufficient and do their work experience in a business related to their studies.The offer of education and training via the Erasmus + in England is also available to members of the teaching profession.

It emphasises the need to master the English language. It also provides a better understanding of the role of a European citizen and of finding a place in the European job market.The impact on staff will be in a broadening of their teaching and training methods and skills.

ADICE considers the mobility experience as a tool allowing the development of technical, transverse and social skills which favors employment. The project \u201cMOVE IT: Mobility Opportunities for Vocational Educational and International Training\u201d plans for two years, from the 1st of June 2016, the sending of 40 learners in vocational training, in mobility for purposes of learning, in the eligible countries of the European Union, planned in our partnership agreement: in United Kingdom, in Malta, in Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Germany, Spain, Poland, Romania and Greece. These mobility projects will be characterized by professional internships in companies or within non for profit organizations, and would last for 3, 6 or 10 months.These placements will be organized and defined according to the experience, sector of activity, professional project, needs, expectations at short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goal is to promote the European mobility, but also to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person.  Applications are thus estimated with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. At the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures who organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.Our partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Poland, the United Kingdom, etc.) a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end.  The diversity of the partners allows us to answer the majority of the candidates\u2019 needs. Thus, our international strategy aims to offer internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.Regarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Nord-Pas-De-Calais area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is largely exceeding the national rate (12.8%, while 10.0% in metropolitan France, especially for Young people aged from 15 to 24 years old, with a 23.6% unemployment rate, data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2015). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 22% of the local population. With mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-FR01-KA116-023570_15"], ["6UY", "Un levier pour l'emploi IV", "UK Work Placement", 1120938.0, "P\u00f4le emploi wants to carry an Erasmus+ project for the 2017-2019 period in order to offer to jobseekers a European mobility opportunity.

This seminar is in line with the goals of the Erasmus + program and more precisely those of the action KA1 \"Mobility of the youth actors\", in fact:\r\n\r\n1) target participants are or have been active actors in the field of youth\r\n2) the aim of this type of Erasmus + project echoes the purpose of the seminar, namely the professional development of the actors,\r\n3)share the objectives of Erasmus +: encouraging interaction between actors, strengthening European cooperation, discovering youth work.\r\n\r\nThe need identified is to promote the hosting within the structures that have never yet seized this opportunity; the seminar also wants to meet the needs of the partners leader in the hosting projects. Indeed, the activities planned will allow them to reflect on the causes of certain difficulties encountered in hosting projects and to revitalize practices already acquired by setting up a hosting protocol for beneficiaries with specific needs or less opportunity. The objectives of this meeting will therefore be:\r\n\r\n- to strengthen European cooperation\r\n- to discover/ improve youth work in an intercultural context\r\n- to exchange around professional practices\r\n- to develop common working methods for future partnerships / projects\r\n- to increase and support projects aimed at hosting young people and / or professionals\r\n\r\nThe activities planned for the development of the identified objectives will be group workshops aiming to analyze the hosting process in all the key stages in order to facilitate the access to the projects and thus to promote more this program.\r\n\r\nThis project will positively influence the direct and indirect beneficiaries as it responds concretely to the needs identified during its conception. The meeting will provide specific responses through the development of ad hoc activities to achieve the objectives. In the short term, the participants will be able both to acquire skills in hosting projects and to renew the dynamics already acquired. In the long term, we believe that with this exchange, the European partners present will be able to design a new approach to mobility and hospitality projects, taking into account the social and political context of present and future Europe. Regarding the management of the project, we wish to keep a very collaborative and transparent management of any decision and follow-up of the quality of the seminar. We will put in place an \"open method of coordination, to share data, online meetings, information / advice at a distance.\" During the three days convention, the partners will have their own place for the animation and moderation of the debates. Methodology will also be deployed in the final evaluation phase of the project, dissemination of results and promotion of the pocket-book of good hosting. Mobility will be assessed using formal and non-formal tools and participants will reflect on their learning during the first phase and on their personal expectations. During this stage, SWOT analysis will be again the point of departure in order to identify if the difficulties, opportunities or weaknesses of each organization have been well treated and solved. At the end of the Europe 202 program 0, it would be worth considering bringing together all the participants reunited again to follow-up to the seminar and to adapt the hosting protocol pocket-book to the new needs and challenges identified in the context post Europe 2020.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-2-FR02-KA105-013410_3"], ["5BB", "Signed Voices", "Deafway", 44239.0, "Signed Voices is a youth exchange project which aims to promote cultural and social inclusion for Deaf young people, and intercultural awareness and understanding between Deaf and hearing people, and between different European countries. This is a non-formal education project using heritage investigation through film as the medium to motivate and develop the skills and self-confidence of young Deaf people.\r\n\r\nThe majority of hearing societies across the EU (indeed across the world) fail to truly recognise Deaf people who use sign language as a first or preferred language positively as a cultural and linguistic minority group.  Deaf people face barriers in accessing many services and activities which hearing people access freely without barriers.\r\n\r\nDeaf people, their sign languages and their culture have a great deal to offer - not only to Deaf people, but also to hearing people and society. There is strength, pride, encouragement and enhanced positive self esteem to be had from meeting, working with and developing friendships with Deaf young people from other parts of the EU.  Learning about the lives of other EU citizens who are Deaf contributes to a greater sense of being European.\r\n\r\nThis application is based on our ongoing \"Signed Voices\" heritage project in the NW of England, which is all about capturing the Deaf Community\u2019s memories, experiences and contemporary values; showcasing them now, and preserving them for future generations. Exploring our own and others' heritage is a gateway to pride, respect and identity. Yet, most people do not know what \u201cDeaf Heritage\u201d means and are unaware that British Sign Language (BSL) is a complex language with its own grammar and art forms. Deaf people who use BSL have their own cultural and linguistic heritage. However, they have fewer opportunities than other native language groups in the UK to consider heritage.\r\n\r\nSigned Voices is an \u2018oral history project\u2019 with BSL at its core. It enables members of the Deaf Community to share their heritage with a wider community and creates a lasting legacy. Deafway works with Deaf volunteers to film memories and contemporary thoughts, in short semi-structured interviews \u2013 conducted in BSL by pairs of young people who decide their own interview topic. This culminates in a live celebration and reflection event and a final exhibition which will be available to tour.\r\n\r\nThis Erasmus+ project will extend the methodology, results and impact of Signed Voices to four other European countries (Estonia, Poland, Greece and Netherlands) while also helping us to extend the project within the UK. The project will address the fact that there continues to be a dearth of opportunity for Deaf and hearing people to engage with Deaf heritage and to embrace feelings of pride and identity in relation to each country's Deaf heritage. We believe this will bring a new (or at least rarely seen) dimension to the Erasmus+ programme, with excellent prospects for visibility and dissemination.\r\n\r\n20 Deaf young people from 5 countries (Estonia, Greece, Italy, Poland and UK) will take part in this project. in Preston, UK in summer 2018. All will be sign language users and different sign languages (principally BSL and international sign) will be the principal medium of communication on the project. The methods used will be exclusively non-formal education (interactive, team based) with a strong intercultural learning element.\r\n\r\nThe impact we are looking for is a model of good practice in intercultural communication between and beyond different Sign Language user communities, developed through Erasmus+. We hope the approaches developed by this project will be recognised and promoted by and through National Agencies. We are willing to share the methodology of this project with other organisations and networks around Europe.

Our expertise  through all these projects has been strengthened over the years and we have developped high quality tools (mobility passport, skills booklet...) to support better all participants in their project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of ADICE, and of the project, is to ensure the social and professional development of the learners (including those with fewer opportunities), by participating in a valuable mobility experience. ADICE considers the mobility experience as a tool allowing the development of technical, transverse and social skills which favors employment. \r\n\r\nThe project \u201cLUCIE: Learning Unique Competencies In Europe\u201d plans for two years, from the 1st of June 2017, the sending of 30 learners in vocational training, in mobility for purposes of learning, in the eligible countries of the European Union, planned in our partnership agreement: in United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Germany, Spain and Czech Republic. These mobility projects will be characterized by professional internships in companies or within non for profit organizations, and would last for 3, 6 or 10 months.\r\n\r\nThese placements will be organized and defined according to the experience, sector of activity, professional project, needs, expectations at short and long term and the profile of the participants. Indeed, ADICE\u2019s goal is to promote the European mobility, but also to fight against discriminations and to promote people with fewer opportunities at a social and professional level. Our public is diverse and so, our projects are, first of all, accessible to all local learners, without any discrimination, yet no level of studies is required or limited age, and also, characterized by destinations, durations, and various sectors of activity. They are fitted to the needs, objectives and profile of each person. Participants are supported with regard to all these criteria and on the motivation and relevance of the participant\u2019s personal and professional project. \r\n\r\nAt the level of the European partners, we work on one hand with intermediate structures which organize the mobility of the participants, and, thus, provide a support to the participants with more difficulties, and on the other hand, we work also more and more directly with host structures and companies. These structures are found, during the whole contract period, and especially selected for the mobility of a participant in specific areas. They also may have already hosted participant within their structure in past projects.\r\nOur partnership network is related to our internalization strategy. It is characterized by a geographical, linguistic and economic diversity a plurality of activities sectors adapted to every public (social, tourism, sale, communication, etc.) and of types of structures (companies, associations, training centers\u2026) Every partner, whether it is a direct structure or intermediate structure, is in charge of providing a quality placement (within its structure or one of its local partners), if possible the accommodation, and a support if the participant is facing difficulties (in the activities, with the team, social or cultural difficulties, or a problem linked to the security of the participant). Indeed, the partner has to provide a quality follow-up during the mobility, and a relevant and fitted evaluation at the end. The diversity of the partners allows us to offer a large panel of relevant opportunities to the participants\u2019 needs and careers. Thus, our international strategy aims at offering internships in companies as well as in associations, in a varied number of professional sectors and in a diversity of countries.\r\n\r\nRegarding the development at the European level, ADICE being a territorial actor of social and professional inclusion, our action plan is in complete relevance with the analysis of the needs at the territorial and sectorial level, but also for the public. Indeed, the Hauts-de-France area is very affected by unemployment, which rate is higher than other area and largely exceeding the national rate (12%, while 9.6% in metropolitan France data given by INSEE for the 2nd trimester 2016). Moreover, the city of Roubaix knows a high economic development, but the rate of unemployment stays high and affects 30.9% of the local population. \r\nWith mobility experience being an entrance to employment, it enables the development of new experiences, skills and opportunities to enrich the professional life, the project of ADICE is thus absolutely relevant at a local level, according to the territory priorities and background. Moreover, a project like this one, allows the development of the territory at a European level, the enlargement of the opportunities and network and the exchange and developpement of new skills among this local network, which is a real added value for our structure but also for the territory.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA116-035846_10"], ["6UY", "AUDACE+2", "UK Work Placement", 141272.0, "\u201cAUDACE+2\u201d is a mobility project led by a consortium, coordinated by the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Regional Council, the sending partners being P\u00f4le Emploi Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and the 14 \u201cMissions Locales\u201d of the Auvergne. The consortium wishes to offer work placements in European companies for VET learners that experience difficulties in entering the job market.\r\n\r\nWithin the project, the consortium wishes to send 80 beneficiaries for 8-week work placements in European companies (Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom). The beneficiaries are continuing VET learners who are not preparing for a diploma. These people encounter difficulties in entering the labour market and in managing their transition to working life. They are monitored by counsellors at P\u00f4le Emploi Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes and \u201cMissions locales\u201d (members of the consortium).\r\n\r\nThe main objectives for the VET learners are:\r\n1\u00b0 behaviour: motivation, autonomy, self-reliance, communication, social skills, mobility\r\n2\u00b0 professional: professional skills and competence, new professional techniques and practice, better knowledge of the world of enterprise;\r\n3\u00b0 linguistic and cross-cultural: practising a foreign language, discovering another European language, realising one's European citizenship, growing aware of one's own culture.\r\n\r\nTransversal skills - necessary for one's personal, social and professional fulfilment - are in the centre of the project for these two groups of VET learners, and this even prior to gaining professional skills as such. A pedagogical, linguistic and cultural preparation will take place before the mobility and there are language classes during the mobility period.\r\n\r\nAfter an open call for tenders, AFORMAC was chosen by the Regional Council to assist in the implementation of the project.\r\n\r\nThe 80 learners will leave in 6 groups of 14 people in average, in 3 different destinations among the following countries: Ireland, Italy, the UK, Portugal, Lithuania, Spain or Slovenia. The departures will take place every 3 months (except during the summer months).\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes for the VET learners include:\r\n- gaining professional, linguistic, cross-cultural and transversal skills;\r\n- re-establishing one's personal and professional project;\r\n- increased employability;\r\n- renewed interest in learning;\r\n- more active citizen involvement;\r\n- better capacity for geographical mobility on all levels: regional, national, European, or even international;\r\n- quicker access to better employment or to skills training/a diploma course.\r\n\r\nAll beneficiaries will receive a Europass Mobility on their return to certify the achieved learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nFinally, the potential longer term benefits of the project include:\r\n- pursuing the regional dynamic created amongst the members of the consortium of AUDACE mobility projects;\r\n- training of better quality for continuous VET trainees in Auvergne;\r\n- internationalisation of employment/training support structures;\r\n- more international activity both in sending and receiving regions.\r\n\r\nThe results will be disseminated through:\r\n- Europass awarding ceremonies in the presence of regional councillors and local press;\r\n- forums for international mobility, forums on employment, etc.;\r\n- articles in local newspapers;\r\n- presentations in reunions;\r\n- the newsletter of the \u00ab Auvergne Network for International Mobility \u00bb, the IODA network of the CARIF-OREF, social networks (\u201cAuvergne Mobilit\u00e9 Internationale\u201d on Facebook, Twitter).\r\n\r\nEvolution in the \u201cAUDACE+2\u201d project (2017-2019) in comparison to \u201cAUDACE+\u201d project (2015-2017): On 1st January 2016, the Auvergne Region and the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Region merged to form the new Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Region.

They can work in trade and industry, gain experience in dealing with customers, learn to work in a team, translate documents and much more. The school works closely together with agencies in each country. Learning targets are set out and the students are supervised by mentors: they have to complete a learning diary and have regular meetings with the mentors.\r\nThis project aims to sharpen the students\u2019 understanding that taking part in a European internship not only improves their language proficiency but also enhances other skills.

A further, long-term effect that is not to be underestimated is the improvement of teaching, as the experiences the participants have had are evaluated by the teachers and are integrated into their lessons. In this way, the quality of our training is always under scrutiny and is continually being optimised. The mobility of teachers who visit companies and the agencies we work with to observe the working practices there also contributes towards improving the teaching quality at our school.

European trained players are increasingly entering English/Welsh Senior teams instead of homegrown and very few English or Welsh players go into mainland Europe to play\r\n3. Of the top 100 training clubs (those producing players performing in the top European Leagues) only 3 are English and 0 are Welsh (CIES data) - Holland, Spain and France have the most representatives \r\n4.

Expose players/coaches to the philosophies and training environments which are producing players in Europe who are migrating to England/Wales \r\n2. Enable players/coaches to observe, experience, evaluate, improve and acquire new technical, tactical & physical skills/training techniques  \r\n3. Facilitate Personal/Professional Development of players/coaches and the acquisition of greater self-knowledge, new behaviours and attitudes, cultural awareness, employability and language skills\r\n4. Expand player/coach knowledge of labour market opportunities inside and outside of performance within Europe and encourage outward migration\r\n5. Challenge players/coaches to take responsibility for embedding acquired knowledge and learning in to their everyday environments and programmes\r\n6. Effect structural changes at the governing body level (Premier League/Football League/FA) and within the Apprenticeship framework based on European best practice\r\n      \r\nIn order to create learning and development opportunities for the above objectives the following activities are proposed:\r\n\r\n1. Two week training programme for 14 professional youth teams in Holland/Spain. \r\nApprentice players are aged 16-18 and undertaking the Apprenticeship in Sporting Excellence (ASE) programme. \r\nThis would give 280 apprentices an opportunity to learn and develop. \r\n\r\n2. Twelve week placement programme for 30 recent graduates of ASE NOT offered professional terms at their club upon completion of the programme to Sweden/Spain\r\n\r\n3.

To help the students attain this goal, we have devised two mobility \u201croad-maps\u201d: the first lasting 8 weeks, particularly geared to young people in integration with an educational level from V to II, the second of 12 weeks targeted at participants of a higher level, either older or with longer professional experience.

Thus, 44 mobilities, divided into 5 flows, will take place in English-speaking countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, Cyprus. JEEME is also aimed at young people between 18 and 25 years old who have migrant backgrounds, with few opportunities and little knowledge of French, for which we have declined a mobility flow in Brussels.\r\nThere are numerous results expected by the members of the Consortium:\r\n\r\n- Inscribe the sustainability of the project at a territorial level and broaden the Consortium's partnership basis by promoting the internationalisation of other organisations working in the fields of employment support, education and training.\r\n\r\n- Promoting mobility initiatives as a qualification and employability tool for people in integration and contribute to the development and certification of the knowledge acquired during the mobility period from employment professionals and companies.\r\n\r\n- Raise awareness among prescribing public authorities to include dedicated budget lines in complementary calls to the Erasmus + programme in order to multiply internship opportunities for internships for people in integration.", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047512_1"], ["6UY", "Mobilno\u015b\u0107 uczni\u00f3w i nauczycieli \"Ekonoma\" gwarancj\u0105 sukcesu zawodowego", "UK Work Placement", 131348.0, "The promoter of the project is Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Ekonomiczno-Us\u0142ugowych [ZSE-U] in Byt\u00f3w.

They are the third grade students of Technical Secondary School Complex (ZSTiO) of the following professions: IT Technician, Mechatronics Technician, Economic Technician, Renewable Energy Systems and Devices Technician.\r\nInternships will be held during the years 2018, 2019 and 2020, in Spanish companies dealing with IT industry, especially computer graphics, web design, computer network administration and programming; Renewable Energy Systems and Devices Industry (photovoltaic panels and solar collectors); in British companies \u2013Mechatronics Industry  (automotive mechatronics, production lines, control systems) and Economics (company management, accountancy). There are many foreign companies participating in this project. A great number of them have already been cooperating with ZSTiO in other European programmes such as Erasmus+, Leonardo da Vinci and EFS POKL.\r\nThe main reason why students and graduates will go for apprenticeship training abroad, is their professional development, understanding the issues commonly faced by foreign based companies commencing operations in a field that relates to the students degree, a comparison of working methods in Poland with those applied in other European countries, gaining international team-work experience and getting to know different solutions in the previously mentioned industries. In addition, there is also a need to improve students\u2019 language skills (professional English) and the recognition of other cultures in different European countries (including work and organizational culture).\r\nThe main purpose of this project is to meet our students and graduates\u2019 needs as mentioned above. Moreover, the aim of the project is to draw the attention to improve European mobility in vocational education and training, improvement in cooperation within educational facilities and institutions, to facilitate the improvement of vocational training and internships, the improvement of transparency and the formal recognition of vocational qualifications, supporting information technology as well as the improvement of European dimension.\r\nExpected outcomes result from the needs and objectives of the project.

The proposal is part of the already launched and consolidated process of internationalization that sees the Institutes involved in many projects in cooperation with other schools or public and private organizations, aimed at fostering the European dimension of formal and non-formal learning for an employment policy addressed to the international context.\r\nThe project originates from an analysis of the training needs expressed by the Veneto manufacturing sector in relation to the introduction and progressive affirmation within the production processes and to the organization of work of changes related to Smart Manfacturing.\r\nTo fully exploit the potentials related to the enhancement of the local territory, the Consortium members need to support a new development cycle based on the principles of competitiveness, technological innovation and quality that can only be successful with adoption of a strategy focused on an international vision of the didactic-training actions.\r\nThe project therefore intends to offer an answer to the increasingly urgent challenges that affect the regional territory:\r\n- increasing the technical and professional skills of the new professional profiles required in the Smart Specialization sectors\r\n- contributing to the employability of young people by offering training experiences to develop communication skills in foreign languages and interpersonal skills in multicultural contexts.\r\nThe above is consistent with the Research and Innovation Strategy for the Smart Specialization of the Veneto Region which promotes the development of human resources and their international mobility also through the establishment of skills ecosystems.\r\nIn this perspective, the project aims to provide 131 students with the opportunity to undertake a 4-week period of training mobility abroad recognized as ASL (in line with the provisions of Law 107/15). Technical-technological (Mechanics / Mechatronics, Electronics, Informatics, Logistics) and economic (AFM, RIM and SIA) study curricula are involved and targets industrial profiles and related support services. The destinations in the UK, IE, FR, DE, ES and FI are confirmed and a new country and partner has been introduced in Poland, extending the opening to the East already started in 2016.\r\nThe mobility flows will be preceded by an intense phase of pedagogical and linguistic preparation. The language communication skills will be exercised both in curricular programs and through awareness-raising of the participants towards commitment and self-learning (through the use of the OLS), but alsowith strengthening activities within the educational offer.\r\nThe scouting activity will be carried out in collaboration with foreign partners in the different countries through the involvement of companies operating mainly in Smart Specialization fields belonging to the Consortium's already consolidated network and new companies intercepted also through the CCIAA network abroad. The Consortium will provide students with constant support during their stay. The high percentage of underage beneficiaries requires the involvement of carefully selected accompanying persons who will play a key role in facilitating the socio-cultural integration in the host country and supervision and monitoring of activities.\r\nThe project also envisages 7 mobilities in the UK addressed to the staff of the Consortium Institutes in order to offer not only a linguistic update, but also innovative didactic approaches tailored to the identified needs. The primary need is to have access to continuous training in the areas of new learning environments, networking, development of new teaching techniques and CLIL.\r\nAs outlined in the European Development Plans and in line with the 2016-2019 PTOF, the Consortium members intend to renew and reinforce their training offer in the direction of a European perspective, continuing to promote and implement international activities. The Erasmus + 2017-1-IT01-KA116-006044 project for 125 students and 6 teachers is currently being implemented. The commitment continues:\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of language training and certification courses in various languages (participation in the MOVE 5.0 projects financed by the ESF Veneto Region);\r\n- in the promotion of CLIL methodology and job shadowing activities abroad (ETwinning)\r\n- in the upgrading and improvement of hosting services\r\n- in the implementation of tools for the management of all phases of mobility\r\n- in the expansion of the offer of cultural exchanges and stays abroad also through the consolidation of European networks", "http://www.ukworkplacement.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006482_35"], ["6UY", "Carri\u00e8res Europ\u00e9ennes pour les Dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s R\u00e9cents de l'Enseignement Secondaire et Sup\u00e9rieur", "UK Work Placement", 290160.0, "The IERF, founded in 1995, an organisation providing training, career guidance and mobility accompaniment, proposes for consideration the renewal of the CEDRES.S project \u2013 \u201cEuropean Careers for Recent Graduates of Secondary and Higher Education\u201d, approved through simplified procedure since 2014.\r\nThis project aims at offering each year to 100 participants from the Ile de France region, mobility path that will enable them to professionalise themselves and enhance their employability. Based, since 2009, on certified methodologies born under the Leonardo da Vinci program, and then on the implementation of Erasmus+, our project CEDRES.S offered to more than 300 VET learners (young people aged 18-25 on their integration path, unemployed people changing career, young graduated) the opportunity to carry out a qualifying path in a European company. \r\nResults are convincing and on line with European studies: 3 to 6 months upon return, 65 % of the participants will be back to work and among them, 15% abroad. 15% will integrate a new training and 5% will decide to experience another mobility to enhance their qualification.  \r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year.
