It is a potentially important therapeutic target for several major cancers including breast, lung and colon, and has attracted major interest from pharmaceutical companies and clinicians. Currently, at least 70 clinical trials are underway to test several different IGF-IR kinase inhibitors and blocking antibodies. However, unlike some other growth factor receptors the IGF-IR is not amplified or over-expressed in cancer. One of the major challenges to targeting the IGF-IR in cancer is the lack of suitable biomarkers that will a) assess IGF-IR activity in tumours, b) facilitate selection of patients and subsets of tumours that are most likely to respond to inhibitors, and c) monitor responses to IGF-IR inhibition. This programme aims to address this problem by identifying and validating biomarkers for the IGF-IR signalling pathway in cancer. This programme involves a collaboration between researchers at University College Cork who are experts in IGF-I signalling and researchers at Almac Diagnostics who are experts in pharmacogenomic approaches to biomarker discovery in cancer. The research plan will take two complementary approaches: 1) explore the potential of a list of candidate genes that have already been identified in a screen for IGF-IR activity in cancer; and 2) carry out an unbiased genomic screen using a combination of cell models selected as models for IGF-I signalling and proprietary databases that have been collated from different sources, including patient data.

Ongoing work after the project end will determine the role of SAA as a driver of ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n\nAn important line of work in the MABSOT study entailed identification of novel early biomarkers of kidney damage. Microarray studies in a mouse renal transplant model identified 20 genes of significant interest that are differentially regulated within 6 hours post-transplant. Analysis of the qPCR and ELISA results confirmed two early biomarkers of kidney damage, SPP-1 and TIMP-1, for validation in human transplant samples.\n\nA phase I healthy volunteer clinical trial with OPN-305 has been completed, demonstrating the safety and tolerability of intravenous antibody administration.

As a result of the project internationally recognised and relevant curriculum will be developed and community coaches will receive high-quality training (including practical tools and techniques) about the instrumental role sport can play within their communities. The strategic partnership is formed by a variety of experts ISA, Oikos, Unify Solutions, University of Bedfordshire. Through different workshop and training settings the strategic partnership develops a curriculum for community sport coaches focusing on three themes: a) Sport & Life skills, b) Sport & Conflict management, c) Sport & Entrepreneurship. Curriculum will be developed both for the training of community sport leaders as well for the training of youth. Based on the developed curriculum three different trainings will be organized for 20 community sport coaches. Wherein each training will focus on a different theme. During the final phase of the project several multiplier events will be organised to disseminate the developed expertise and present the new curriculum. The most important result of the project is the development of curriculum that community sport coaches can use when organising structural activities for disadvantaged youth. Though a holistic approach the community sport coach should be better able to create a safe, inclusive and enabling environment wherein young people from disadvantaged youth can develop themselves optimally.", "http://www.unify-solutions.com", null, "erasmus_2015-3-NL02-KA205-001127_2"], ["5HS", "Green Clean Future", "Seagoe Primary School", 78997.0, "Green Clean Future (GCF) is a strategic partnership between four schools around Europe: The schools have come together to exchange good practice and develop new, innovative teaching methods to address sustainable development. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this educational and environmental project is to increase students\u2019 awareness concerning mankind\u2019s influence on climate change and their role in addressing this vital global challenge. The project is based firmly on the active participation of the students under the direction of their teachers in the understanding that this challenge requires transnational cooperation. The experience of working with their peers from other countries will enhance motivation and learning. The project provides opportunities for students to strengthen and enhance their skills in maths, literacy and science, in addition to their linguistic abilities. \r\n\r\nThe GCF project encourages teachers to share and learn from other teachers\u2019 experiences. This collaboration includes the development of innovative solutions on how to approach environmental phenomena using project based learning. We aim to harness the creativity of both pupils and teachers in order to drive our project forward. In addition, we hope to awaken interest in the topic so that participants will continue to \u201clive out\u201d the themes long after the project\u2019s conclusion. This may be through changes to their own lifestyle choices or their influence on significant others such as family and friends. \r\n\r\nSustainability is an integral part of the curriculum in each of the partner schools. There will be significant inter-  and intra-school collaboration that will have a positive effect on the culture of all the schools involved. \r\n\r\nThe project consists of four themes:  \r\n\r\nIntroduction and Climate Change Issues \r\nSustainable Travel and Food Waste \r\nPlastic Not So Fantastic \r\nMaking an Impact! (Sharing Best Practice) \r\n\r\nThe student populations of partner schools have become increasingly multicultural. The GCF activities are planned in order to support integration and cooperation between children of a wide variety of diverse backgrounds and cultures. This is a topic that should enthuse everyone. Our aim is to provide equal opportunities for every student and teacher to participate actively and for their voices to be heard and their opinions valued. To this end a number of user-friendly methods to communicate and share have been identified and developed at both student and teacher level. \r\n\r\nGCF increases awareness that we can all \u201cMake an Impact\u201d by taking small steps that lead to giant leaps. In other words, students will develop an understanding  that we all have the power to change the future of our planet if we work together with a common goal and that even small changes in our lifestyle choices can have a significant, positive  impact on the environment.", "http://www.seagoeps.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA219-034724_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT63"}
