The overarching theme is the development and dissemination of a common pedagogy based on the rapidly changing developments and requirements for ICT including computer programming and robotics. In response to developing economic and social needs of countries across the EU, elements of computer science have entered primary school programmes of work. These new curricula aim to provide a high quality education in the burgeoning field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), empowering pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world. Engagement with this new discipline ensures that pupils become digitally literate, i.e. able to use and express themselves and extend their ideas through ICT, to become competent for their future workplaces and as active participants in the digital world. Although in the near future, we can expect the first \u2018digitally native\u2019 teachers, the present situation is that there is a discernible gap in confidence and competence between current teachers and their pupils. This has created a challenge for the professional development of teachers and so the overarching aim of this project is to provide some resolution to issues of curriculum implementation in  the fields of information technology in general and robotics and programming more specifically. The project aims to support current teachers and influence the content of  initial teacher education, whilst at the same time making positive impact upon the developing interests and skills of pupils within the primary age range of 4 -11/12 years. These skills are based upon the \u20184Cs\u2019: Collaboration, Communication, Creativity and Critical thinking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide evidence for effective:\r\n\u2022 development of 20th Century teachers\u2019 professional knowledge for preparation and delivery of 21st Century skills in learning and ICT for pupils;\r\n\u2022 coverage of new elements of ICT curricular content in computer programming and robotics; \r\n\u2022 provision of  new subject and pedagogic knowledge to support the use of robotics and programming in the primary age range;\r\n\u2022 enhancement of programmes of study to produce age-relevant resources, schemes of work and skills progression;\r\n\u2022 exploration of  ways of combining and generating creativity with logic;\r\n\u2022 understanding from pupils\u2019 viewpoints of the purpose of learning these new skills;\r\n\u2022 development of both  independence and cooperative learning and teamwork: the 4Cs.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To develop and enhance primary school teachers\u2019 skills and understanding within the emerging field of robotics and programming.\r\n2. To enable primary school pupils to use and apply their acquired skills to become responsible, confident and creative users of ICT.\r\n3. To create appropriate pedagogy and detailed schemes of work, including continuity and progression for development of specific skills.\r\n4. To develop effective partnerships with the 'world of work' to contextualize the pedagogy/learning.\r\n5. To utilise and enhance the relevant European Key Competencies associated with this project e.g. Digital Competence, Learning to Learn, Communication in mother language and that of another country and to introduce the concept of entrepreneurialism.\r\n6. To explore and elaborate the cooperative, transnational nature of the project to develop the European dimension across all the participating schools, their pupils, parents and staff.\r\n7. To provide evidence for the impact of the outcomes of the project through dissemination to the teaching profession, school  parents/carers and governors, educational administrators and policy-makers across the participating countries and beyond.\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\nThere are 10 participant partners from a range of primary schools and adult education establishments  from the UK, Spain, Denmark Lithtunais and Malta. \r\nDescription of activities:\r\nExperiences and activities will offer different models of expression that will be disseminated through multiplier events and through models of good practice to be adapted to the needs of individual participants. Activities will include an exchange of good practice, curricula ideas and professional dialogue including the use of digital technologies.\r\nMethodology:\r\nThe project will use a blended approach to generating and developing best practice including case studies, action research, face to face meetings, training events and transnational project meetings.\r\nResults and long term benefits:\r\nIn addition to MEs and IPs, partnerships will be developed and strengthened with participant schools and adult education establishments, and multi-relational cooperation, there will be an open training course to continue the partnership and develop and update resources & innovation.", "http://www.standrewscofe.co.uk", "St. Andrew's CofE Aided Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013527_coordinator"], ["7NA", "Mathematics for the Million:'mathematics for my world'", "St. Andrew's CofE Aided Primary School", 377236.0, "Mathematics for the Million: \u2018mathematics for my world\u2019, is an extremely exciting, innovative and relevant project that has significant and far reaching potential influence to positively address the key features of a successful mathematics curriculum and purposeful pedagogic delivery. \u2018Maths for my world\u2019 articulates meaning to and of mathematics for pupils and aims to make mathematics purposeful and accessible to all in today\u2019s world. Whilst it encompasses elements of the current vogue for maths mastery, it is so much more than this.\r\nThis project aims at providing an innovative approach to the development of the teaching of mathematics that will enhance existing good practice in the area and essentially support teachers\u2019 skills confidence and competence to teach. \r\nOne of our primary aims therefore is to equip teachers to enable them to be 'experts', to discover, how this can be achieved and share the outcomes, and to ensure future generations of teachers are equipped and prepared to enter the profession with similar degrees of expertise and expectation.\r\nFurthermore, the project also very importantly places clear emphasis on the links to the real world and aims to embrace, instilll and facilitate 21st century skills for project participants across all groups: teachers, pupils\u2019, parents and others. We have chosen key intellectual outputs which we believe will allow us to systematically capture the broad scope of the project. We recognise that individuals experience of maths is not just affected by their teacher\u2019s competency, enthusiasm for example, as there are greater complexities to review, such as parental engagement and non-formal educational links.\r\n\r\nThe project allows us to look more broadly than this, as education cannot sit in isolation from the world it operates within. Our focus on influences and demands outside of the school setting will be vital to see how these can be influenced, engaged and understood. Through this, further opportunities and best practice can be identified and potential barriers to pupils and future adults can be removed. It will give all categories (schools, universities etc.) of participants\u2019 opportunities to reflect on their current practice and make changes in the light of our findings. \r\n\r\nOften business, sometimes parents too, is kept at arm\u2019s length by educationalists, as there can be a prevalent view that as the experts we know best! The project aims to engage with business, parents and local communities as this is the real world that we all operate within. Understanding and developing authentic parental engagements is going to be a key part of the project and seeing increased involvement and dialogue with parents is crucial to this. We believe that they have much to share, inform and teach stakeholders about their experiences of maths in their real worlds. We also want to engender in our communities the opportunities for pupils to experience real world maths through parents sharing their experiences and providing opportunities for pupils to have mini apprenticeships, where they get to experience maths being used in the workplace or community.\r\nAims:\r\n\u2022 Develop teachers\u2019 confidence, subject knowledge and skills set \r\n\u2022 Examine (and define) the best ways to deliver mathematical curricular content within the constraints of national agenda/expectations\r\n\u2022 Remove and (or affect) the fixed mindset that many parents, pupils and teachers have over the difficulty of mathematic  \r\n\u2022 Develop, innovate and identify materials and resources for teachers to use and children to select from, to improve pupil achievement, attitudes, participation and experience in mathematics\r\n\u2022 Develop children\u2019s understanding and mastery of mathematics, appreciating the contextual relevance of mathematics in all aspects of life.\r\nObjectives:\r\n\u2022 To explore the best practice within the jurisdictions of the participating countries and partners\r\n\u2022 To use real-life learning (and experiences) to excite, interest and deepen learning for pupils so they explore, use and appreciate the value and purpose of mathematics \r\n\u2022 Developing a holistic, community engagement in deepening children\u2019s contextual understanding of mathematics, in particular its significance to local, regional, national and international economic endeavours\r\n\u2022 To raise aspirations in overcoming anxieties in the use and application of mathematics, the access to future employment through secure and creative application of mathematics to a range of career pathways \r\n\u2022 To maximise digital technology, coding and robotics to equip pupils with a breadth of knowledge that is current, relevant and future proof \r\n\u2022 To equip teachers with the confidence to use a range of formal and non-formal techniques to deliver mathematics with interest and excitement, particularly in the areas that are difficult to deliver \r\n\u2022 Develop children\u2019s appreciation of the contextual significance of mathematics in their lives", "http://www.standrewscofe.co.uk", "Ermington Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036545_7"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PL20"}
