The increased efficiency of N use in dairy production is proposed as key action to reduce N contamination, and mathematical models provide a powerful tool to help with this. We are planning to use two models: The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS; a cow based model) and the Lifetime Nitrogen Efficiency (LNE; a herd based model). The models will be updated on amino acid metabolism (CNCPS), heifer growth and cattle fertility and economics (LNE) increasing not only their accuracy but also their commercial potential. In parallel, an intensive outreach program will incorporate farms in each country to describe N balance situation. This step will provide the necessary time to familiarize and accommodate farms with current model use. The last phase of the project consists on the implementation of the upgraded models in our pilot farms. This will provide a real life example that can generate a shift in agricultural practice towards more efficient and less polluting dairy industry. The European Union has been taken several initiatives either at a research level (e.g. FP-7 project RedNex) or at a legislative level (e.g. the National Emission Ceilings directive 2001/81/EC; currently under revision) to reduce N pollution from dairy production. However, few strategies have been converted into agricultural practice because of the lack of an applied step linking research strategies with the dairy industry. This is the strength of the current project that includes four non-academic partners that consult on thousands of European dairy farms and six European and American academic institutions, two of which developed the models, but all highly prestigious in their countries and internationally.", 47079.0, 961200.0, "CowficieNcy", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_216433_918859855"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["3JD", "Sotsiaalse kaasamise ja t\u00f6\u00f6v\u00f5ime j\u00f5ustamise rahvusvaheline p\u00e4devus", "The Stowers and Associates", 13547.0, "The objective of the project is the international competency of the members of the consortium \u2013 training institutions and associations offering adult education and the coordinator of the fields of educational and social services of local government \u2013 in the fields of social involvement and empowerment of the ability to work.The achievement of the objective is essential in order to affect positive developments in the labour market, where long-term unemployment on the one hand and the structured lack of a workforce on the other hand impede the developments of the Estonian economy and general welfare. With a reform of the ability to work a large number of people with a limited ability to work totalling ca 100,000 in Estonia enter the labour market. In addition to general and vocational education where training and tutoring are received by the youth, it is inevitable to work and develop also the awareness and self-control of the adult, in order to maintain their coping and motivation to contribute with their work to the developments of themselves, the community and society.The members of the consortium have basic know-how for the training of the unemployed adult. This project is aimed at the amendment and quality upgrade of that know-how. Members of the consortium with an experience in the training of the unemployed, as well as Estonia as a whole, have not enough skills, knowledge and experience for the skilful motivation, training and tutoring of the long-term unemployed and people with a limited ability to work, as well as employers and the long-term unemployed; this project is aimed at the obtainment therefore.The project involves the preparation, carrying through of three study trips in the form of work shadowing observation at experienced foreign partners \u2013 in the University of Uludag in Turkey, with an experience in the professional counselling and training of the deaf, at LC Educational in Cyprus with an experience in the diagnose and design of curricula and the training of employers, and at Stowers and Associates in the UK, with an experience in the organisation of supported work, training of job couches and inclusive cooperation. An integral part of a study trip is the assessment and application of results in the daily work of the members of the consortium.Project management takes place by the consortium\u2019s project team coordinated by the project manager of the coordinator. The cooperation and tasks, rights and obligations of the members of the consortium are fixed in an agreement concluded at the beginning of the project, which also states the tasks of the partners. A specific study trip agreement is concluded with every participant in a study trip, which states essential circumstances of the study trip \u2013 period, location, programme, methodical preparation, expected results and needs for application.In order to methodologically prepare study trips, the coordinator organises roundtable Skype meetings with the partners and required practical materials introducing the expertise of the partner.Project management focuses on the coordination and observation of the completion of agreements.The result of study trips is the international competency of the social inclusion and empowerment of the ability to work of the members of the consortium, which, when applied in the daily work of the organisations, contributes to an increase in the awareness, motivation and professional preparation of the long-term unemployed and people with a limited ability to work, as well as employers, and thus results in a positive effect on the professional and day-to-day coping thereof.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-EE01-KA104-013413_3"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["3LH", "MOLE VALLEY FARMERS LIMITED", 47102.0, "Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions \u2014 generating, developing and transferring new skills, knowledge and innovation (15.03.01.01)", "fts_2017_24006", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "EX36"}
