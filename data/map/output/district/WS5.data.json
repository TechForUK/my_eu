Based in Newcastle under Lyme Staffordshire, it operates nationally through local franchises and currently has 15 licensees and approximately 450 learners. It delivers language courses for adults where the focus is on fun and conversation rather than results and written work. It expanded into Spanish in 2010 and whereas French classes are delivered at all levels (Beginners, Improvers, Intermediate and Advanced), Spanish is currently only delivered up to Improvers level. In order to successfully expand the area of the business devoted to delivering Spanish courses to adults, there is a need to optimise the quality of the teaching in this area. The proficiency of tutors themselves in the target language is of paramount importance in professionally delivering courses to paying students and in enhancing the reputation and image of the organisation. \r\nIt is a key need, therefore, of the organisation to enable its tutors and licensees to continuously improve their knowledge and understanding of, in this case, Spanish, thereby increasing their competence and confidence in using it. There is also an ongoing need for developing and refining existing materials, tools and techniques used in the classroom. As a small organisation it is critical to be able to share good practice with others working in the same field and to provide relevant training to its licensees and tutors within tight budgetary restraints.\r\nThe selected course relevant to this application is the Training Course in Teaching and Learning of Spanish Language and Culture (Adult Education) in Malaga organised by LEAP. The specific educational aims of the course match closely those identified above, namely:\r\n\u2022 develop knowledge and understanding of the\r\n   target language\r\n\u2022 increase competence and confidence in using the\r\n   target language\r\n\u2022 further develop knowledge and understanding\r\n   of teaching techniques for specific groups, and\r\n   provide teachers with an array of ready-made\r\n   teaching resources suitable for their learners\r\n\u2022 provide an opportunity to share good practice\r\n\u2022 provide participants with an opportunity to work\r\n  collaboratively in developing their own teaching\r\n  materials\r\nThe intended participant is a linguist by background with A levels in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Latin and a Ba Hons in French from the University of Leeds.

In 2013 he graduated as a fully qualified teacher gaining a DTLLS with merit from Staffordshire University.He is our licensee for Spanish and French for a number of towns around Newcastle and for Spanish for Newcastle itself and his number of students continues to grow. Due to his success in building up new and existing teaching venues for Spanish and his commitment to the business going forward, he has shown that investment in further training is very likely to bring benefit to the organisation. His good interpersonal skills also makes him the ideal candidate to share the benefits of his training across the organisation with other licensees  However he does need to improve his Spanish to increase his confidence and competence at a higher level.\r\nThe expected impact of the course is to: maximise the motivation, confidence and competence of the participant and support his need for professional and personal development; improve the ability of the organisation to deliver high quality Spanish tuition thereby enhancing its reputation and image and enabling it to grow the business in the identified target market; optimise the experience of its learners in attending courses which in turn will help the business grow through word of mouth; help to develop relationships between British and Spanish nationals .", "http://www.leaponline.eu", "Language for Fun Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA104-000034_1"], ["3DH", "Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality", "Language Education And Partnerships  LTD", 14023.0, "On the one hand, the \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" project is meant to contribute directly to Babel Center's developmental strategy as provider of foreign language teaching services to adults.  On the other hand, it contributes to the organization's strategic objective to become an innovation center as far as working with adults is concerned locally, nationally and internationally.\r\n\r\nBabel Center was set up 9 years ago by a group of young teachers who believe in lifelong learning and have always looked for ways to best answer the adults' need of learning a foreign language in the easiest and most enjoyable way possible. In time the team of teachers has grown, as well as the number of languages taught (at the moment there are 10). The needs of the adult learners have also changed together with the new technologies and increasing opportunities of using a foreign language. At this stage, the challenge for the organization is to find creative ways to respond to the needs of the adult learners, to keep them interested in the whole range of foreign languages, i. e. to build up a system that assures high quality of the courses delivered and keeps teachers motivated to develop professionally and innovate.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge for the organization is to positions itself within the international context of foreign language teaching. In 2010-2012 we ran our first Learning Partnership project within the Grundtvig Program. Having had the chance to collaborate with other 8 institutions, most of them foreign language teaching centers, has proved the importance of learning in an international context, and has also indicated ways in which the Babel team can contribute through its expertise to creating a European know-how in this field. During the last 2 years, the confidence in the teachers' expertise has grown as a result of the excellent feedback they have received for presentations and workshops delivered at local, national and international conferences and seminars. In this sense, establishing international contacts and access to the best resources of expertise in 2014-2015 can mean a leap forward towards the the higher goal of bringing Romanian added value to the European level by means of future partnership projects, as well as by a high quality offer of Erasmus+ trainings in the field of teaching foreign languages.\r\n\r\nThe project \"Fast Forward on Innovation and Quality\" fulfills its objectives by organizing 9 European mobilities which involves the participation on 13 members of the organization. Special attention has been given that all levels of the organization are offered the opportunity of international mobility, from Junior trainers to the management team taking into consideration their motivation and area of interest/ expertise, as well as their ability to disseminate information on a local, national and international level.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the project are coordinated by a support team, consisting of people with experience in international collaborations and project management. The project involves a stage of preparing the mobilities, of 9 actions taking place throughout 2014-2015, of organizing dissemination activities in various frameworks (in the organization, in Edu-Cafe - the Resource Center for Teachers, national and international conferences, The Romanian Institute for Adult Teaching) and assessment.\r\n\r\nThe 9 actions represent participation at training sessions for developing creative methodologies in language teaching and for creating learning communities (Creative Methodology, The Creative Classroom, Building Positive Group Dynamics), using new technologies and adapting them to future requirements (Future Learning - Using Ipads and Tablets, Education for Tomorrow) and for developing high quality systems (Teach. Learn, Quality, Finnish Lessons for European Schools), and finally for developing linguistic, cultural and methodological competences in teaching the Roman languages, i. e. French and Italian.\r\n\r\nThe results of taking part at these mobilities will be a set of individual competences connected to latest knowledge, which are extremely important abilities for the 21st century trainer and for the management of an innovative school.  On top of that, increased self-confidence and inter-cultural openness within the European context will boost participants' motivation to exchange views in various dissemination activities and in future projects possibly generated within the networking done during these mobilities.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of the project, including the way the present application has been written, the proposed approach is one of partnership and responsibility of all parties involved.

Moreover, the majority  has only basic ITskills, at lessons using only to a small extent the It resources, and their teaching practices are traditional, lacking modern ITapproaches . \r\n2)to introduce and change something according to the direction endorsed by the Ministry, the Europe 2020 strategy (integration of IT in education), the management team finds that it is not prepared to implement the change (to be one with long\u2013term effects, sustainable and to ensure the institutional progress). The management team considers the opportunity of the institutional development to be possible only through the correct, consistent and sustainable integration of the new technologies in the teaching act (interactive boards and tablets). The management team needs to adopt a new management strategy based on a well defined digital learning policy, with consistent and appropriate activities and an efficient use  of the management tools (management plan, procedures). The team considers that all these things may be learnt and that teachers may be trained within the structured courses provided by the EU host organisations with valuable experiences and results in the areas described above.  Thus, the purpose of the project is to foster the modernization of the education provided by the school, by developing and steering digital learning policies with a representative target group from the teaching staff (11 teachers out of 38), which will use an innovative approach and expand the use of ICT in the educational process, developing the digital learning with interactive whiteboards and tablets as attractive and effective means of study, between 1.09.2015-1.09.2017.

We have carefully considered how educators in adult education (through their work in raising literacy and languages skills of adults) can support the wider European agenda. \r\n\r\nIn particular, we have considered the following:\r\n \u2018The current difficult economic climate has highlighted the importance of education as a catalyst for economic growth ... We have to tackle the problem of 80 million low-skilled adults whose future looks increasingly marginal in a Europe that will concentrate on knowledge-intensive jobs.\u2019 (European Commission 2012)\r\n\u2018To increase economic competitiveness and create a more equitable and inclusive society, lifelong learning should be a reality for everyone in the EU. Adults participation in lifelong learning should be increased, particularly for individuals and groups at risk of exclusion, such as those with a low level of education\u2019 (Bruges Communiqu\u00e9 and ET 2020 Strategy).\r\n\r\nTherefore, there are significant imperatives to increase the participation rates within adult education, to achieve higher standards of literacy and language skills for \u2018everyone\u2019 eligible to benefit from the various aspects of lifelong learning. Clearly this objective serves the interests of individuals and the wider European community. \r\nThe real challenge to educators beyond the rhetoric is to formulate learning experiences that appeal to target learners, attracting and retaining participants up to and beyond the point where positive benefits are evident. Therefore, this project primarily aims to provide educators with learning and teaching methodologies and pedagogical approaches to deliver key competencies and basic skills such as literacy and languages.\r\nThe main focus of the projecr is to increase the competencies of teachers in providing learners in adult education with the key essential skills they need for fulfillment in society. The project focuses especially on the development of methodologies around three existing bodies of knowledge and techniques, namely Creative Thinking, Informal Learning and ICT in the development of literacy and language skills, which are considered catalysts in today's European society and activation. \r\nThe consortium includes public and private organisations representing adult education and higher education, all having good networks with contacts at, local, regional, national and European levels, providing a good geographical representation in Europe -UK: LEAP Ltd; DE: VHS Cham; HR: Faculty of Teacher Education; IT: Istituto comprensivo 10.\r\nA structured approach to the project development is planned based on shared collaborative principles through which partners will engage in a number of planned activities in order to achieve the following  expected results:\r\n* a set of guidelines around the key principles of creative thinking;\r\n* a training package which includes a set of modules around the key thematic areas of creative thinking\r\n* 5 training /multiplier events/workshops in which selected staff will be trained around the key thematic areas of creative thinking \r\n* a compilation of good practice examples around the key thematic areas\r\n* a project portal which will include interactive training materials and a repository \r\n* multiplier events (1 in each country) as a tools for mainstreaming the project results and materials\r\n* DVD for raising awareness of the project tools/outputs and training materials\r\n* a professional development course plan for delivering of the project outputs even after the project officially ends. \r\nThe project will impact in the short and long term on the ability of adult education providers, teachers, educators, trainers and learners as it aims to support changes directly into the wider educational community. We would hope that the project will impact on the educational community by providing:\r\n* Direct access to creative thinking methods and tools within  with a European focus\r\n* Improve literacy and language learners to be better and more active in society and improve engagement levels, especially of those at risk of exclusion, by raising the educators skills and competences in providing effective learning situation for adults.", "http://www.leaponline.eu", "Language Education And Partnerships  LTD", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA204-000081_coordinator"], ["3DH", "Digitally Competent Youth", "Language Education And Partnerships  LTD", 206518.0, "In today\u2019s world, where the need for lifelong learning has been accepted and new technologies have taken on a significant role in increasing employability among young people, there is no other option than to reconsider the objectives of education, especially in non-formal context in the light of growing societal demands and new sociocultural trends. \r\nThe current level of unemployment among young people (under 25s) is unprecedented and stood at 22.7% in the EU27 in 2012, this statistic led EU Members to set up a programme to address youth unemployment in order to support growth and employment\"Compact for Growth and Jobs\". Also Europe 2020 strategy aims to increase employment rates and educational levels and reduce poverty levels. One of the core elements to achieve the targets of these initiatives is to understand how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can be used to leverage impact. Young people have grown up using ICT, but for not all have used ICT for professional purposes thus theay may struggle with gaining job-oriented competences, critical attitudes and creativity remain. By providing a solution to these struggles it may better the role of ICT in terms of increasing the employability of young people and help to fight social exclusion and poverty. To increase the competences of ICT, it would impact on young people could provide additional inputs to the implementation of the relevant policies and flagship initiatives.\r\nTherefore, the project DIGI.COM/YOUTH aims to foster the provision and the assessment of digital competences by supporting personalised learning approaches, collaborative learning, and the strategic use of ICT. \r\nThe project contributes to the achievement of one the four strategic objectives of the Education and Training 2020: to improve the quality and efficiency of education and training, all citizens need to be able to acquire digital competences and all levels of education and training need to be made more attractive and efficient. DIGI.COM/YOUTH intends to provide young people in transition to labour market or education, with the necessary digital assessment of competences to tackle their everyday necessities as learners in a digital world, and as professionals on the labour market. It is likely to have a positive impact on the persons directly or indirectly involved in the activities, such as: increased level of digital competence, and better understanding and recognition of skills and qualifications in Europe and beyond.\r\nThis project goes onto to offer embedded assessment with instant feedback and targeted support to provide more personalised, engaging, collaborative and authentic tasks.\r\nThe project will design Digital Challenges directly connected within the five Areas of the framework DIGCOMP: Information, Communication, Content creation, Safety and Problem solving which will be included on a Moodle platform.  On this platform learners will have to solve a set of digital challenges (quizzes and tasks to do, dealing with Google Apps, Dropbox, Social Networks, etc.), and they will be able to cooperate with each other through the forum; they will have to exchange messages creating different threads for each topic, and will acquire the necessary knowledge to take over the challenge and start the next one. Youth workers, trainers and tutors working in the context of young disadvantaged or in in danger of social exclusion, will be able to utilise a Guidebook specifically developed in parallel to both the Digital Challenges and the Moodle platform. This document will serve not only as a how-to for the platform, but also provide information on the state-of-art of ICT and digital competences, information on DIGCOMP framework and other up-to-date methodologies on ICT. \r\nThe consortium expects to make impact with the DIGI.COM/YOUTH project in four European countries - DE, ES, PL and the UK. They will address stakeholders in each of these countries in an array of institutions such as, universities, social and cultural organisations working with and for young disadvantaged, public administrations etc. The impact will be made by developing a better system of matching between skills and the labour market needs among those young people who are in danger of social exclusion in the transition process between education and labour market. The more customized process of learning (practical tasks and embedded assessment) will be matched to individual needs including those with special requests, reinforcing the development of essential soft skills such as a problem-solving and collaborative work necessary to equip persons, especially young, for the labour market.", "http://www.leaponline.eu", null, "erasmus_2014-2-DE04-KA205-001363_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WS5"}
