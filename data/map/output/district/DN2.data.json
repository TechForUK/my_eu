Total in the 14 countries there is 425.000 deaf citizens. Sign language is not an international language that can be used everywhere with everyone. That is why there is a need for the sign language dictionary Spread the Sign that gather each country\u2019s individual sign language and show it in a standardized pedagogic way, free of charge on the web and in mobile apps. This project is truly vocational and innovative. A large number of 360-degree images will be photographed in each country. In each 360 photo there will be numerous objects visual that in this project will get a hotspot and connection to the right sign language video in the dictionary. \r\nThe vocational students and their trainers will get an amazing visual tool for understanding the objects context and origin as well as an easy way to locate and learn its sign and to get the vocabulary for their education. To learn your own language, even if you are deaf, is a human right.

Our dissemination activities will enable this impact and will increase the use of this dictionary as a pedagogical and learning tool.\r\nWith our work, we seek to contribute to the expansion of educational and lifetime horizons for deaf vocations pupils and other deaf pupil, as well as to provide important tools for teachers of deaf and, ultimately, to contribute to social inclusion, to increase the levels of literacy and social participation of deaf people.\r\nThe Spread the Sign dictionary aims to do this on a 360 degree, more and more, throughout the European and World.", "http://www.deaf-trust.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA202-039088_2"], [2015, "Spread Share - connecting trainers of deaf pupils in Europe", "Doncaster Deaf Trust", 291046.0, 14, 14, "Spread Share project emerges on the continuation of Spread the Sign projects that have been developed since 2006. Spread the Sign (www.spreadthesign.com) is an online free multilingual dictionary of sign languages. The partnership is composed by experienced teams that worked in previous projects, as well as new partners that will give their contribution to this new stage and to the spreading of sign language all over Europe. \r\nThe Spread Share project aims to develop a platform in which teachers and trainers of deaf pupils can upload and download self-made materials that can be used in pedagogical practices with deaf pupils. These materials can be sign language videos or other documents that can be helpful for other teachers of deaf. This share platform will be integrated in the Spread the Sign dictionary. Users will have registered access, so no jeopardizing will be allowed to other users or contents. At the same time, a Google Map function with sign language videos with names of cities, locals, buildings and other objects, will be incorporated in the platform. Through these tools, teachers of deaf will be able to share documents, inspiring other teachers across the countries and Europe.\r\nThere will be 14 partner institutions, among which deaf schools, deaf organisations and universities. All of them have experience with sign languages and deaf education, and all have the most interest in promote and improve these two areas. Accumulated knowledge in previous projects is an assurance of quality and responsibility to develop this project.\r\nPartners will contact target groups (teachers and trainers of deaf pupils) to participate in the development of this share platform, testing is usability and filling it with pedagogical contents. Also, they will be responsible for the national production of sign language videos for the dictionary and the Google Map function, as well as for the quality assurance of the uploaded materials. All teams will participate in dissemination events in order to present the share platform to new users. The feedback of users will be mobilized to improve this project\u2019s products and results, and it will be assembled through standardized instruments such as questionnaires and interviews. Other indicators, such as using statistics will be used to monitor the use of the platform.\r\nThis is a breakthrough in what concerns sign language and deaf education promotion all over Europe, so a big number of users is expected since the beginning. The expected impact in deaf pupils education is not easily measurable once there are hundreds of thousands teachers and pupils all over Europe. Being this a transnational tool, we expect to reach a lot of them, contributing to change and ameliorate pedagogical practices and educational achievements.\r\nOur ultimate goals are the improvement of deaf pupils education and the modification of policy makers posture, making the give more attention to this population.

As a result, international communication between deaf people requires the learning of a foreign sign language, in precisely the same way as with people who can hear.\r\nHowever, despite the clear incentives to promote multilingualism provided by the European Commission\u2019s VET policies, very few of the projects and learning materials created over the years have taken into consideration the needs of deaf people. Their opportunities to learn foreign sign languages therefore remain severely limited, which effectively represents a major obstacle to transnational communication between deaf people and therefore a limitation of their citizenship rights, particularly in terms of free circulation.\r\nWithin this context, this project aims to:\r\na) Carry out research into foreign sign language learning needs, identifying the most urgent communication needs;\r\nb) Create a common training programme for foreign sign language learning at elementary (A1/A2) level for Portuguese, British, Turkish and Austrian sign languages (NB: on the contrary to oral language, Austrian is different from German);\r\nc) Validate these programmes in schools for the deaf located in the partner countries by means of involving sign language trainers, who will therefore play a double role as both learners and trainers;\r\nd) Promote the learning of the sign languages of the partnership among all the entities working with the project, especially among trainers, teachers and researchers in this area;\r\ne) Promote the exchange of knowledge and experience among the professionals involved and among the deaf communities in each partner country;\r\nf) Facilitate the learning of a foreign sign language directly from the native sign language, i.e. without having to subject the learner to the intermediate acquisition of the respective written languages.\r\nThe GIVE ME A SIGN project will, in this way, make an important contribution towards closing the knowledge gap regarding the learning of foreign sign languages, with special emphasis on removing the additional burden of having to previously learn the respective written languages. This is itself represents a major innovation in this area. The project will therefore facilitate communication between the deaf communities across Europe and consequently open the doors to mobility for this target population, which will in turn contribute decisively towards ensuring equal opportunities. GIVE ME A SIGN also aims to promote the recognition of European sign languages as official languages of each country, and indeed as part of the national heritage of each member state in just the same way as the oral languages of the EU, this contributing towards public awareness  of the value of this form of communication.\r\nIn the medium term, the results of this project will subsequently serve as the foundations for a second project in which, based on the findings of our research and the resulting creation of learning programmes, the partnership will begin to create learning content and materials, with particular emphasis on mobile applications to assist the learning of foreign sign languages. This is an ideal platform, given the limitless visual possibilities of tools such as Skype or FaceTime. Our ultimate goal is therefore to work towards a situation in which the learning of foreign sign languages becomes not only much easier but also a realistic curricular option for training institutes working with deaf people, so that in the not too distant future these trainees will be able to finally participate on equal terms in transnational professional mobility initiatives. \r\nGIVE ME A SIGN is therefore expected to become a reference for the teaching and learning of foreign sign languages. On a global level, over 110 million citizens use sign languages as part of everyday communication. This number includes the deaf, their families, their teachers and auxiliaries, among many others, and is a number which cannot and should not be ignored, given the expected impact of this ground-breaking project. In addition, the dissemination of the project aims to reach many millions more, by developing awareness among those able to hear, of the advantages not only of learning to communicate with the deaf, but also of ensuring they are included as equals in both everyday and professional life.", "http://www.deaf-trust.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PT01-KA202-012971_1"], [2015, "Sign Language Speaking Tour Guides", "Doncaster Deaf Trust", 88750.0, 5, 8, "When Turkey Disability Survey and Turkey Employment Agency\u2019s data are examined together, the maximum of %15 of hearing impaired individuals are capable to work and only 5% of them are employed. It can be said that, 95% of hearing impaired individuals are unemployed. The target audience of our Project is hearing impaired individuals between the ages of 18-30 who don\u2019t have any business.The basic desire of the hearing impaired individuals is to find a respectable place in society by producing as every healthy human. To participate in their social life, depends to sustain independent living. The most important way to ensure this is employment. If hearing impaired individuals work, produce and gain, they participate in social life and get happy. Unemployment is a huge problem. The most important aim for the hearing impaired should be to remove this issue from the agenda of them. Our main reason for making this Project is to prepare a new certification program for hearing impaired individuals in order to provide employment.With this study, we will educate hearing impaired tour guides who use sign language and we will offer different job opportunities to hearing impaired people by creating a new model of vocational training. A training program is not available in this area. If appropriate educational areas are created, numerous hearing impaired people may be employed in this sector. Well trained persons with disabilities will have more opportunities to have a job. This study is a first and completely original work to open a new field of employment for hearing impaired citizens in our country. At first, the participants that we trained will work with professional tour guides as assistants. There isn\u2019t a certificate program for hearing impaired individuals for being tour guides with cockades in our country. This certificate program will be created within our project.
