The current method of linking these parts together is by mechanical coupling. Effective decontamination of such instruments is challenging but is critical to avoid cross infection between patients. The geometry of the instrument assembly (particularly bone reamers and similar tools used in joint implants) have crevices at the joints which are difficult and expensive to clean and fully sterilise. Welded instruments would eliminate this problem.\n\nApproximately 7000 cases of MRSA infections were reported in UK hospitals during 2007 and similar issues are prevalent across Europe. Such infections are of particular concern in post-surgery patients. The CleanTools project aims to develop technology which will reduce this issue by making surgical instruments easier to clean and disinfect. The crevice between stainless steel cutting heads and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) flexible shafts currently makes decontamination challenging, time consuming and chemically intensive. Additionally there have been instances of cutting heads becoming detached from the flexible drive shaft during use, causing undue implications in theatre and potential long term impacts on patient quality of life.\n\nThe desirable materials for these tools, such as SMAs and stainless steels, are challenging to weld and their properties are severely degraded when they are melted in conventional welding. CleanTools will provide a method for the manufacture of surgical instruments containing SMA materials though the use of rotary friction welding (RFW). RFW is a low heat input solid phase welding technology that will preserve the properties of the materials in question. CleanTools will improve the function of flexible surgical instruments, reduce the required cleaning and disinfection effort, improve reliability and reduce the cost of manufacture within Europe.", 64223.0, 1184346.0, "CleanTools", "Better surgical tools for fewer infections", "Many flexible tools used in orthopaedic surgery are made of multiple materials linked by mechanical coupling. Using a no-melt welding process instead promises to improve sterilisation of hard-to-reach places.", "Bone reamers are used to form or enlarge holes in bone prior to insertion of prostheses. They are made of stainless steel cutting heads and shape memory alloy (SMA) flexible shafts. Mechanical coupling creates crevices that are difficult to clean and sterilise, increasing the risk of infection and, increasingly, of antibiotic-resistant infection. Welding could eliminate the crevices and contamination but the properties of stainless steel and SMAs are severely degraded when melted.\n\nTo solve the problem, scientists launched the EU-funded project http://www.cleantools.de/ (CLEANTOOLS). The team is exploiting rotary friction welding (RFW), a novel solid-state process that softens materials with friction heat and coalesces them with compressive force.\n\nUtilisation of RFW will require careful consideration of the materials for biocompatibility, service requirements and weld properties. In addition to legislative and literature reviews, researchers conducted experimental tests pointing to the need for an interlayer between the SMA and the stainless steel.\n\nNumerous weld trials have been conducted with the selected materials to optimise weld parameters to achieve required joint strength and ductility. Having demonstrated consistent tensile and guided bend test results, the team is now investigating commercialisation opportunities for this novel technology.\n\nCLEANTOOLS is on its way to delivering a method for producing surgical instruments with enhanced function and ease of cleaning. Exploitation of RFW will improve reliability, decrease manufacturing costs and reduce patient infections for major benefits across the board.", null, "http://www.coringroup.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/148693.jpg", "fp7_102178_959926454"], ["1QA", "Real Time, Secure Equine ID Information Platform (EQR-Equid)", "Equine Register Limited", "Criminal activities associated with horse and ponies are widespread across Europe.

This has led to an increased awareness about the importance and specific management of veteran trees. As defined in the VETree project, there is now an increased number of training possibilities on the subject: now that the project has ended, both partner organisations and others continue organising the VETree basic course or have included veteran tree management in arboricultural and forestry training. In addition translations to additional languages are being produced. Nevertheless, there is no formal recognition of skills and knowledge in veteran tree management. When contracting an arboricultural professional, regardless of  any previous training, it is impossible to assess whether he or she has reached the required minimum level of skills and knowledge to complete the assignment. When dealing with invaluable and irreplaceable veteran and ancient trees with high cultural, landscape and ecological values, owners and site managers are reluctant to delegate work to unfamiliar contractors, leading to non-transparent tender procedures and market foreclosure. This project aims at harmonising skills recognition in veteran tree management, which will increase mobility of tree workers across Europe and raise standards in veteran tree care across Europe. This goal will be pursued by defining a common European minimum level of skills and knowledge for arboricultural and forestry professionals and defining a clear and objective certification procedure to test the skills and knowledge level in veteran tree management of arborists and foresters. To optimise the design of the VETcert certification procedure, the project will start with a survey of existing certification and assessment schemes, both within arboriculture and forestry and beyond. The combined network of all project partners allows for an almost complete coverage of certification initiatives on a global, European, national and regional level. Starting from this survey will assure that we include best practices in certification and that we avoid common pitfalls in the setup of a certification scheme.Parallel to the survey of certification schemes, national/regional/informal standards in veteran tree management will be collected and reviewed. For this, we can partially rely on work already done during the VETree project (survey of training material). Based on this input a common European minimum standard in veteran tree management skills and knowledge level will be developed. This will be done at 2 operational levels: a European minimum standard for practicing arborists/foresters and a European minimum standard for consulting arborists/foresters. Since arboriculture and forestry are generally not  an 'exact science', different approaches exist to veteran tree management. The wide geographic distribution and diverse background of the partnership, along with thorough testing and extensive feedback loops with all stakeholders, will ensure that different approaches to veteran tree management are taken into account while developing the standards and thus that the project's products will have a wide acceptance.Once the standards have been developed, comparison with existing training material (mainly as a result of the VETree project) will allow the  detection of possible gaps. The project will aim to fill key gaps, which we anticipate may largely relate to the need for very practical based training which may be best fulfilled by using visual media such as videos and still photographs, and case studies.Once the common standards have been agreed upon, the VETcert certification and examination procedure will be designed for each operational level (practicing/consulting), as an add-on to existing certification schemes. A key certification scheme to take into account will be the European Tree Worker/European Tree Technician certification, Europe's major arboricultural certification scheme, administered by the European Arboricultural Council (included in the partnership). Additional test case certification schemes will be national certification schemes in the UK, France and Czech Republic, countries where ETW/ETT is not (yet) widespread. This approach and the broad partnership with several key organisations will ensure an easy adoption of the VETCert certification products by the industry (both contracting parties and contractors) and a cost effective, low maintenance but secure future of the project's output.
