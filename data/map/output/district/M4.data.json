This CHEST Community has been started with 18 important organizations already involved as  supporting partners;- create a liquid information and social deliberation platform, based on a cooperative awareness approach and implemented on top of a broad spectrum of social media, which gives voice to communities bearing interests about hard-to-solve, high-impact social problems. The platform promotes the emergence of innovative solutions and allows a transparent and collective testing and selection of social innovation experiments;- launch and manage three rounds of open calls to distribute a consistent part of our project budget (around 2,5 Million euro); these funds will be allocated with a public competition for ideas with social innovation, and measure the effectiveness of proposed responses to social problems.

Among them, freight carriers and shippers are interested in minimizing freight logistics costs in order to maximize their profits, while maintaining a competitive level of service to their customers. City administrators and residents are oriented towards a decrease in traffic congestion, social costs and environmental nuisances, even though they are often direct beneficiaries of high quality delivery services. This leads to a multitude of differing and possibly conflicting objectives that are involved in urban freight transport planning and decision making, yielding a high level of complexity. This provides a main motivation for the development of tools for helping decision makers to reach higher grades of efficiency. \nDespite growing academic interest, the extent to which freight transport is acknowledged and formally considered in local authority transport planning varies considerably from country to country, and on a more local level, between towns and cities. As a result, policy development with respect to urban freight and city logistics is characterised by a rather fragmented approach, with many city authorities finding it difficult to address the complex set of differing views of a large variety of stakeholders. \nThe proposed project will be aimed at identifying local authority planning needs with regards to urban/city logistics activities and the necessary pre-requisites for inclusion of stakeholders in the process.

The Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application (COLA) project aims to increase the adoption of cloud computing services by the above mentioned two strategic target communities.

However, the dynamic and intelligent utilization of cloud infrastructure resources from the perspective of cloud applications is not trivial. Although there have been several efforts to support the intelligent and coordinated deployment, and to a smaller extent also the run-time orchestration of cloud applications, no comprehensive solution has emerged until now that could be applied in large scale near operational level industry trials. The overall objective of the COLA project is that by building on and extending current research results, it will define and provide a reference implementation of a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications.

However, the creatives e.g. musicians, photographers, filmmakers etc. primarily face two barriers to enter this market. Firstly, they do not have a traditional CV. Their history is all about their work i.e. their projects and art but not the places where they have worked. They struggle to present their CV in the traditional way, which makes it harder for them to find work. Secondly, many persons need to collaborate in a project and only a few are recognised. When a project is uploaded to online services like SoundCloud, Vimeo etc. only the uploader gets recognition. It is only linked to their account. The people behind the scenes e.g. vocalists, editors, producers etc. remain unrecognised. Social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Youtube, Fiverr, Behance also could not address these issues.\nTo address these problems we have developed Twine, the professional network for the creative industry, as well as a marketplace that ensures tie-up between the prospective employers and the freelance creatives. When someone publishes a project they credit all the people who contributed to it. The project is then automatically added to everyone\u2019s profile - giving everyone the corresponding recognition they deserve.

We focus on two main issues:\r\n- the immigration related issues in connection to refugee crisis and discrimination towards immigrants and\r\n- emigration of young people in connection to youth unemployment.\r\nAs migrants (especially refugees) are often in situations where they might be marginalized or could fall into poverty, it is very important to include them in society and create equal chances for everyone by including them in social, economic and cultural life. From the other side there are opportunities for the young people in difficult situations (unemployed, school drop outs etc) who could take advantage of migration by using the mobility programmes such as European Voluntary Service and gain new skills abroad and in this way improve their chances to be fully involved in European society. However, in this case it's important to make sure that the young people know about their rights in EU and will not let their rights be violated.\r\nThe overall aim of the long term training course is to train youth workers, youth leaders being aware of different migration schemes in Europe and know how to deal with challenges resulting from migration and how to use opportunities created by migration in their work with young people. Our participants will be ready to develop projects connected to migration and mobility, engage young migrants in their activities and foster mobility among youth. They can also help to change the general image of migration in society and promote tolerance and positive attitude towards immigrants (and refugees in particular) in society. \r\nThere will be 40 youth workers, youth leaders from United Kingdom, Romania, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Moldova, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Serbia participanting in our training courses.
