Recent research portrays economic growth as a process of evolution of ecosystems of technologies and industrial capabilities.  This research has also shown a strong relationship between the development of the complexity of economies in a globalized market and overall output growth. ICT based tools, in particular complex systems analysis, simulation, systems science methods, and big data capabilities offer policymakers new opportunities to empirically map technology and capability ecosystems of countries and industrial sectors, analyse their structure, understand their dynamics, measure economic complexity, and design policy interventions more likely to have positive impacts on growth over time.  This project proposes to apply ICT tools in this way to yield insights on the industrial competitiveness and fragility of countries, the evolution of technologies and capabilities, the network of products, the adaptability of companies, and the ecology of E-commerce.

While artificial sensing devices exist that can monitor environmental parameters of interest, such as temperature or humidity, the focus of our research will be on the use of plants themselves as sensing and decision-making devices.<br/>The holistic approach we propose is novel: while plants as bio-sensors have been the object of previous studies, prior work has focused on the study of the sensing capabilities of individual plants in a controlled laboratory environment.

Their intermittent nature however poses significant challenges for the energy system as peak demand from the system and peak production form those intermittent sources do not overlap.

In 2009 Opera Circus began to develop a long term series of youth and school's exchanges, cultural and arts programmes between Dorset UK and the Srebrenica region. Participants from these communities realised that they had many of the same problems. High youth unemployment, 67% in Srebrenica, 27% in Dorset, very low wages when jobs were found, no higher educational facilities nearby, difficulty in finding somewhere to live in the same area due to cost and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world due to living in semi rural and rural environments. Young people in these communities can also suffer from high levels of abuse, poverty, crime, drug and alcohol related problems.  In Srebrenica, there is the hangover from the genocide and high levels of PTSD.  As a result of this need a number of partners in the UK began to develop projects together with partners through the work of Opera Circus in the Balkan region.  One of the projects was, Simply Human, the final event in the highly successful EU Cultural Project Wake Up. http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2012/05/08/simply-human-success-750000-heard-about-us/  This led to a number of other youth projects both in Srebrenica and Dorset including http://www.operacircus.co.uk/wp/2013/04/02/like-a-film-in-my-mind-youth-in-action-programme/ and a youth in action job shadowing programme linking youth centres.  As a result of this learning process along with the current economic and political climate in Europe, Opera Circus suggested to the partners and participants, a new programme of work. \r\nThe Complete Freedom of Truth - Youth Theatre and the Creative Arts, is a long term process designed to use cultural and arts activities to provide skills training and cultural awareness for young people by developing their own creativity. The project aims to raise consciousness and encourage a vision of an equal, inclusive and truly democratic society.  The project will be led through a process of youth exchanges and youth workers mobility and with non formal learning at its heart.

There are 12 partner organisations in total raging from youth centres, youth theatre groups, a university, leading international cultural organisations, a city and local authorities making TCFT a unique, exciting and robust melting pot of expertise, knowledge and disciplines. TCFT will work directly with 180 young people, 24 group leaders and 48 youth workers over the 24 months period in a combination face-to-face meetings and ongoing online training.  Young people involved in the project are socially disadvantaged and TCFT will work directly with at least 70 disabled young people.

The project is administrated by the \u00ab kulturzentrum Hertha Firnberg\u00bb. There are 41 companies available as project partners in France, Spain, United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Germany,  Malta and Belgium . Many companies already cooperated with the Hertha Firnberg Schools in the last years. \r\nStudents complete a compulsory internship in upmarket hotels and restaurants in the course of their education. Internships in foreign countries are seen as highly significant at the Hertha Firnberg Schools, since they constitute an excellent preparation for the occupation-related practical as well as theoretical training, and the so-called \u00ab Vorpr\u00fcfung zur Reife- und Diplompr\u00fcfung \u00bb (exam that is part of the actual school leaving exam/equivalent to A levels, but which is taken one year earlier , i.e. at the end of the fourth year). It is character-forming and helps students develop their linguistic as well as intercultural competence. \r\nThe professional preparation of the interns for the internships abroad is done in the practical as well as theoretical occupation-related courses. The teachers have all gained international experience in the hospitality industry. Pupils are trained in restaurant service as well as in the kitchen to be prepared to work in upmarket hotels and restaurants. A training at the reception desk is also part of the curriculum. The linguistic as well as intercultural competence are taught in the language courses as well as in the optional course for intercultural competence. Students practice simple every-day conversations and complex professional situations by doing role plays. They also get special support by native speaker teachers.\r\nIn order to anchor the spirit of the idea of European mobility in our students\u2019 as well as their parents\u2019 heads, a yearly information evening takes place at our school. The students and their parents get to know about the advantages of the Erasmus + programme and receive necessary practical information in order to successfully participate in this programme. This possibility is also actively promoted at our open days, our parents\u2019 evenings for the third and fourth forms as well as at our introductory evening concerning exchange programmes. In addition to that, an informational event, which presents the possibility of completing an internship while also profiting from the Erasmus+ scholarship, is organised. The integration of partner schools should motivate them to carry out their own projects in the future, with support of the present project coordinator, who would provide her expertise and experience. \r\nUndoubtedly, students having completed an internship abroad have acquired a high level of linguistic, technical as well as personal competence. Thus the quality of the final practical and theoretical exams (\u201eVorpr\u00fcfung zur Reifepr\u00fcfung\u201c and \u201eA-level\u201c) rises significantly.
