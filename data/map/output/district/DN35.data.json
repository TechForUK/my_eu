Key to the evaluation process will be reports from the participants which will benchmark what learning objectives have been achieved and which will be compared and contrasted against the participants' intended outcomes prior to the commencement of the mobility utilising questionnaires received post-selection for the programme. Tables will be prepared to analyse the relative % success rates against each specific outcome. In addition all feedback from the participants, partners and management team will be collated and used to improve any future mobilities undertaken. The programme will be targeted at benefiting participants who are disadvantaged in the labour market which by virtue of the competitiveness of professional football the learners inevitably are.  Often players come from socially deprived areas, have learning difficulties and have limited interest or ability in academic education. Each participant will benefit from improved employability, enhanced career progression and greater job security following the mobility. A key objective for participants is that they will benefit from up-skilling and improved employability and so GTSET will track participants' employment history for a period of three years, updated annually, following the mobility in order to establish key data and trends regarding the direct correlation between a successful European mobility and improved employability. In addition GTSET teams' performance will similarly be measured annually for a period of 3 years following the mobility. The Project Manager, Graham Rodger - Community Manager will be key to the evaluation process. Knowing the candidates personally and being on the mobility he will be able to provide a balanced judgment in relation to individual benefits and enhanced learning for each participant. Following the mobility both participants and the partner organisations will be required to produce a final report identifying project outcomes and areas for improvement of future mobilities, critically assessing skills acquisition, language training and cultural integration.All parties' contributions will be correlated in an overall report evaluating the merits of the project in relation to the learning objectives and outcomes as well as identifying areas for improvement for subsequent coaching study visits within the EU. This final evaluation report will be publicised on the GTSET website.", "http://www.grimsbytownfitc.co.uk", "Grimsby Town Football in the Community Sports and Education Trust", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-013120_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN35"}
