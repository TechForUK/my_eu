Rats and mice carry over 70 diseases that can be transmitted to humans, they also cause economic damage to crops, buildings and infrastructure that runs into billions of Euro\u2019s per year. The rat population of the world is expanding rapidly and our current control systems are just not effective. All of the current electro mechanical devices have a carbon footprint with daily visits to remove dead animals and rest / re bait them. The toxins (eg warfarin) also require frequent visits to check on consumption and to re-bait.There is therefore a global need for a reliable, effective, safe, robust, economic pest control device.\nThrough the integration of new technologies proposed in part by the 4 participating SME organisations and with outsourced research capacity of European leading RTD performers, The PIED PIPER project aims to develop a new generation pest control device that will overcome the limitation of existing approaches in an environmentally, cost effective manner.", 479291.0, 1297255.0, "PIEDPIPER", null, null, null, null, "http://www.biotronics.net", null, "fp7_101252_998727521"], ["9NE", "Method for improving the quality of frozen foods by assisting the freezing process and reducing the size of the ice crystals", "Biotronics Ltd", "Freezing is a very widespread process within the food processing industry, being used not only to manufacture products that are consumed in frozen state, such as ice cream, frozen yoghurts, sorbets, etc, but also as a very important means of preserving fresh foodstuffs. However, freezing animal and plant tissues causes many irreversible physical and chemical changes within the food matrix, often leaving the final product with lower eating quality than when it was in the fresh state. Ice crystals represent one of the key contributors to quality degradation in frozen foods. As they grow in size, they exert additional stresses on fragile cellular structures and can damage emulsions and lead to negative product characteristics such as poor appearance, unacceptable texture and physical and nutritional product damage. In short, smaller ice crystals promote a better quality product and control of the crystal size distribution in the final product is one of the most important aspects for many freezing operations.  As quality issues take increasing precedence among EU consumers, a key challenge facing frozen food manufacturers is how to reposition their products as health-friendly. Consumers not only instinctively believe that fresh food tastes better than frozen food- they also see frozen foods as cheap and inferior. In response, this project will build upon promising research in the ability of high powered ultrasound (HPU) to initiate ice nucleation and to control crystal size distribution in the frozen product during solidification of liquid food. Past research has also shown promise for HPU to shorten the freezing process and lead to a product of better quality. This project will design and develop a prototype HPU system for its industrial validation in food freezing facilities. It will be cost-effective and easy to operate and easily integrated with commercially available freezing equipment.", 166143.0, 1231921.0, "MINICRYSTAL", "Ultrasonics and better frozen foods", "Ultrasonics can modify ice crystals as food freezes. Smaller crystals mean better preservation of the food's structure, taste and quality.", "Freezing is widely used in food production industries as a means of preserving perishable foods. However, ice crystals resulting from freezing often damage food cells, resulting in lowered quality and taste, and also giving frozen food a poor reputation. The bigger the crystals, the worse the damage.\n\nHowever, this can be controlled, thanks to the EU's funding of the http://www.ttz-bremerhaven.de/en/research/food/research-projects/899-minicrystal.html (MINICRYSTAL) project. Started in 2008 and concluded in 2010, it included nine partners, three research agencies and six small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and represented five countries. High-powered ultrasound (HPU) had been shown to reduce the size of ice crystals in food during the freezing process. MINICRYSTAL aimed to develop a prototype industrial system capable of that, and which could be industrially validated, easy to operate and simply integrated with existing systems.\n\nInitial research using HPU during food freezing showed 19\u201322\u00a0% reductions in crystal size in carrots and up to 25\u00a0% in meats. The project also achieved up to 28\u00a0% reduction in 'drip loss' for the same foods. Both measures show improved retention of food microstructure and reduction in cellular damage, meaning enhanced frozen food quality. The work yielded recommendations for the ultrasound parameters to be used in the prototype system.\n\nThe prototype was constructed and consists of a treatment bath and ultrasound equipment, plus conveyor belt and software control systems. As intended, it was compatible with existing commercial systems. After construction and testing, the prototype system was installed in a plant in Bremerhaven, Germany. Thorough testing on sample foods resulted in the same outcome as for the test phase: better frozen food produced with ultrasound, especially for chicken.\n\nFurther testing remains to be done for other types of foods, but MINICRYSTAL has established its system's effectiveness. It was assessed as giving robust, safe performance with strong commercial potential. Besides the frozen products, MINICRYSTAL technology will also result in energy savings and expanded production capacity for SMEs.

Indeed the global distribution of the disease has reached unprecedented levels with more countries reporting dengue fever cases.\n\nCurrently, there are no therapies or vaccines available and clinical management of the disease mainly entails careful monitoring and use of intravenous fluid therapy. The activities of the EU-funded 'International research consortium on dengue risk assessment, management, and surveillance' (http://www.idams.eu/ (IDAMS)) project will address the need for new diagnostic and clinical tools for dengue fever management.\n\nThe consortium will rely on clinical and laboratory parameters as well as viral and immunological biomarkers to differentiate between dengue and other common illnesses. IDAMS will also concentrate on mapping dengue disease globally and evaluating possible scenarios of spread to other regions in the future. Equally important is the development of effective and affordable early warning and outbreak response systems.\n\nIDAMS is studying patients with dengue fever to identify clinically useful correlates of severe dengue along with markers that detect disease evolution to severe forms. Innovative diagnostic tools are currently being developed to enhance the efficacy, sensitivity and speed of dengue fever detection. Active research into an effective vaccine is also underway and one of the project milestones is to delineate the mechanisms of protective immunity.\n\nConsiderable efforts have gone into outbreak prediction. IDAMS members reviewed current practices in dengue surveillance systems and their impact on dengue control. By combining epidemiological data from different countries they generated a disease prediction model. Based on this model, the major risk factors seem to be the temperature, the presence of dengue cases and the age of dengue-infected individuals.\n\nAlongside vector distribution maps, climatic and socioeconomic data, this information will provide estimates on the global distribution of dengue fever up to the year 2080. Such data should also help in developing better tools, policies and guidelines to prevent or contain dengue transmission.

It comprises a novel pest control device (PCD) incorporating an aerosol that delivers a metered dose of toxin onto the back of the rodent sufficient to kill in one application. The toxin passes through the skin and a quick and humane death results within 48 hours (compared to weeks with currently available products) to ensure that future populations of rodents will not develop resistance to the new toxin. This is a breakthrough versus the current multi-feed anticoagulants that are creating a growing problem of highly toxin resistant rodents (super rats).
