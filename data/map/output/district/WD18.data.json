The teachers will be aiming at taking nationally/internationally recognized examinations in Spanish to validate their progress. \r\n\r\nAs a school, we aim at providing outstanding teaching in all languages, including Spanish which is a fairly recent addition to the range of languages taught. The training will enable participants:\r\n-  to improve their language competence and knowledge of local culture which will benefit classroom teaching.\r\n- to learn about teaching methods in Spain and other countries through their experience at the language school abroad and to share what they have learnt with colleagues at home.\r\n- to develop contacts abroad through eTwinnings and other means of communication in order to continue to exchange best practice in language teaching as well as ideas for developing the international aspect of the curriculum across the school\r\n- to disseminate the knowledge acquired through the delivery of Insets and share resources through the school intranet.\r\n- to participate in the development of school policy, contributing ideas to include an international aspects to the curriculum and cross curriculum/pastoral projects.", "http://www.watfordgrammarschoolforgirls.org.uk", "Watford Grammar School for Girls", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-001965_coordinator"], ["8PX", "Discover Europe - \"Mehr Azubis ins Ausland\"", "Kodak Limited", 32479.0, "The particpants of the project 'Discover Europe - \"More trainees abroad\"' are 25 trainees. The students can decide in which year of the training their internship takes place and most of them acquire their internships in the European regions covered by ERASMUS+ autononomously. Further partners of the project are local companies, our European twin schools in France, Spain and Poland as well as our twin towns Scarborough (UK) and Ostroda (Poland).  The aim of this project is to meet the  increasing demand of trainees with work experience abroad. Not only can the students learn the theoretical aspects of their training but also can they experience the real working life abroad. Furthermore both the language and the intercultural skills which require openness and empathy towards different living and working conditions abroad are of special importance.\r\n\r\nBy doing an internship in the EU our trainees will have a competitive advantage in German companies  and thus concerning their professional competency. As a lot of them are forced to leave our structually weak region after their traineeship this is of particular relevance. Just as all of our projects since the year 2000 this project is aiming both at sustainability and at encouraging the willingness to mobility. Since the 2008 flow local companies have tended to be interested in arranging their trainees\u2019 internship within their company structure and they have taken on less interns from other companies. This is why the twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and the twin schools of the Leonardo da Vinci Mobility Project play an important part in putting the trainees in contact with companies abroad.\r\n\r\nThe mobilities take place in the Easter, summer and autumn holidays. First the applicants have to hand in a motivational letter and a Europass CV. After intense interviews we implement an intercultural training block course individually matched to the participants in order to prepare the mobility. Before the departure there is a meeting where the learning contract and the Europass mobility are set up. While being abroad the trainees are required to send short status reports to the project managers via email. The quality management is effected by means of reflection and evaluation sheets. Additionally the realised internships are assessed by a presentation at school in the vocational classes and a report published on our homepage. Non-satisfactory aspects of the internship are examined and improved in the next travel period.\r\n\r\nMoreover we enable our trainees to adapt their professional and social skills so as to attune them to Europe as a potential workplace. Concerning their academic performance the participants are predominantly good or very good students. We therefore expect them, above all, to act independently regarding the acquisition of the internship as well as the organization of accommodation, departure and arrival. The local companies support their trainees very well. What is more, there is a regular coordination with the project managers Ms V\u00f6lkel-Wipke and Ms Wertheim. This was the basis for the development of a network between our school, the local companies and the partner companies within the European Union. Last but not least there will be long-term synergy effects for the cooperation with our twin towns Scarborough and Ostroda and for the consolidation of the relationship with our European twin schools.", "http://www.kodak.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE02-KA102-004818_4"], ["0JT", "Sector Skills Alliance for Advanced Manufacturing in the Transport Sector", "EXCELLENCE, ACHIEVEMENT & LEARNING LTD", 802355.0, "The Sector Skill Alliance for Advanced Manufacturing in the Transport Sector represents the one-stop-shop providing state of the art solutions to competencies and skills needs faced by the automotive, aerospace and train industries.The Sector Skills Alliance is promoted by a network of leading organizations, including Jaguar Land Rover and SAS, Scandinavian Airlines Systems, in cooperation with research centres and accreditation and regulatory bodies.
