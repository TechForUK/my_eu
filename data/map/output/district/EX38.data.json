In our experience these contacts can open a chance for children's development even if they have different abilities and to consolidate their European consciousness.\r\n\r\nOur aim is an improvement of our educaters' English to enable more of them to work comprehensively in our cooperation with our partner school and our school exchange. We intend to ensure an appropriate care for all children, also those with special needs. The children shall be accompanied by well acquainted caregivers also on their visits at our partner school.\r\n\r\nAnother aim is the development of higher methodological skills of our English teachers to strengthen them for a teaching including remedial education for underachieving children and accelerated challenges for talented children.\r\n\r\nOur third aim is a professional interchange about educational practise between both schools.\r\n\r\nWe intend to send 14 educators to structured training courses. Four of them are English teachers who teach mainly in classe 3 to 6, four are class teachers and three are educators who are also responsible for the classes. Furthermore there are two special pedagogues and the headteacher.\r\n\r\nThe teachers and educators take part in English language courses, the English teachers attend combined language and methodological courses.\r\n\r\nSix educators will be sent in to visit our partner school to learn about their teaching practise. Four of them are teachers, two are educators. The aspiration of their attendence is to compare practise at both schools, to learn from each other and to implement good practise. Specific targets for this visits will be agreed before and reviewed afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe expect a progress in our educators' language skills and to improve the quality of teaching also considering inclusion especially in cooperation with our English partner school and contact to schools in other European countries.\r\nWe want to strengthen and extnd the cooperation with our partners long-acting.
