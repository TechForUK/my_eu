It\u2019s a way for people to assess their skills and qualities, consider their aims in life and set goals in order to realize and maximize their potential. Early life development and early formative experiences within the family, at school, etc. can help to shape us as adults, personal development should not stop later in life.  This project is designed to help young people to think about their personal development and ways in which they can work towards goals and their full potential.\r\n\r\n2. Training Course - \u201cEmpathy for Change\u201d (10 - 17 July, 2015)\r\nDuring the training we will provide participants frames and tools of empathic communication & conflict transformation, that they can use first of all for their personal life, and secondly to improve their social work and engagement. \r\nEmpathic communication focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as listening to another with deep compassion), and honest self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically in a way that is likely to inspire compassion in others). During the project will be analyzed dynamics of conflicts, but they will not be approached directly neither politically. Participants will get some keys and will be offered new perspectives with which to look and work on them, on their own, all lifelong. Through the words of those that are dedicating or have dedicated part of their life to conflict resolution, participants will get extremely useful instruments of challenges and achievements in peacebuilding. \r\n\r\nThis 2 level project helps to identify the skills needed to set life goals which can raise the confidence of young participants, enhance their employability prospects, develop their communication skills, how they relate with themselves & others and will lead to a more fulfilling, higher quality life.  Plan to make relevant, positive and effective life choices and decisions for their future to enable personal empowerment.\r\n\r\nMain aims & objectives of the project:\r\n\u2022 To stimulate the self-development process of young participants;\r\n\u2022 To assist them to \u201cget out of the box\u201d, enlarge their \u201ccomfort zone\u201d, maximize their creativity and see themselves and everything around as a possibility;\r\n\u2022 To give the tools of empathic communication and conflict transformation for their daily life and work;\r\n\u2022 To get intercultural experience by meeting with the representatives of different countries, cultures, backgrounds, religions, practice tolerance and break stereotypes & prejudices;\r\n\u2022 To build meaningful relations and future cooperation on the basis of this project under Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nThe team of trainers working on this project have a huge background in this field and have been implementing many projects for young people around the world. The methodology is based on learning by doing, which refers to the process of making meanings from direct experience. The method has been implemented by the concepts of learning by thinking and learning by loving. Learning by thinking denotes the action of reflecting on the process going on, in order to get knowledge from it. Finally, learning by loving expresses the importance given to motivation and passion that enrich the learning experience. The methodology is based on the concepts of developing and challenging individuals and groups through a creative stimulation that connects objective contents with personal experience and internalization. The exercises (called \u2018processes\u2019) may involve talking, while in another participants will be listening or visualizing certain thoughts. Exercises will be provided in combination with music, dance or play.

The training course is based on the principle that taking health care through environmnt and sports is instrumental in strengthening and enhancing civic behaviour and a feeling of belonging to a common European community which again leads to a reinforcement and empowerment of democracy in our civil society. \r\nThe training course will be based on the principles and practise of non-formal education and it will be focused in a way to allow a learner-centred approach taking into account the needs, interests and the experiences of the participants. \r\n\r\nThe project will take place in Reggio Calabria from 4th-11th March 2015 and it will involve 28 young participants coming from Italy, Poland, Georgia, Austria, Romania, Latvia, UK, Sweden, Arzebaijan, Ukraine, Armenia and Macedonia with high profile or interest in  healthy lifestyle, environment, sports and non-formal education. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the exchange are: \r\n1.

This gives a youth unemployment rate of 23.0 %. It should also be recorded here that there are no appreciable difference in neighbouring EU countries as lots of young people in these regions wait anxiously to migrate into EU thereby causing more unemployment challenges. \r\n\r\nYouths unemployment and exclusion from economic main stream in EU and neighbouring EU countries demands a strategic review, with commitment to contribute to EU's strategic aim at reducing youth unemployment, increase youth-employment rate in line with the wider EU target of achieving a 75% employment rate.\r\n\r\nThe  international project - \u201cCollaborative Economy for Youth Work\u201d is a two-level ERASMUS+ project, that fights against the pessimistic view of the current situation, which leads young people to social exclusion, and presents itself as an opportunity to develop new attitudes, presenting social and business actions that can contribute to change, in time when these are extremely necessary.\r\n\r\nThere is a Spanish proverb that says \u201chunger sharpens the wit\u201d, that can explain the big repercussion and growth of a new movement called \u201ccollaborative consumption (CC)\u201d or \u201csharing economy\u201d. For example we can find barter trade markets, car/bike/house sharing, coworking, crowdfunding, couchsurfing, peer to peer lending and renting, even virtual currencies. But what happens if we introduce this concept in the field of youth work? Can we meet the needs that the actual economic situation has created, and use these new methodologies of sharing to improve the quality of the youth work projects? The answer is YES!  CC is quate new tool in youth work and thats why we would like to implement this project to make it grow and get bigger and bigger. \r\n\r\nThe projects contains 2 levels, first TC and second Youth Exchange.  The project  will analyze the sharing movement and equip youth workers with new tools that will help them to use these platforms in concrete projects at local and international level.\r\n\r\n1. TC - \"Collaborative consumption, New word in Youth work\" takes place in Manchester, UK during 10 - 16th of April, 2015. The training is  about -  collaborative consumption (CC) - the new class of economic arrangements, where the participants share access to products or services, rather than having individual ownerships. CC especially in times of crisis, is the perfect tool that could be used also for youth work.   the 1st stage of the project - TC - is more concentrated on giving information about different types and methods of shared economy, on the 2nd stage (YE) the most motivated and active participants of the TC will be leaders of YE.  \r\n\r\n2. YE - \"Sharing Unites Everyone\" takes place in Bakuriani, Georgia, during 10-17 May, 2015. After the 1st stage the participants will get the task to experiment different models of CC in their lives and work. Especially important part for YE will be financial contribution of \"Crowd funding\" realized by the participants themselves. On YE the most of the participants will already have some experience of Sharing Economy and the aim of the project is to promote CC, implement in practice some of the models during the project, produce the manual - \"CC for youth work\" and spread it widely, in order to give possibility to other youngsters, youth workers and associations to use the same opportunities.\r\n\r\nIts a fact that Collective Consumption has already entered into youngsters' live in Europe. They move using carsharing or bikesharing, use couchsurfing instead of a hostel,  use exchange platforms, buy second hand goods, instead of renting an office , fund their books, videos,  maybe is just a minority but is growing fast. CC creates big curiosity between youngsters and not only, is trendy; as is new, interactive and playful and is a perfect way to promote active citizenship and rise environmental awareness between youngsters. It is very important for partner countries, where most of those models do not even exist, or are replaced by traditional system.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to:\r\n\u2022Raise awareness towards CC and promote its idea\r\n\u2022Promote use of CC tools in youth work and create the manual\r\n\u2022Work on and practice the concept of collective sharing,CC, social economy\r\n\u2022Provide creative and innovative tools against the crisis\r\n\u2022Strengthen entrepreneurship, creativity and initiative of youth\r\n\u2022Share the best practices of youth work and NFE\r\n\u2022Promote intercultural exchange, tolerance and solidarity\r\n\u2022Prepare future YE leaders\r\n\u2022Promote Erasmus+ and cooperation between EU & partner countries\r\n\u2022Build new partnerships\r\n\r\nProject methodology is based on non-formal education and peer to peer education, valorizing the knowledge and experiences of the youngsters.\r\nCountries involved in project: Georgia, UK, Germany, Spain, Poland, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon", "http://www.vision2020leadershipinitiative.btik.com", "V2020 (VISION 2020 LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE)", "erasmus_2014-3-UK01-KA105-011974_coordinator"], ["7GD", "ENGAGING YOUTHS IN ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP", "V2020 (VISION 2020 LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE)", 24597.0, "Interest: EU and Neighbouring EU countries  partnership is a progressive concept, in line with new wave of patriotism among  youths globally who yearn for political and social change, knowledge and drive towards active engagement in their local communities, regions, and countries, 'EYAC' is apt to elicit curiosity and interest of youths as change makers/agents in their respective communities.\r\n\r\nMethods: Non formal training process will involve use of role plays. exercises, games, film making, drama etc to engage participants.

It will be kind of personal development course for youngsters who are just in the way of choosing future professions and they will get sessions which will help them to develop their career; give them basic skills how to write CV and motivation letter, how to make self presentation, how to act during the interview. they will learn importance of leadership and team work, creativity, time management and project management. they will try to work with peers with fewer opportunities, they will sea the advantage of inclusion and cooperation. At the end of each stage (TC or YE) they will have chance to plan future projects together and work on the most problematic issues they face in their society. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of the TC are:\r\n\u2022 To promote Erasmus+\r\n\u2022 Help youngsters develop themselves as active citizens and future youth workers\r\n\u2022 To reduce the youth unemployment;\r\n\u2022 To promote integration/inclusion\r\n\r\nTraining Course (First Stage) \"Development for Employment\" will bring together 27 youngsters from 8 different countries  with the aim to help newly graduated youngsters to gain basic knowledge about very useful things, for example: how to write CV and motivation letter, how to make self presentation and presentation in general; how to act during interview; main aspects of  leadership and team work, creativity, time management and project management. they will have chance to plan, participate and learn about different youth activities, which is helping them to develop.  During the training Course they will be informed about all the activities which can be implemented under Erasmus + and they will be able to be actively involved in this program. At the same time they will see real examples how active citizenship and volunteering can be useful. hosting organization will arrange a meeting with youth workers, ex- volunteers who had started to be very active in different fields and during this process made  important personal contacts which later helped them to get job offers. It will be a sharing of best practice. \r\n\r\nYouth Exchange (Second stage)  \"Integration+\" will bring together 40 youngsters from 8 different countries and the main target group will be youngsters with fewer opportunities. the most active and motivated participants of TC will come as leaders, but in each group there will be at least 2 people with fewer opportunities. Ex- participants of TC  will have chance to use theoretical background of the TC and share it with others.  Than all participants of YE will be able to lead same kind of sessions in Schools of rural areas of Georgia. it will be a good example of peer education.  besides it is very important to say that youngsters coming from orphan houses are having even more obstacles in the way of employment. In Georgian reality mainly they are learning how to make handmade souvenirs, but it is also big challenge to reach the users. So, participants of YE will teach them how to make good project out of good idea, how to implement it and with the help of organizers they will make exhibition/festival/market of their handmade souvenirs.  as a result participants of YE will learn how to create beautiful and unique things with their own hands and also they will use their knowledge of project development in practice. they will be in charge of implementation this idea with the monitoring of organizers. \r\nThe learning methods of project will be through non-formal and in-formal education.

Youth Exchange \u2013 \"Dance for Europe\" - about cultural similarities & diversities in Europe and neighboring countries, mostly expressed by dancing. \r\n\r\nFor both of the projects the promoter organizations will be the same.

As mentioned above, the most active participants from previous TC will be group leaders and actively involved in organization process of this YE.\r\nIn order to reach project aims, we chose more particular topic for the project - dancing. The main purpose of dancing is expressing yourself, trying to make what you feel a visible thing; we can dance for health and exercise benefits, as a spiritual expression or simply to connect socially.\r\nMore and more young people are closed in apartments sit in front of computers and infinitely major games that have little to do with real life. Once gathered together on a project in Georgia, we are thinking about how to show young people how easy , simple and fun you can lead a healthy lifestyle. Our project is about dancing ! To learn how to sport his/her own body, breath sports discipline can be with a smile, without much difficulty.\r\nHere are seven main reasons that are clear evidence of the benefits of Dance:\r\n1. Promoting health - Modern medicine claims that dance classes are optimal training for the heart , blood vessels, muscles and joints. \r\n2 . Correct and beautiful posture - In today's world in more than 50 % of people have back problems . Due to these problems disappear dance and develops a correct posture\r\n3 . Beautiful , elegant gait - An important factor in the formation of the external image of man is his manner of walking.\r\n4 . Sense of rhythm and musicality development\r\n5 . External beauty and good mood - Dancing will open you the secret of how the \"gray mouse\" turned into a mysterious and attractive man. Thanks to a new view of the hair, clothes , and even for women and make you feel that now is not deprived of the attention of others who simply can not tear away from you admiring glances.\r\n6.

These young people who are or will be involved in the Erasmus+ programme develop their competences as perfect future youth leaders. Project Create peace through leadership is based on the belief that group leaders of youth are capable to develop and increase the quality of Erasmus+ youth exchanges by finding adequate models to truly motivate youth to actively take part in the youth exchange and they can gain new skills and knowledge. The main goal is to enable group leader to act not as teacher but with real motivation playing an active role of a facilitator who successfully involves and motivates young people. Following this model, the people assisting youngsters during international projects are supporting, with a step by step guide, to also reach the aims of the European Union and its core values. \r\n\r\nThe training course has been designed based on the actual needs of the partners after several skype meetings and successful previous cooperation. Very often youth workers use the same old methods during their work and this can lower the quality and progress of the youth exchanges. Therefore we have the need to improve and also assist the improvement of other youth leaders. The projects aims to help recent or future group leaders to develop their competences and become active in the field of international youth work. We promote and will facilitate an active and already working approach which will support youth leaders to come up with creative ideas and find new appropriate models to motivate, support youth, provide appropriate learning support, to stimulate young people\u2019s spirit of initiative, creativity and entrepreneurship. Youth leaders will improve their strategies for motivating youth in their local realities and on international projects and through their self-evaluation find new ideas and tools for future projects.  Participants will have an opportunity to come up with appropriate models aimed at involving youngsters to start work and be proactive in their communities proactively. The project aims to achieve it by bringing back the youth leader to his first steps and facilitate their self-assessment as a group leader. By using interactive and non-formal methods (brainstorming, group works, theater, simulation, role play, open group discussion, open space for reflection etc), the participants will become fully involved in the project itself and will increase their needs and develop their leadership skills and practical knowledge. The exact methods are adapted by the trainers based on the selected participants\u00b4 profiles to guarantee successful learning process of each participants especially those with fewer opportunities. All participants will be also highly involved in all parts of the project by preparing their country realities for situation of youth exchanges and facilitation in their organisations. \r\n\r\nThe project Create peace through leadership will have a clear and effective impact on the partner organizations who will be involved in the project. The participating network of organizations has the aim to develop skills and knowledge of participants from different countries, open their mind and give them a chance to discuss issues that really affect them and their youth work.  Since the group leaders are prepared to work within an international environment it is also important to give them an international environment to apply their skills. Therefore project seeks to not only improve the qualities of future youth exchanges but also has the aim to provide a platform for facilitating cooperation between organizations and their networks. Therefore we clearly believe that the participants of this training course will later create youth exchanges of a better quality under the Erasmus+ program.", "http://www.vision2020leadershipinitiative.btik.com", null, "erasmus_2018-2-HU01-KA105-048016_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "M18"}
