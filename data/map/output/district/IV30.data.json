There is a need for Youth Workers and Educators of Youth to not only support the mental wellbeing of the young people they work with, but to also equip those young people with the knowledge and skills they need to manage difficulties that may arise within their peer groups, as research has shown. The Mental Health Champions program proposes supporting young people through the training of Youth Workers and Educators of Youth by giving them tools to learn and understand mental health awareness from a practical standpoint. 30 Youth Workers, and Educators of Youth, from eight organisations across seven European countries will come together to share the challenges of youth and their mental health and develop tools that allow them support and educate the young people they work with. Using non-formal, experiential methods, participants will be given the opportunity to explore and improve their personal mental health knowledge. They will be given tools to create strategies for seeking information and managing concerns they might have for another person. A space will be provided to allow participants openly and freely discuss any fears or myths they may have concerning mental ill health. Participants will be taught the importance of self care and strategies that may be employed should they find they are overwhelmed or unsure how to manage any situation they may find themselves in. \r\n\r\nThe programme has 3 simple aims:\r\n\r\n1. \tProvide Youth Workers and Educators of Youth with the competencies to create a space where young people can openly and safely discuss the difficulties that they, as a group, identify for themselves.\r\n \r\n2. \tProvide Youth Workers and Educators of Youth with strategies that support young people in knowing where to find information should they need it and that this information is empirical and youth friendly.\r\n \r\n3. \tProvide Youth Workers and Educators of Youth with tools to inform young people of the skills to enable them to have conversations with someone they are concerned is having difficulties and what to do to support that person. \r\n\r\nThe impact of the programme for participants will be confidence in using the tools gained through the programme that will allow them develop the mental health awareness of young people they work with. It is hoped that this programme is the beginning of a network of European organisations, working in the area of youth, that can share their skills and experiences of developing young people\u2019s mental health.", "http://www.moraywellbeinghub.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IE01-KA105-038747_4"], ["1JJ", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "Moray College UHI", 22409.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.moray.uhi.ac.uk", "Moray College UHI", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046974_coordinator"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["1BX", "Poverty & Social Inclusion Operation Moray", "The Moray Council", "Support to low income households and people from workless households addressing low level incomes and high levels of debt within Moray.", "ESF", 121544.0, 243088.0, "esf_scotland_150"], ["1BX", "Employability Moray Operations and Admin", "The Moray Council", "Administrator will be employed by The Moray Council.
