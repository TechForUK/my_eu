As a large role in this, Claire Smith, a class teacher and language ambassador for the school wishes to take part in a mobility project provided by LFEE Europe - a week long immersion course in Lyon, France in October 2016. Claire, at present, has basic skills in French and is open to new ideas. She enjoys being creative and is enthusiastic about bringing the teaching of French forward at Dales Park.Taking part in the immersion course would primarily mean a deeper insight into French is gained which allows for staff confidence and competency to be boosted. Through preparation for and immersion in the language throughout the course, Claire would build upon her own French talking, listening and writing skills. Importantly, we wish for Claire to gain new ideas surrounding ideas and methodologies and resources to strengthen all of our class teacher's pedagogy in relation to regular, planned exposure to French throughout the school. As well as developing cultural awareness and gaining physical resources to take back to school on the course, Claire would also open up channels for communication between Scottish and French schools. We would also like the use of ICT to be integrated into this aspect of schools connecting,  making use of e-resources, portals and eTwinning. In preparation and as part of the school's development plan for 1+2, Claire has already began attending methodology teaching French to young learners courses and trying out ideas with her infant class, has organised information sessions and meetings with school staff to feedback information and discuss the school's immediate next steps as well as up skilling her own French using apps and interactive resources. The class teachers are planning to begin trialling some of our already discussed strategies and resources within their classes gradually from now. Claire has planned to involve parents and the local community in the process of implementing 1+2 languages at Dales Park School. During the week long immersion course, Claire will partake in a number of language development classes, cultural trips, resource sharing/exchanging opportunities,  language development day to day opportunities and visits to local French primary schools. On returning from the immersion course, Claire has planned to share her experiences with the local community - staff and pupils, as well as regionally in cluster groups throughout Aberdeenshire Council.

Staff will have new, innovative ideas to try with the pupils and will be motivated to teach French embedded in other parts of the curriculum as their own language knowledge grows. Different active methods of teaching will be used and a direct source of information will be available through ICT connections and resources brought back from Lyon. Established links will keep the children motivated and their understanding of the general progression of all languages will be improved through progression in French. We will have a better understanding in the progression though oral French through to phonics and eventually writing. Pupils will enjoy French being a part of the school and will be motivated to talk to each other in the language, after joyfully recognising their own success in understanding French instructions and meaningful display words. The learning will be centered around the children and their interests which aids with engagement for all. Transition of language learning to secondary schools will be enhanced.

That\u2019s why the board of Directors has proposed a mobility commission composed of parents, training managers, the director, and 2 others referents. The mobility team is composed of 4 teachers.\r\n\r\nThe aims are for the young people : improvement of the quality of the training so that they can be competitive on the job market ( open-minded, self-reliant, foreign languages improvement, discover other job opportunities). Otherwise, we expect that our students could change their mind concerning foreign population and that they could consider their way of live in an  European dimension. \r\nThis experience will give a good status to the school, and it will strengthen the links with the different territorial and institutional partners. The improvement of the training\u2019s quality is an advantage to ensure the sustainability of the school. Otherwise the structure develops its partners networks even abroad. Finally, the organisation of mobility projects creates an attractive communication development interesting for the school.\r\n\r\nThe project concerns our two classrooms of pupils in Bachelor degree, that\u2019s mean 33 pupils.

They are mainly living in rural area and lots of them haven\u2019t travelled in a foreign country before.\r\n\r\nOur previous different experiences showed us that it was important to prepare carefully the project in advance. The teaching of the MFR is in fact adapted to this type of project. Parents and training managers are involved in the organisation of mobility. The students take part in the logistical preparation (transport, accommodation, food, communication with the training manager.) The whole team of the MFR are mobilised to prepare the young people (foreign languages lesson, meeting with a native speaker, inquiries concerning the country). Next year we will follow carefully the mobility report.\r\n\r\nWe want that our student thanks to this experience change their mind concerning the world around them, that they can feel as European as French. To evaluate the impacts of the mobility, we will organise formal report time and compare with inquiries done before the mobility.

For this reason, we are filing two applications (Chartered and Unchartered) which together constitute our region-wide project \"Erasmob 4\" for the New Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nDriven by the Regional Federation of MFR New Aquitaine (FRMFR NA), this Chartered project is at the heart of our work on Mobility and brings together 11 establishments with diverse experiences of mobility (0 to 6 years).

These are:\r\n- improving key skills of young people to facilitate their socio-professional integration \r\n- offering quality training tailored to the needs of the territories, businesses and youth \r\n- strengthening partnerships to support the modernisation of our education system and our commitments towards Raising Awareness of Other people and Worlds (encouraging citizenship in our youth and our staff and heightening sensitivity to cultural differences, etc.)\r\n\r\nWe envisage the following activities for 2018-2020:\r\n- 446 in short Mobilities in work placements (3 weeks average) incorporating alternation courses for learners in basic training (including Ulis and disabled status), and apprenticeships. These young people from often remote environments with little mobility, are accompanied by trainers and employees, in accordance with the requirements of our ministry and the values of our Movement.\r\n- 6 long full immersion stays in enterprise (Erasmus Pro,> 90 days of work experience) for learners in further and continuing education + 4 preparatory Visits\r\n- 94 staff-training opportunities abroad (3 days to 3 weeks) for employees / administrators / French tutors in job-shadow.\r\n- 12 teaching abroad missions (about 1 week) welcoming trainers or foreign employees so they deliver thematic or language courses\r\n\r\nVarious partners in 11 European countries are called upon to welcome our students according to their field: farming, education, health, commerce, landscaping, etc.\r\n\r\nThe consortium\u2019s operation method, developed over the course several years, is based on the complementary work of the steering committee, technical committees, the FRMFR team coordinator and Mobility referents of our member establishments, brought together on training days.

In the meantime many new youth circus organizations with younger entrepreneurs and youth circus trainers emerged, bringing new approaches, new drives and fresh energy\u2026\r\nAt previous youth circus platform meetings of EYCO, a strong need was expressed to share expertise and knowhow on implementing more youth empowerment  and  participation in our organizations.
