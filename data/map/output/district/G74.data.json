We got to the conclusion that, given their features, short term EVS projects are a great opportunity to encourage young people in these situations.\r\nFourteen organizations from eight different countries working with young people with fewer opportunities and with EVS will participate in the seminar and we intend to promote short term EVS projects.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n- To promote international mobility of young people with fewer opportunities;\r\n- To establish new partnerships;\r\n- To exchange experience and good practice related to short term EVS projects;\r\n- To establish a medium-term network of projects about short term EVS for young people with fewer opportunities;\r\n- To develop a methodology for the inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities though EVS projects;\r\n- To improve the competences of the youth workers participating in this seminar.\r\n\r\nThe methodology that will be used will be adapted according to the participants; it will be dynamic and methods such as teamwork, moderated debates, presentations and brainstorming etc. will be used.

The project will involve hosting 10 volunteers,for a period of 29 days. The project will start in line with A&M Scotland's summer camps either from 1st July and 1st August 2017 and will be based in the city of Glasgow, United Kingdom with weekly project activities happening in Petershead and Kingsway community centers with over 250 young people. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to meet the needs for young European people to have an improved understanding of European and international activities such as EVS and to provide them with positive intercultural experiences through direct contact with volunteers from a range of backgrounds and lifestyles, including 82 nationalities of young people, many of whom are migrants and refugees. \r\n\r\nUsing non-formal educational methods the volunteers will take part in A&M Scotland's summer activities in Glasgow communities using sport as tool of engagement, create and disseminate promotional and information materials about their experience  that will seek to inform the local youth population of not only the opportunities available to them, but also the multiple benefits to them of participating in volunteering and intercultural activities on a local and international level. They will also take part in English languages lessons, led by young people who speak the same languages as them due to migrating to Scotland and will every day integrate and take part in project activities with A&M's local young people. \r\n\r\nAs a result it is expected that the level of understanding of volunteering and international opportunities, the intercultural understanding of the young people will increase, and their desire to participate in volunteering and lifelong learning opportunities shall all increase. It is also hoped that there will be an increase in the amount of young people with social and economic barriers taking part in such activities on return home and in the West of Glasgow, leading to an increase in the skills and experience, their intercultural competences, understanding of their role as active citizens and their participation in the democratic lives of their communities in the future.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a successful implementation of this project, the project shall also create new partnerships between a range of organisations in the field of youth development and also give young people with little to no aspirations, the opportunity to develop the confidence to one day, themselves, take part in an long term outward mobility activity like EVS or enter into further education, employment or education on return home after a series of after care.", "http://www.aandm.org.uk", "Achieve More Scotland", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035843_coordinator"], ["2LP", "Language Training", "Sanderson High School", 4056.0, "We are applying to support Rosemary Cuthbert and Anabel Prieto to attend an immersion course in France provided by Language for Education Europe. They plan to go together to Salignac. This immersion course will support Rosemary and Anabel in extending their skills and expertise in teaching French to children in Sanderson High School, a special needs school in South Lanarkshire. This is an application for two applicants who are very enthusiastic and have already some knowledge of the French language. Rosemary did the 12 week course on primary language learning delivered by LFEE and Anabel is studying French in the Open University. The LFEE immersion course will provide tuition, cultural activities, resources and copious opportunities to develop partnerships and professional connections.\r\n\r\nSanderson High School has embraced the 1+2 Language learning in the school. This strategy is being implemented across the authority and involves pupils being introduced to a second language from nursery until primary 7 and beyond. Pupils are also taught a third language in the early stages of their education. Our headteacher, Aisling Boyle, is committed to improving attainment across the curriculum and this includes the learning and teaching of modern languages. Anabel Prieto is a native of Spain, she is currently teaching Spanish to several classes in the school and plans to teach French to pupils from S1 to S6 in the near future. Rosemary Cuthbert has been teaching French for the last two and a half years to primary pupils with additional support needs. She attended the Languages For Education in Europe French teaching course and was an active member of the French steering group in her previous school. She wishes to continue teaching French as part of her professional development and is very interested in giving the experience of French teaching to pupils with complex learning difficulties.\r\n\r\nBy participating the LFEE immersion course, we hope that Rosemary and Anabel can return to school with more knowledge, skills and ideas to lead future whole school developments in French which build upon these projects and help us to achieve our improvement priority, and to embed languages across the school. Currently, our school has no links with European Projects or partnerships with French schools and so it is hoped that by taking part in this project; these important links can be made and the skills needed to maintain them will be created.  \r\n\r\nIn line with \"Teaching Scotland's Future\" (Donaldson Review) the immersion course will help Rosemary and Anabel to extend their understanding of modern languages through building links with teachers across Europe which they are looking forward to sharing with their colleagues. As a result there will be a stronger understanding of relevant pedagogy leading to improved learning and teaching.\r\n\r\nWhen Rosemary and Anabel return from this course, it is hoped that they will have much greater confidence and be up skilled in teaching French and, in the future, other modern languages. They will have gained an in-depth understanding of French culture and will become  more aware of cultural norms in contemporary France which will then be transfered to our staff, pupils and wider community. Anabel and Rosemary's newly gained knowledge, skills and expertise will ultimately improve teaching methodology for languages within our school and help us to reach our improvement priorities as well as meeting local authority and national policies and targets for primary language learning. Rosemary and Anabel's experience on this course will help us to embed French across our school and help us to move away from teaching French discreetly as a once a week lesson to a holistic model.  As part of the steering group they plan to label the school using dual language labels to begin with and move towards extending this to include our school's chosen third language. She will encourage all children across the school to refer to these labels on a daily basis. The course provider (LFEE) will provide Rosemary and Anabel with copious resources to return with, they plan to save these on a USB drive and then share them on our shared staff server on return to ensure widespread access and use across the school.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the ultimate goal of this project is to impact positively on the learning and teaching of French for our pupils in Sanderson High School and widen their cultural horizons.", "http://www.sandersonhighschool.co.uk", "Sanderson High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046992_coordinator"], ["5BA", "Mobilit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne dans le secteur de l\u2019h\u00f4tellerie et de la restauration", "Independent Training Consultants Ltd", 413854.0, "The project of our catering school insists on the importance of our European partner network and is historically oriented to Europe and International destinations. The main goal is to increase the employment opportunities for our students in the cookery and catering industry. This project concerns students preparing the equivalent of the BTECH in cooking and service and young graduates from less than a year.\r\nActivity 1:Students preparing their BTECH with a European option (40 students per level displayed in 7 classes) can improve their professional skills as well as their linguistic cultural and personnal skills thanks to an 8 week training period in one of our european hotel partners. Our network, created in 2004 consists now into a dozen high standard hotels in Scotland, Estonia, Ireland. It recently enlarged to Dublin in anticipation of the Brexit.\r\nThe students are undergoing a 3 year course Btech or 2 year course Btech in european option and are trained to be chefs or waiters ( cooking or service). Two mobility sessions are planned a year (september 2018, mars 2019, september 2019, march 2020).To ensure fairness among the students (chefs and waiters) and to meet our partners expectations, the selection of trainees is well balanced. The short term goals are to pass their BTECH with the European distinction thanks to the points given by the optional Mobility and european sp\u00e9cific exams, to obtain a Europass, and the cambridge certificate.\r\nOur activities are in 4 parts: \r\na) a linguistic  part with English lessons and DNL.\r\nb) a cultural part with european citizenship awareness and introduction to the cultural specificities of our european partners.\r\nc) a professionnal part to improve our students' skills in the catering industry.\r\nd) a personnal part to developpe autonomy, adaptability of the students and their skills in new technologies.\r\nThe students are welcome by our partners or providers collaborating with the coordinators. A weekly monitoring helps  to guide the students. 2 teachers assess the students in the host country, they ensure the continuation of the partnerships, they anticipate the next work placements and look for new hotel restaurants.\r\nThe European financing as well as the grants from the region, the school, the partners and the families guaranty the same opportunities for all students. The local press, departemental and national websites (HR), and social networks promote our european sections, which permitted 100% of students pass their Btech and a a majority continues their studies.\r\n\r\nActivity 2: it consists in a 5 months European and international mobility( 22 weeks) proposed to young graduates of less than 1 year stemming from hotel businesses catering and businesses by the food (supply) holders of a CAP (VOCATIONAL TRAINING QUALIFICATION,COURSE,CAPE), A BEP (A VOCATIONAL DIPLOMA), Vocational high school diploma. They are registered in a complementary (additional) training (formation) of local initiative ( F.C.I.L): adaptation to hotel businesses catering in Europe and on the international stage. Our students are native of Paris region, of province and some of foreign origin and arise for the most part of modest backgrounds and some have a light handicap.\r\nThey require a financial and logistic support, our objectives are to prepare our participants to adapt themselves to diverse enriching situations. The purpose is to favor their social and professional integration and to place them in an approach of training throughout life. This international dimension is likely to develop our attractiveness so much at level recruitment as occupational integration and so contribute to the excellent reputation of our trainings and to the outside brilliance of our high school. Our project is carried by a network rich in experiences and in hotel establishments situated in 15 European and foreign countries (Germany, Belgium, Great Britain, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Finland, The Northern Ireland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Scotland, and Turkey). It counts now 18 catering schools and training centers professional. It is thanks to the network that the proposed actions of mobility can become a reality, the diverse possible destinations are a real strength of attractiveness. With the aim of coordinating our actions (shares) and of extension our partnership, we organize an annual meeting during which define we our axes of action (share). The mobilities will take place from September 2018 for 5 months ( 22 weeks), the trainee will follow a preparation to condition (package) him/her in his future internship (training course) and will be placed in a company hotelkeeper. The follow-up is jointly insured by the high school of sending, the establishment of welcome (reception) and the guardian of internship (training course). The participation of The European Union remains vital to assure ( insure) the success of the project in which the families (relatives) participate at the level of 300\u20ac maximum.", "http://www.in-train.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047271_9"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G74"}
