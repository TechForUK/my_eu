The accessibility technologies we have are meeting the needs of only some, at high cost, and will not work with many new technologies. The path and pace of technological change predestines these approaches to fail in the very near future. At the same time the incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population ages.The same technical advances however hold the potential for a radical paradigm shift in our approach to accessibility that can harness the pace of innovation and have it work for us rather than against us. An international consortium is forming to tap the unprecedented ability to pool resources and match demand with supply enabled by the Cloud to build a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that can deliver accessibility to every individual where they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their unique requirements; automatically so that they do not need to negotiate, explain, qualify or justify.Cloud4All represents a European based effort to advance the GPII concept by pulling together a large multi-sector international community including stakeholders, industry leaders and experts in emerging technologies to thoughtfully research, design, develop and test the key software infrastructure and pilot implementations needed to explore this promising approach to digital inclusion. Cloud4All will do this by:-Creating/refining user profiling standards and tools capable of capturing the individual needs and preferences of the full range of users facing interface barriers-Creating/refining interface and materials profiling standards and tools capable of characterizing the full range of ICT/materials users need to access and the different techniques and strategies for accessing them-Improving mechanisms to match users and with interfaces and materials they can use or techniques or services that can make them usable-Creating a mechanism to allow users to locate solutions from many different sources in a single search-Demonstrating automatic, on-demand, matching or modification of mainstream and specialized technologies\u2028to match each individual as they encounter them, including proof-of-concept demonstrations of this approach across a spectrum of technologies including: Computer OSs and Browsers; Web pages/Apps; Mobiles; Kiosks/Info-Transaction Machines; Installed and Virtual Assistive Technologies; Digital Televisions and Smart Homes-Testing of the concept with users with a wide variety and combination of physical, sensory, cognitive, language, and learning disabilitiesIf successful, this approach may give us our first chance of reaching the large group of users that do not qualify for or otherwise have not been reached by special services, but nonetheless face barriers to access that prevent them from participating in our rapidly advancing digitally enabled society.", 63605.0, 10454611.0, "CLOUD4all", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_101353_963914318"], ["2RU", "Easy Reading: A Framework for Personalised Cognitive Accessibility when using Original Digital Content", "Texthelp Ltd", "The \u201cEasy Reading\u201d framework will improve the cognitive accessibility of original digital documents by providing real time personalisation through annotation (using e.g. symbol, pictures, videos), adaptation (using e.g. layout, structure) and translation (using e.g Easy-to-Read, Plain Language, symbol writing systems).

This duration provides enough time for the learner to become integrated into the host company and to discover new techniques without penalizing the French employer in his professional activity.\r\n\r\nThe staffs, as for them, will leave from 2 to 7 days for mobility in training centers and partner companies. \r\n154 apprentices and 37 accompanying persons will leave for mobility in Italy, Germany, Romania and Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Spain, The United Kingdom, Ireland \u2026: back to France, they will use the observations made in the partner country, to present their life in a company but also their everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis year we have developed the chapter \"scattering\" and \"valuation\" to take advantage of these experiences to speak about the project. Furthermore, we have launched a more elaborate quality approach to be sure of the relevance of the project and to maintain a reflexive approach.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, profits are multiple: an enrichment of the professional practices for the apprentices and the staffs, an interest generated within the teams and the learners around international exchanges, intercultural exchanges, valuation of the various actors involved in the project, which already impact on the participating establishments.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036978_2"], ["4PS", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 2553.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035486_coordinator"], ["4PS", "\u0160irimo obzorja", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 113611.0, "BIC Ljubljana is applying for a two-year mobility project for VET students and staff. With the project we are underlining the European dimension and direction of our educational centre. We implement programmes for technical/general upper secondary education, veterinary technicians, food processing and nutrition technicians, nature protection technicians, butchers, bakers, confectioners as well as lower secondary education (students with special needs). We will organize mobilities with 10 partners in the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Finland, Spain, Portugal and France. The choice of partners is based on the needs of individual vocational programme and positive experiences. With the project, we want to achieve general and specific goals related to the professions of the participants.\r\nThe students will gain and/or enrich generic competences such as: health and safety, environmental protection, ICT literacy, social competences, sense of fairness, ethics, career orientation and planning, entrepreneurship, independency, responsibility, ability to organize one\u2019s life abroad, ability to establish contact with citizens of another country, discovering cultural landmarks, learning a foreign language, learning for life.\r\nVeterinarian technicians want to develop students' teamwork skills and improve the level of skills in care for animals. To achieve this they will work in clinics in the UK, Ireland and in an animal shelter in Cyprus.\r\nNature protection technicians will work in Finland in a forestation or in a tree nursery.  They will get familiar with the usage of biomass.\r\nConfectioners will work in workshops in Spain, France and Portugal and will learn how to make local deserts. They will experience the communication process with clients and suppliers. Food processing and nutrition technicians will work in olive plantation (picking olives) and in olive oil processing in Spain. \r\n We organize the activities in cooperation with several partners. Some of them have been our partners for a number of years. The Spanish partner will host a larger number of food processing and nutrition technicians, since the work placements in the olive oil processing offered very good quality. Portuguese partner will host a large group of nature protection technicians, butchers, confectioners and biotechnology students. For the first time we are sending an entrepreneur to Finland. The activities are usually planned bilaterally so BIC Ljubljana also hosts students and staff from partner organizations.\r\nWe expect the project to be a positive influence for the participants as well as for our organization. Participants improve their generic and vocational competences and the organization will gain new European experience, staff and student motivation for work, new knowledge and skills to be included in the learning process. A long-term effect is also popularization of professions we train for (some of them are deficit) which means a sufficient number of students\u2019 registrations. Students\u2019 practical education is officially recognized and they receive Europass mobility. Teachers\u2019 experience is officially recognized with Europass, they receive extra points for promotion and a description of the gained experience in the work assessment. They include new experiences in the modernization of study programmes and new study materials. Teachers have a presentation for colleagues in pedagogical conference. \r\nThe students will gain a better position in labor market.

Since 2011, the CFA is launched in ERASMUS projects to develop the mobility of its apprentices. \r\nOur candidates for mobility are often participants with fewer opportunities.\r\nThe project ERASMUS + is a good way for our students to stand out and to gain a rewarding professional and personal experience. Over the years, the project has grown, associating and involving every year a growing number of UFA. In 2015 we therefore decided to structure as a in Consortium. Today composed of 9 UFA, plus the Dardilly High school, our consortium has become more professional. Our strategy and our European development plan is more and more ambitious, proof that we today place mobility at the center of our concerns and our development strategy.\r\nOur objectives of this project are in line with the autonomy of young people, developing skills, recognition of prior learning, territorial anchoring, the business relationship, and the notoriety of the Regional CFA.\r\n\r\n3 people are in charge of managing the project at the CFA.

The dynamics of group enables to create an effervescence that initiates projects and allows the exchange of practices.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to develop and consolidate individual mobility which is more and more popular with students, families, professionals and institutions. The discovery of new techniques, improving the language level, opening to European citizenship, gaining autonomy at work and in daily life are many assets recognized by all the stakeholders in mobility.\r\n\r\nOur mobilities are destined for learners of level V and IV (CAPA, BAC PRO, CS, BP by life-long training or apprenticeship) enrolled in 12 different educational streams. The Organization of internal training of the consortium explains our request of mobilities for mixed audiences (apprenticeship and school education).\r\n\r\nAfter 3 years of experience in Consortium, we are recognized, and the French masters of apprenticeship become more sensitive to this project. \r\nWe manage to cancel the brakes and objections from sending organizations, thus encouraging apprentices\u2019 mobilities.\r\nThe number of demand for mobilities increases each year which shows that the members of the consortium are more comfortable with the device and our project management. \r\nNumber of planned mobilities: \r\n\u2022 Learners: 102 (including 73 apprentices) \r\n\u2022 Group leaders: 28 \r\n\u2022 Staff: 26\r\n\r\nInternational experiences are in a dynamic integrated to the course of training, through certifications, validations of modules/RTC, by a Facultative International Mobility Unit... \r\nThis year we will experiment an ECVET project in order to go further in our objectives and our practices. \r\nThis pilot project, led by the Motte-Servolex center and accompanied by the Regional CFA, was intended to be a first experimentation, renewed, and copied by other members in future years.\r\nThe project Consortium III EFP will run over one year in order to accumulate experience with projects ERASMUS + and to apply for a 'Charter' soon. \r\nFor learners, institutions offer mobilities in foreign companies for 2 or 3 weeks. \r\nWe think nevertheless to extend these mobilities in order to make long mobility (mobility ERASMUSPRO). \r\nStaffs, meanwhile, will spend 2 to 7 days mobility in training centers and partner companies.\r\n\r\nAltogether 73 apprentices, 29 high school students, 28 leaders and 26 staff will benefit from a mobility in Italy, Germany, Spain, Norway, Denmark... \r\nBack home, they will present their experience and communicate through our different media and partners so that the project will have the expected impact on businesses, the territory, and our institutions. \r\nThe quality approach that we initiated 2 years ago gives us the means and tools to carry out the follow-up of the project and its evaluation in order to ensure its relevance and efficiency.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this project is part of a long-term approach where multiple benefits such as: professional enrichment of learners and staff, dynamism of teams and learners, cross-cultural exchanges, the valuation of different actors\u2026., already impact participating institutions and the way we teach.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FR01-KA102-047024_5"], ["4PS", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 5766.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047223_coordinator"], ["4PS", "Znanje za prihodnost", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", 159249.0, "Within the framework of Erasmus +, BIC Ljubljana is intensifying its cooperation with its long-standing partners, that are providing high-quality student placements and high-quality staff training. We regularly carry out all the planned mobilities, which we expand every year, as we want to find quality learning places for all the educational programs that we implement. We update the content of curricula based on experience from abroad. Cooperation with education organizations lead to several examples of good practices (eg transfer of chemical labeling practices) to the introduction of modern methods of teaching. With mobility, we raise the level of professional profile of staff and thus the quality of the education process. VET practical education abroad enables the integration of professional and soft competences - in practice and in daily organizational problems. We strive to maintain a constant connection with global trends in the profession and the labor market, and therefore we strongly encourage staff training and therefore we cooporate in Erasmus + program as well as with national programs (Raising Vocational Teacher Competencies).\r\nIn the past year, we met with ECVET expert and implemented improvements to follow ECVET principles more systematically. In recognizing student learning outcomes, we take into account and assess the acquired knowledge abroad. One of the novelties is the form, which gives us an assessment of the practical knowledge of every student at a foreign employer. All participants in mobility also receive Europass mobility.\r\nThe selection of students is carried out on the basis of published criteria and the counseling service can propose candidates according to special needs and social status.\r\nWe pay special attention to the preparation of students for mobility - we conduct a workshop on preparing CVs and take care of the transfer of international experiences among students. A part of the preparations is also a language course and a review of the geography / history of the host.\r\nTeachers are involved in the preparation of documents and the organization of the path, and receive practical information from colleagues who have already been on training in a given host country.\r\nIn the past year, we attended a workshop at CMEPIUS entitled \"Strengthening the employment potential of students\" and implemented new methods in the framework of student mobility evaluation. After mobility, we meet with students and we embed an international experience with an emphasis on the acquired soft competencies. In this way, students share informal experiences with us, and on the basis of the information obtained we improve the next mobility and prepare students better for them.\r\nWith teachers returning from mobility, we discuss the quality of work placements and staff training places in order to improve them in the future. After the completion of the project, teachers are provided with instructions for obtaining points. They also submit a report to their pedagogical supervisor, to fulfill their training announced in the yearly work plan.\r\nStudents give their experiences to classmates and the general public (blog), and teachers to staff and employers. The result of knowledge learned abroad is a book pastry Kruharije & Cukrnije with recipes and methods, which have been taught abroad for many years. Teachers of the Veterinary Techniques (VT) program are regularly involved in the training and introduce the most recent practical tasks (PEPAS system) in professional matura courses of the VT program.\r\nEvery 2-3 years at BIC Ljubljana we organize an international professional conference where we connect our participants of education and professional public from Slovenia and abroad. We often associate the conference with Erasmus + invited lecturers from abroad.\r\nWith E + mobility we aim to improve the employability of students. The former student participated in the first mobility at the time she attended the BIC LJ as a confectioner. Later, she enrolled to vocational college BIC LJ and again successfully applied for the Erasmus + placement. She found her practice at a high-quality employer in Belgium - Del Rey confectionery, ranked among the 100 best confectioners in the world. At the end of the practice, she was offered an immediate regular employment, which she intends to accept immediately after graduation.\r\nGeneraly the sscope of mobility is expanding.

It also incldes a preparatory visit by one CAFRE staff to visit College ten Doorn in the autumn 2018. The relationship between CAFRE and College ten Doorn has been established as CAFRE is hosting a two week traineeship for 15 College ten Doorn agriculture students in March 2018, following a staff visit in January 2018. \r\n\r\nThe remit of the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) is to develop the competencies and values of people entering and working in the agri-food industry and to provide them with the capability to contribute to the sustained economic growth of the industry and the development of the rural society.\r\nFor the agriculture sector this involves\r\n\u2022 Providing training for new entrants. CAFRE is the main provider for agriculture in Northern Ireland and is the only college in the island of Ireland offering courses from Level 2 to Master\u2019s Degree level.\r\n\u2022 Providing skills based and managerial training for existing businesses\r\n\u2022 Supporting farmers and growers through Business Development Groups, providing group based learning and provision of advice and technology transfer.\r\nCAFRE Programmes are strongly vocational and learners completing agriculture programmes either return home to farm, pursue successful careers in the agri- food industry or continue with their education.\r\nThis project targets students completing the first year of the Level 3 Diploma in Agriculture delivered either fulltime, part-time or work-based. At Level 3, students combine practical husbandry skills with the underpinning knowledge needed to work in industry.  This group has been selected as they have:\r\n\u2022 Developed the basic skills needed to be able to work in industry\r\n\u2022 Have already some experience of working in industry\r\n\u2022 Recognise the differences in approach to managing a business in Northern Ireland with that in another country such as Belgium.\r\n\u2022 An opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills developed whilst on mobility to their coursework in the final year of their programme and\r\n\u2022 Disseminate the outcomes of the mobility to the students who enrol in September 2019.\r\nIt is anticipated that 12 students will take place in the mobility in March / April 2019. They will complete 10 days working in industry across a range of businesses, visit specialist agri-food businesses and cultural centres. \r\nThe expected outcomes of the mobility are:\r\n\u2022 Development of enhanced employability and vocational skills of students through work placement\r\n\u2022 Improved self-confidence\r\n\u2022 Acquisition of a high level of practical skills\r\n\u2022 Gain a broader range of experiences through working in businesses in Europe which will encourage students to be more mobile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the mobility is to help develop rounded individuals so monitoring will cover both the placement and social / cultural aspects of the mobility.\r\nAs the experience of living and working in another country will be challenging for participants, CAFRE regards all mobility participants as coming within the definition of \u201cvulnerable adults\u201d and is putting a high level of support. There therefore will always be a member of CAFRE staff on duty or on call to deal with eventualities.\r\nCAFRE staff will accompany the students to their placements on the first day, assist with introductions and ensure participants know exactly what is require from them. They will also visit the students each day on placement to monitor progress. This is also an opportunity for CAFRE to meet their supervisors in industry and establish links which will be of use during the review process.\r\nAs staff will be staying in the same accommodation as the student, staff will meet informally with the participants daily to discuss activities, address any issues or concerns that may arise and plan for the following day.\r\nParticipants will be encourage to reflect on what they have done and achieved which will enhance the value of the learning.\r\nProgress will be measured against the individuals learning plan agreed prior to departure. All achievements will be mapped against the learning outcomes of their programme and will contribute to the achievement of their target qualification.\r\nStaff accompanying the group will be required to produce a detailed report fro CAFRE Management on their return and disseminate the outcome of their training to course teams as they plan for future mobilities. \r\nPlacements are most likely to be in rural areas not accessible by public transport. Therefore the CAFRE staff will also be responsible for transporting students to and from their placements.\r\nThe staff will also be responsible for managing the budget and for accompanying participants on cultural and planned activities / visits to a range of locations of vocational interest.", "http://www.cafre.ac.uk", "College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA116-047550_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2RU", "TEXTHELP LTD*", 172488.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_16900", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT41"}
