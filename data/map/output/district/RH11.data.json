Aircraft delays also result in environmental costs: aircraft holding or queuing with engines on, resulting in excess environmental emissions and air quality or noise impact, unnecessary ground movements and activation of auxiliary power units.\nAirport IQ will develop a mobile information sharing system connecting back-end A-CDM systems with mobile devices (smartphones, tablets and other wearable devices) carried by ground staff. The system will provide the right information at the right place and time to the right people, making it easier for planners to make optimal use of resources. This will help reduce primary and reactionary delays, improve the reliability of estimates, and allow airlines to make smarter decisions about turnaround buffers, that will be shorter than before.  Airport IQ will also offer a simple way to simulate turnaround activities, making it possible to run operational exercises using the same mobile tools, which will simplify and improve the quality of training, as well as providing the basis for designing longer-term improvements in ground handling processes. \nThe solution has the potential to create significant economic and environmental savings for the entire air transport value chain, as demonstrated by pilot trials  to be organized in 3 European airports (Lisboa, Heathrow and Targu Mures), involving real end-users (i.e. ground handling and other airport staff) using \u201clive\u201d onsite data.

In agreement with our partner school Sekundarschule F\u00fcrstenberg from Germany, which also tries to raise the quality level of Healthy Schools Project activities, we will focus on the following themes: FOOD, EXERCISE and MENTAL HEALTH.\r\n\r\nBeside a healthy lifestyle we will seek other methods of teaching ICT, LANGUAGES, INTERCULTURAL LEARNING, the ways of introducing topics into curricula of individual subjects and new, innovative ways of teaching these contents to our students. Our partner school Langley Green Primary School from Great Britain was chosen as a school with rich experience in teaching ICT. Being a school with many immigrants the nature of work is different from other schools and it coincides with UNESCO goals.\r\n\r\nThe most important topics of this project are:\r\n\u2022 food, exercise and mental health,\r\n\u2022 ICT,\r\n\u2022 motivation, communication practices, language through culture, various teaching tools.\r\n\r\nEuropean connections, partnership, projects, training and the related new acquired knowledge and international experience in authentic environment are some guidelines at our school. Our school is located in the bilingual area where Italian is a second language and it represents part of our cultural heritage. The knowledge of a second language is important for the future of our students and better adaptation to the requirements of the European Union, developing multilingualism means acquiring different skills.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the acquired knowledge we want to influence our students as future active citizens who will be acquainted with our common history of European Union, will be able to communicate in intercultural dialogue, will be computer literate, will value health and exercise, will be acquainted with global and environmental problems, will be able to accept difference and who will think and act locally and globally. The project on mobility will help to know foreign education systems. We are going to try new methods of intercultural learning, ways of entering its contents into the curricula of individual subjects and seeking innovative ways of teaching. The acquired knowledge and experience will thus go beyond the boundaries of our school. The openness of our school to the local and wider environment is essential and one of our goals. Raising the level of teaching will be the foundation of our rich creativity and vision for the future.", "http://www.langleygreenprimary.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SI01-KA101-046814_1"], ["7PF", "A school for each and everyone", "Langley Green Primary School", 23035.0, "The aim of this project is to encourage and inspire pupils and teaching staff through engaging the direct teaching and promotion of Active Citizenship. By participating in engaging, motivating and achievable tasks and activities each participant has an opportunity to develop intrinsic motivation, sound emotional and social skills. This project is a way to further develop these skills with our students, preparing them for the future career market but it also offers valuable opportunities to expand our pedagogical practice  and our own professional competences. \r\nOver the two years, training and job shadowing will be targeted so  members of staff who will have most impact from their training and members of staff who would most benefit from the training will be selected. Groups of participating staff will be carefully selected so that there is a balance of experience and language skills. The selection process will be clear and transparent so that all members of staff are clear why and how successful staff are selected.\r\nSharing strategies and resources with other teachers in Europe will greatly benefit teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 skills and cultural background.\r\nWe wish to get our teachers to work cooperatively with other European schools and build a network through this Erasmus Plus project and Etwinning, which will lead us to further collaboration with foreign colleagues and school systems in the future.\r\nThis project will allow us to share and improve our school initiatives towards Active Citizenship through the exchange of good practices and teaching resources.\r\nPupils will have an active role i. e. mail correspondence, skype video communication, ICT based activities.\r\nWith this Erasmus Plus project we aim to train teachers who will participate in teaching courses and job shadowing in  Germany, Poland and Sweden. \r\nTeachers will be selected according to identified criteria and we already have a group of teachers interested in participating in this project. \r\nAssessment and dissemination are two of our main concerns whilst carrying out the project. All of the people involved, meaning parents, teachers and pupils will evaluate and disseminate what has been done through different media. We will also carry out a clear audit of current skills/expertise across staff and pupils before the project begins and complete the same audit at the end of the project so we have a clear measure for impact.\r\nThe impact will also be visible on the work published on the etwinning space and the 'Active Citizenship' guides produced for staff training. We will review our curriculum during the project to ensure skills acquired whilst we are collaborating with our partners are embedded as part of our ongoing curriculum. This will ensure that these skills continue to be taught and developed long after the project has finished. We should also see an improvement in the childrens' confidence when sharing their opinions and a child centred approach to teaching Active Citizenship  where pupil voice is strong. We will also see an improvement in the children's ability to make informed decisions and to think critically about issues and situations.\r\nWhen the project comes to and end we intend to make use of the contacts and collaboration skills learned through this valuable and interesting experience to develop future differentiated teaching and active citizenship plans.", "http://www.langleygreenprimary.co.uk", "Langley Green Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047330_coordinator"], ["7PF", "Claves hacia la excelencia; TIC y nuevas metodolog\u00edas", "Langley Green Primary School", 9288.0, "Pre-school and primary school (3-12 years old) located in a village that has around 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n There are 394 students distributed between two group-classes at each. Our students\u2019 families are from low socio cultural status backgrounds. There are 32 teachers working in the school.\r\n \r\nThe idea of this project arises while doing the Erasmus KA2 project, which ends in August 2018. During this project we have introduced new methodologies (CLIL, Peer-learning, Flipped classrooms). From this experience and its positive impact, due to its good results and the teachers\u2019 commitment, arises the necessity to go further and implement this new measures in the school.\r\n \r\nOur main objectives during the following 4 years:  Internationalize our school, enhance our students and teachers\u2019 ICT skills, and develop our students\u2019 entrepreneurial spirit by working through European collaborative projects, develop students\u2019 personal autonomy and broaden their horizons and allow them to improve their motivation towards learning. Enhancement of our teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 Web 2.0. tools competence, usage of innovative methodologies such as CLIL, Gamified lessons, Escape Classrooms, Webquests, Peer-learning, Flipper classrooms, robotics in Science\u2026 In order to achieve this aim we need to train our teachers\u2019 staff in these fields. Having a good command of ICT and new methodologies it is mandatory so as to engage our students.\r\n \r\nDuring the first and second term of our first year\u2019s project, we are going to realize five Job Shadowings. The teachers involved in this project are some of the permanent employee and one from the Senior Management Team (management and organisation).\r\nBoth training courses will be realized during July of the second year and they will last 6-12 days.\r\nSeven teachers will be trained, each one of them in a different field of methodology or in the usage of ICT tools and later they will teach the rest of the teachers\u2019 staff of our school.\r\n \r\nActivities to be done:\r\nThe year before the beginning of the project: free English language courses at the same school for the teachers who are going to do the training and also for those who are eager to improve their English skills.\r\nA promoting team will be created as well.\r\nOnce we have found the schools where we are going to attend a job shadowing, we will plan the stay in order to take the most out of it.\r\nA work plan is going to be done so as to prepare the stay, to evaluate the results, to introduce any necessary changes or recommendations that our partners might suggest us.\r\nBefore we do the training course (that will last 6-12 days) we are going to work on each methodology in order to widen our vision and knowledge about the field and at the same time knowing in advance what doubts do we have.\r\n\r\nThe following step is the courses and the job shadowing.\r\n\r\nOnce we will have finished, we are going to held observations between teachers so everyone will have the opportunity to learn from the participant teachers in the project.\r\nThe Senior Management Team will ask lesson plans monthly where there will be reflected the new methodologies. Video tutorials will be recorded at school in order to show and train new teachers in our school and at the same time, to spread our project.\r\nHopefully our teachers will learn enough how to implement ICT tools and new methodologies so as to help the rest of our teachers\u2019 staff apply this knowledge in their lessons. We will continue with our schools\u2019 internationalisation thanks to our new partners and eTwinning projects. Better academic results, higher students\u2019 confidence and autonomy, openness towards other cultures and coexistence.\r\nBetween mid-term and long-term period, one of the impacts of this project will be the improvement of core subjects and English academic results in Key Competences tests.\r\nOur school will benefit from this project as well regarding our academic results and teachers motivation.

Our experiment sharing is not going to stay between our partnership because intellectual outputs will be created and broadcast.\r\nThis project gather together seven partners from Spain (main coordinator), France, Poland, Italy, Germany, Cyprus and United Kingdom. Four of them have been working previously together on a common project.\r\n\r\nWe have designed the three years project around teachers training, transnational mobilities and learning workshop and teacher\u2019s seminars.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the project (2015/2016), there will be one course per term. Each school will send at least two teachers who will have to develop a seminar in their own school about what they learnt. The courses are held in UK, Cyprus and France, and are related to problem based learning, entrepreneurship and developing creative thinking. \r\n\r\nDuring the second (2016/2017) and third (2017/2018) years of the project we will develop six tasks in total, working on skills closely linked to employability (creativity, problem solving, creative thinking, communication, well being, respect, team, workorganisation, health). There will be seven transnational meetings in which pupils travelling from all the schools will work on common activities in collaboration with pupils from foreign schools, showing what they have learned with the developed task. Moreover, apart from using these meetings to evaluate and organize the next steps of the project, the hosting teachers will develop a seminar about how to we work a specific key competence.\r\n\r\nThrough the tasks, pupils will create a pupet using different elements of the traditional dresses of the other countries,;build typical buildings using LEGO, organizing their work to plan how to do it; write a story in collaboration with the other countries and read it to other students; cook a traditional dish of every country and create an exposiction expressing their emotions after listening to traditional songs of all the countries, among others.\r\n\r\nAssessment and dissemination are two or our main concerns while doing the project.

First, the concrete and immediate ones, throughout the two final products we\u2019re going to create (a website with all the resources and a book compelling all the key competences seminars) and, for students and teachers, the use of English in a meaningful way. Then, the invisibles and long terms ones, throughout the improvement of our students\u2019 employability, being made sensitive to creativity, problem solving and critical thinking, emotional intelligence, organization skills, respect of the differences and communication.
