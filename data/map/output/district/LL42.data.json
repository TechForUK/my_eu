The participants come from all three of these types of schools. \r\n\r\nGaining international experience is invaluable for young people and facilitates their later entry into the professional world.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to improve the independence, flexibility and the language skills of young people, to promote multilingualism, to add practical training and intercultural learning and to lead young people towards an open minded and European way of thinking. Through this training in a European context our students should be enabled to access  the national or the European labour market after their training. This is a major contribution to fight youth unemployment in Europe.\r\n\r\nBy implementing  ECVET tools  in the project  the creditability of the stay abroad should be facilitated.\r\n\r\nOur project partners are both larger and smaller establishments in the hospitality and catering industry  in the above mentioned countries. Our partner companies provide mentors for the students to  introduce them to their new job environment. This ensures a favourable  learning outcome during their stay abroad. It also leads to an international / europan image of our school.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will be presented on  our open day, during  our information evenings on hospitality training  at the Carinthian Tourism School as well as  at regional information sessions on Erasmus + in our federal state (Carinthia) .
