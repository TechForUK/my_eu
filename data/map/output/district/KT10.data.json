This will be carried out through the development of the Long Range Ultrasonic technology which has a certain number of advantages: sufficient inspection time, cost compared to the conventional ultrasonic testing, 100% inspection coverage (rail\u2019s head, web and the foot). This project will develop a guided wave LRUT system not only for rail inspection but also for real time monitoring of the rail and to create an intelligent railway infrastructure. Flexible sensors will be embedded in the railways and a collection data system will be developed and integrated on the existent systems. This will also extend the life of the materials through early repair of rail tracks. The rail track is a natural wave guide where waves could easily propagate for long distance and detect defects in different area such as the web the head and the foot. Moreover long lengths of rail track could be detected at once making this a cost efficient technique for continuous monitoring. The system will offers 100% coverage up to 50m from one single location. Multiple sensors will be used to cover long distance inspection. Significant technical issues need to be addressed and solved before this technology can be considered a viable and industrial solution. The prototype demonstrations to date have shown promising results but have been limited to static testing. Any loss of signal or momentary surface interference results in a signal that is similar to that of a defect, thus the potential of false positive indications is high, which could severely impact the efficiency of overall inspection. Furthermore the potential of permanently mounted sensors will be investigated for critical areas of the rail network.", 202934.0, 1261037.0, "MONITORAIL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_97868_983486105"], ["9AD", "High Performance Modular Architecture of Acquisition and Control command system dedicated to test Electrical systems for Aeronautics", "National Instruments", "'The HighPMAAC project will create, design, develop and validate a new High Performance Modular architecture of Acquisition and Control Command system dedicated to test Electrical Systems for Aeronautics in an efficient way.\nThis new architecture will allow easily to perform tests in an \u201cindependent way\u201d at the Equipment Level.

During operation, the graphite and other carbonaceous materials like carbon brick, pyrocarbon and silicon carbide coatings are contaminated by fission products and neutron activation. These irradiated carbonaceous wastes are problematic due to their content of long-lived radioisotopes (e.g. Carbon14, Chlorine 36) and due to their large volumes. About 250000 t of i-carbon are existing, worldwide. Acceptable solutions have not yet been established to handle this kind of waste. This fact also represents a significant drawback for the market introduction of graphite-moderated reactors like Very/High-Temperature Reactors (V/HTR) as a promising Generation IV system candidate.  Graphite moderated reactors represent the very first generation of nuclear reactors and therefore need to be decommissioned ahead of other reactor types which evolved later. Presently, accelerated decommissioning of GCR and RBMK and subsequent disposal of i-graphite is the preferred option for not leaving this waste as a legacy for future generations. The CARBOWASTE project aims at an integrated waste management approach for this kind of radioactive wastes which are mainly characterized as Intermediate Level Waste (ILW), due to the varying content of long-lived radioisotopes. Methodologies and databases will be developed for assessing different technology options like direct disposal in adopted waste containers, treatment & purification before disposal or even recycling i-carbonaceous material for reuse in the nuclear field. The feasibility of the associated processes will be experimentally investigated to deliver data for modeling the microstructure and localization of contaminants.

Of the 250 000 tonnes of the material worldwide, the bulk of it is in the EU.\n\nCurrently, the small amount of i-graphite waste that has been retrieved from test reactors has been mostly stored in silos and vaults, awaiting a decision on its disposal. Even though i-graphite is classified as long-lived low- or intermediate-level waste, more robust and sustainable waste management options need to be devised to avert the radiation risks it poses.\n\nFinanced by the EU's Euratom programme, the project 'Treatment and disposal of irradiated graphite and other carbonaceous waste' (CARBOWASTE) developed integrated guidelines for the retrieval, treatment and disposal of i-graphite. It targeted both legacy waste and waste to be produced by future generations of reactors.\n\nAmong CARBOWASTE's achievements was the development of techniques for separating the coated particles from the moderator graphite of high-temperature reactor fuel. CARBOWASTE discovered that thermal, chemical or microbiological treatment can get rid of a significant proportion of the contamination. The project also investigated the possible reuse of this purified material. A sufficient understanding of irradiated graphite has been generated to conclude with confidence that irradiated graphite waste can be safely disposed in a wide range of disposal systems.\n\nAs decommissioning looms ever closer, the CARBOWASTE toolbox promises to prove invaluable in the safe and effective disposal of i-graphite waste.", null, "http://www.bradtec.com", "/docs/results/images/2013-08/55651.jpg", "fp7_88385_999686560"], ["0HR", "Innovative Welding Processes for New Rail Infrastructures", "Jackweld Limited", "WRIST will develop and demonstrate flexible and cost effective joining processes for rail products, and in particular for advanced bainitic rail steels, which have been developed to answer the increasing demands of increasing speed and growth of railway\u2019s load.
