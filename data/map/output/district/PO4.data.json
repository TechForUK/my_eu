The hotel industry, business, an excellent choice of hotels with high annual occupation, the traffic crossings in clear peak and the oil refineries, now with entrance and exit by the external gate, conclude an economic activity with enormous potential and which demands highly-qualified jobs.\r\n\r\n> Consequently, this project seeks to respond to the demand for highly-qualified professionals in these professional sectors and in other emerging sectors. As such, it is aimed at students with an average age of 18 years, recently qualified in Professional Technical Training, which lack a transnational dimension in their work experience and they need a highly qualified professional ability, a level B2 in a foreign language for special purposes in their profession and a mentality and entrepreneurial culture in order to find and produce their own work.\r\n\r\n> Consequently they offer 50 mobility placements, to carry out long-duration practical work experience from October 2014 to June 2015, in businesses from five European countries: United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Austria and Italy. \r\n\r\n> Those recently qualified in Technical work will receive, before their departure, 80 hours linguistic and cultural training in the language of the destination country.

The preparation will be completed abroad, where, during the first week, the participants will be given a language and cultural training, together with introductory lectures to the internship, which will consist in 4 weeks full-time work placements in different companies according to their professional profile.The project  is set in a geographical context which is called the Bassa Padovana area, in the South part of the Venetian region, which is characterized by an economy that is continuously suffering from the shortage of job occupation due to the financial and economic crisis. What is more, really radical historical and cultural conditionings and the permanence of genre and ethnic stereotypes make difficult to change behaviours and organization models of small enterprises and limit the necessary innovation processes.In this context, the project  offered the young people important formative opportunities by means of the mobility activities that helped  them to improve the relationships with the other, either at genre or culture of origin levels, to perceive  the difference as a resource , not only as a limit.

Despite this, tourism is not so diffuse and the main kind of tourism activity is related to the sea and the beaches, while the number of farm stays is the lowest of Tuscany.
