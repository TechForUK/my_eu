Trani\", \"F. Orioli\" and by Essenia UETP. The project foresees the allocation of 50 grants for the realization of traineeships in European companies operating in the Fashion industry and located in the United Kingdom, Spain and Lithuania. Beneficiaries of the mobility action will be 20 recent graduates and 30 students in the third and fourth year of studies in the sector \"Clothes and Fashion/Textile production\", coming from the Institutes members of the Consortium. Recent graduates will carry out the mobility within 12 months from their graduation and their traineeship will last 120 days (plus 2 days of travel), duration considered necessary to attain a complete training and professional experience. The traineeship performed by students will last 21 days (plus 2 days of travel) the presence of 4 accompanying persons  is foreseen. The promoters desire to realize this project to address the training and employment needs of the territories in which they are set, where the Fashion industry represents a relevant driver for the local economy and has got a huge potential of development. The fashion sector is composed by highly innovative companies with a great economical potential and it is one of the most dynamic in Europe, contributing for the 7%  gross national product of EU. It has high development rate and offers employment to almost 5 millions of people in Europe (Study on the economy of culture in Europe, 2006, \u201cCreative Economy \u2013 the Challenge of Assessing the Creative Economy \u2013towards informed policy-making\u201d, 2008).Anyway, the fashion sector requires highly qualified operators, with adequate practical and operational competences, transversal competences, including linguistic ones. So it is essential to provide young people  entering the labour market with practical skills and soft skills, to tackle unemployment, to allow companies to have adequate labor force, and, finally, to strengthen the productive capacity of territories. So, the objective of the project is to better qualify local human resources through the carrying out of international mobilities, focusing on the acquisition of technical and transversal skills required by the fashion industry, in order to make the professional profile of the participants more competitive on the labour market, contributing to increase their employability and to takle the phenomenon of massive migration of young people from the areas of origin. Carrying out a traineeship in European companies operating in the fashion industry will enable participants to integrate theoretical studies with practical activities, according to the philosophy of \"learning by doing\". During the traineeship they will be constantly monitored and supported by tutors who will assess their progress, and- at the end of the experience- the learning outcomes achieved, releasing the appropriate certifications.The experience will contribute to achieving the following results in the participants:- Improvement of practical and operative skills in the fashion sector and consolidation of technical and professional knowledge- Improvement of language competences, including the sectorial language of the fashion industry- Knowledge of different labor markets and other economies, new methodologies and practices in the fashion sector- Familiarization with social and cultural contexts of other EU countries, and strenghtening of European citizenship- Development of transversal communication, organizational and problem solving competences- Acquisition of  national and European certification expendable in the labor market- Upgrading and integration of the CV with new competences and experiences- Opportunities for recognition of competences acquired abroad (ECVET)- Improvement of the capacity of identification and evaluation of employment opportunities in the labor marketThe project will have a positive impact on the members of the Consortium, in terms of: capacity building of the organization and management of international activities with local and foreign partners; strengthening of strategies for internationalization and development, introduction of transnational mobility activities as \"systemic\"; updating of curricula to the needs of the area and the world of work. Finally, the project will bring benefits also to the local production sector, who can rely on a more skilled and qualified workforce.", "http://www.ecoluxelondon.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA102-005239_5"], ["4LR", "Tell Me More!

The nature of the Structured Training course which we are applying for dictates that the European Dimension be a key element of the project and will be part of pupils learning experience.\r\n\r\nWe beleive that our school is very well placed at this point in time to look outwards to learn from our colleagues in France about a broad and balanced curriculum.

VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\" foresees the realization of:\r\n- 70 mobilities lasting 122 days (of which 120 of traineeship and 2 of travel) addressed to recent graduates that will perform a traineeship in companies located in the following countries: United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland.\r\n- 20 mobilities lasting 14 days (of which 12 of training and 2 of travel) and addressed to the staff of VET Institutes and organizations. \r\nThey will carry out the training experience in companies set in Spain.\r\nThe professional sectors in which the traineeships and the training/job shadowing activities will be performed are: \r\n- Tourism and Catering\r\n- Fashion Industry and textile production\r\n- ITC, Communication and new media \r\n- Marketing, Commercial Services Sales, Administration and accountancy\r\n- Electronics and electrotechnics; mechanical engineering/mechatronics\r\n- Socio-sanitary field \r\n- Engineering, environment and territory\r\nTherefore, beneficiaries of the mobilities will be, respectively,  recent graduates that have obtained the title of study in one of the aforementioned sectors, and staff from Institutes, entities and VET organization operating in those fields. \r\nThe projects was born to meet  the training need- in terms of practical experience- of recent graduates, and to favour the entry (and the permanence, in the case of the staff) in a globalized labor market that requires the mastery and the updating of knowledge, competences and abilities both sectorial and personal and transversal (intercultural, linguistic, in IT, entrepreneurial). \r\nThe needs of the VET world and the necessities of the job market have been noticed by Essenia UETP srl starting from the debates occurred during the informative and training meeting that the company periodically realizes at National level, face-to-face and virtually.  The analysis realized starting from these activities of discussion and sensitization highlighted the need of implementing transnational mobility activities for the strengthening and updating of professional competences, both of recent graduates and staff, in the sectors identified in the project. In fact, they are sectors extremely relevant for the national economy (tourism, fashion, commerce), constantly increasing (ICT, electronics/electrotechnics, mechanical engineering/mechatronics, marketing), and in which the request of specific competences has grown (social field, mechanical engineering/mechatronics,  environment and territory). \r\nBesides the technical-professional competences related to the identified sectors, the project contributes to enhance the European identity and to improve intercultural, linguistic and digital skills, allowing the development of a set of personal and transversal abilities, essential in the current occupational scenario. \r\nThe realization of the project \"E.A.S.Y. VET - Experiences Abroad for Staff and Young graduates in VET\"  is part of the internationalization strategy of Essenia UETP, that foresees the implementation and the development of activities aimed at improving the quality and increasing the quantity of transnational mobility projects. \r\nBesides the transversal phases of management, monitoring and dissemination, the project foresees the implementation of the following activities, carried out according to procedures and methodologies already experimented over the years, and that guarantee high quality standards:\r\n-Information and sensitization\r\n-Selection of participants\r\n-Linguistic and pedagogical preparation\r\n-Logistic organization of mobilities\r\n-Evaluation of the project\r\n-Dissemination of project results\r\n-Follow-up\r\nThe quality procedures adopted are constantly improved and updated, also thanks to the use of new technologies and to the professional retraining of Essenia UETP\u2019s human resources, that occurs through training activities realized in the framework of Erasmus+ KA2 projects. Over the years, Essenia UETP  has further broadened its already wide network of European partners, identifying entities and companies able to offer transnational mobility experiences meeting high quality standards and preferring , among them, the ones of proved experience.  All over the National territory relationships with VET Institutes, public and private entities, companies have been consolidated  to assure congruence and coherence between the activities proposed and the needs of the users. At local level, Essenia UETP pursues  the objective of enhancing the cooperation with the bodies in charge of implementing the approaches and of adopting European methodologies and tools for the certification and validation of the competences (ECVET), in order to make the  formal and informal competences acquired by the participants during the mobility experiences more spendable on the labour market.", "http://www.ecoluxelondon.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005687_20"]]}}, "outwardCode": "N14"}
