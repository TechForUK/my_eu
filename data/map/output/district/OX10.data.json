Growing scientific evidence suggests that more frequent and severe weather extremes such as heat waves, hurricanes, flooding and droughts are having an ever increasing impact, with the range and effects on society exacerbated when CI is disrupted / destroyed. EWE causing (cascaded) CI outages frequently cause major social and economic loss in disasters. The provisions and procedures to reduce their impact and consequences have often proved inadequate. The probability of exposure to EWE is expected to increase, both in frequency and intensity. Obviously, there is a need to build anticipatory adaptation and organizational resilience to these relatively unforeseen and unexpected EWE impacts on CI.\n\nHence, allowing for future EWE in the design and operational parameters of new and current CI is of fundamental and pressing strategic importance, to ensure cost effective fit, for purpose CI over the lifetime of the assets. There is an obligation to revisit the risk posed to new and existing CI and to develop practical (evidence based) responses by risk-based techniques and a set of validated tools and data sets tailored to practical needs reflecting the level of the risk and the severity of impact (social, economic, environmental, etc.) that would result in CI failure due to EWE.\n\nINTACT recognizes that a European-wide coordinated and cooperative effort is required.

As it is impossible to foresee the next invasive or emerging pest or pathogen, the overall approach will be generic. However, the new tools will be tested on four main types of pests and pathogens, i.e. foliar moths and needle blights causing tree growth loss, wood boring beetles and dieback fungi causing tree mortality. Prominent experts from the main forested countries of EU and the main regions of origin of invasive pests, e.g. North America, Australasia, China and South Africa, will contribute to the project, and ensure continuity and complementarity with past and current Euphresco and EU projects. By developing cost-effective, environmentally friendly tools for the prevention, detection and control, the project will reduce the tremendous economic losses caused by invasive forest pests and pathogens and help to maintain the critical ecosystem services provided by EU forests, including climate change mitigation.", 262763.0, 5008637.0, "HOMED", null, null, null, null, "http://www.cabi.org", null, "h2020_215943_999650961"], ["8BA", "Psychiatric Ratings using Intermediate Stratified Markers: providing quantitative biological measures to facilitate the discovery and development of new treatments for social and cognitive deficits in AD, SZ, and MD", "P1vital Limited", "The current nosology of neuropsychiatric disorders allows for a pragmatic approach to treatment choice, regulation and clinical research. However, without a biological rationale for these disorders, drug development has dramatically stagnated in the past decades. In a coordinated effort encompassing academic experts, SMEs, patient and family organizations, regulators, ECNP and EFPIA partners, this project aims to develop a quantitative biological approach to the understanding and classification of neuropsychiatric diseases to accelerate the discovery and development of better treatments for patients. This project will concentrate on Schizophrenia (SZ), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and Major Depression (MD), as these disorders share part of their symptomatology, in particular social withdrawal and certain cognitive deficits, such as deficits in attention, working memory and sensory processing. By applying innovative technologies (e.g. EEG, cognitive tasks, (f)MRI, smartphone monitoring, and (epi-)genetics) to deep phenotype a clinical cohort of SZ and AD patients combined with a wider analysis of existing clinical data sets from major European and global disease cohorts that also include MD, we will define a set of quantifiable biological parameters best able to cluster and differentiate SZ, AD, and MD patients that do, or do not, exhibit social withdrawal. First, by mining large European SZ, AD and MD cohort datasets with already available social and cognitive proxy measures, and, second, by obtaining objective measures of social exploration levels (using a novel smartphone application), phenotypic relationships with social and cognitive measures will be further tested. For instance we might predict that socially withdrawn individuals may have lower cognitive functioning and poorer clinical course compared to those who are more socially engaged. The two approaches will then come together via selected individuals with low or high social withdrawal who have also been assessed in the deep phenotyping study using integrated behavioural, cognitive, attentional, sensory processing, EEG, and MRI data.\nIn phase I of the project (years 1-3), the clinical deep phenotyping study will provide a proof-of-concept analysis for this quantitative biological approach and will concentrate on SZ and AD patients. To identify shared genetic factors potentially related to the social withdrawal symptom and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders, a cross-disorder genome-wide genetic analysis will be performed in the largest world-wide available samples of SZ, AD, and MD patients. Genetic associations from the global cohorts will be evaluated for their relevance for social withdrawal and cognitive deficits in subsamples with relevant (proxy) phenotypes in large and available European cohorts that have genetic data and clinical proxy data on social withdrawal, sensory processing, attention and working memory available. Data integration of genetic and epigenetic studies through an innovative molecular landscaping approach will lead to the identification of new biological substrates and candidate genes underlying these phenotypic domains. These will provide the basis for reverse translation and construct validation studies in rodents which will be tested in behavioural, cognitive, EEG and O2 amperometry paradigms that are homologous to those performed in the clinical deep phenotyping study. Where appropriate, the clinical studies will inform on the use of appropriate perturbations, including genetic modification to the systems and substrates being probed. Additional preclinical studies will extend the characterisation of the substrates underlying the integrated socio-cognitive traits beyond simple reverse translation by exploiting higher spatial or temporal resolution techniques such as 2-photon imaging, single unit electrophysiology, in vivo micro-dialysis and biosensors.\nTogether, these studies will provide new classification and assessment tools", 1057794.0, 14746467.0, "PRISM", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_209457_968962489"], ["8DE", "Secretariat for the International Research Consortium on Animal Health", "Cab International", "Animal diseases can cause serious social, economic and environmental damage, impact on animal welfare and in some cases directly threaten human health.

On completion of the PReDicT project, the P1vital PReDicT Test will be ready for market launch. Depression is a common, serious and in some cases life\u2010threatening condition, affecting around 350 million people in the world and 11% of EU citizens suffer from depression at some point in their life. It takes 4-6 weeks after starting antidepressant treatment before a physician can detect whether the treatment is working, the majority of patients with depression do not respond to the first treatment they are prescribed and it can take several months before an effective treatment is identified. During this time a patients\u2019 ability to work and function socially is severely impaired, and they can spend many weeks or months absent from work placing a substantial burden on the economy and healthcare resources. The P1vital PReDicT Test addresses this problem by identifying within 1 week of starting treatment whether an antidepressant is working or not which can significantly reduce the time required to identify an effective treatment.  Patients benefit from this by returning to good mental health sooner. The aggregated economic cost of depression in the EU is \u20ac92 billion, amounting to 1% of the total European gross domestic product.  It is estimated that the P1vital PReDicT Test has the potential to reduce these healthcare and economic costs by more than 10%.

Within the whole company international cooperation through transnational projects is of growing importance. In this way, not only the knowledge, but also the experience of intercultural understanding as well as the difference of values, standards and customs of other countries are very important for successful international collaborations. We therefore consider the continual immersion of internationality in our company as essential. The basis for a holistic implementation of the necessary competencies is already built through the apprenticeship.\r\nWith numerous workshops the apprentices at fischer learn the basic tools for their professional career as well as the necessary skills and competencies for their daily work. In order to provide them with the best chance within the meaning of a future oriented apprenticeship to apply and deepen their knowledge in a foreign context, we aim to be part of the project \"commercial training goes international\" and send apprentices as part of a cooperation promoting project off for four weeks. This creates a unique project experience for nine full age apprentices having diverse commercial profiles within three delegations. In this context, we attach great importance to deepen the apprentices' language skills, to sensibilise their awareness of different cultures, values and standards as well as to strengthen their intercultural competencies. In order to ensure learning success, the apprentices join an international project in one of our subsidiaries. The learning objectives overall include grasping upon the assignment of task, identifying possible obstacles that might affect the project's goals, handling unforeseen complications effectively, developing solutions and experiencing project management. In sum, the apprentices are offered a unique opportunity to apply their knowledge in an unknown working environment abroad while relying on their previous work with fischer.\r\nThe four-week exchange programme is divided into two parts: To begin with, the apprentices participate in a one-week language course focusing on specific terminology related to their job. The main part of their stay abroad is their three-week internship in the fischer subsidiary Wallingford, England. Because of the size of the subsidiary, their former participation in company-wide collaborations, and English as lingua franca, we consider an international deployment to England as the highest possible benefit for all involved parties. During their stay abroad, all apprentices are accommodated by host families in order to deepen their English language skills also apart from work.\r\nInterning for our subsidiary, the apprentices work within specific projects that suits their apprentice concentration best. For their project work, a project supervisor of the subsidiary takes care of them. At the same time, the apprentices get an experienced contact person Germany aside with whom they discuss and prepare the project in advance and who is also available in any case during their stay abroad. In this way, the apprentices can rely on different contact person during their delegation and the whole project is anchored throughout the company. The subsidiary in England and the vocational training department in Germany cooperate to organise the foreign assignment.\r\nAt the beginning of the project, the project supervisor and the apprentice together define the project's goals as well as milestones, which are also fixed within his or her learning objectives. Working along the milestones, the apprentice is an adequate member of the project team with his or her field of responsibility. Being a family business it is very important for us that the project is run accordingly to our philosophy and that the fischer values are also imparted abroad.\r\nApart from the professional experience, our aim is also to increase the cultural awareness of our apprentices. Therefore, we intend to organise multifaceted study trips to culturally educated them and increase their intercultural competencies.\r\nBefore the end of their stay abroad the apprentices present their project results in the subsidiary to demonstrate the benefit to the local employees. For the same reason the results are also presented in Germany and the apprentices further report on their singular form of training.\r\n\"europass MOBILITY\" as well as further in-house certificates for their stay abroad are meant to attest an education far in excess of an average one.
