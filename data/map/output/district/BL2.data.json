However, there are two factors that will increasingly affect future protective coatings developments: VOC emissions and health/safety issues. Firstly there is a strong mandate to apply VOC emissions legislation to protective coatings (and in particular extend the Paint Products Directive  to include them). Secondly REACH, together with increasing effects of chemicals on humans supported through medical literature, may prevent the use of some coating materials.\nOur vision for BARRIER-PLUS is to develop one component waterborne barrier coatings that are competitive in performance to two component coatings. One component waterborne coatings have a number of advantages over two component coatings and solventborne systems: low VOC emissions; low fire risk; lower insurance issues; no exposure to isocyanates, epoxy resins or amines; no waste or poor film performance arising from pot life problems. Our approach is to build upon recent research in the organic/inorganic nanocomposites field to create enhanced film barrier properties.\nAlthough this project is focused on the protection of steel, the technology developed will have application in the protection of other substrates, eg concrete, brickwork and stonework.", 67010.0, 2013634.0, "BARRIER PLUS", null, null, null, null, "http://www.leighspaints.com", null, "fp7_111430_953444235"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["6NW", "French language and cultural links", "SS Osmund and Andrew's R.C.

This mobility project consists of members of teaching staff attending an intense training course in France.  French is the language taught throughout our school and so the aim of this is to develop and encourage new skills, knowledge and understanding of language learning within a real context. This will help us at the same time to develop a deeper sense of citizenship within the European Union,  create links with France and prepare us for the new statutory primary languages curriculum for September 2014.    We want to send four members of staff to improve language competence, develop language teaching skills, collect resources and to build relationships with France.  We will make a link with a partner school so that more people can be actively involved in the link with France  through technologies such as the website, blog and Skype.  The participants will then share learning and cultural experiences with the rest of the school staff and community in order to involve more members of staff, pupils and parents in moving our school forward in language capability with a European dimension.  The impact of the training back in our school will be closely monitored and assessed by Senior Leaders and MFL subject Coordinator to ensure that the objectives set have been achieved and that progress is being made.  We aim to raise the profile of language learning and encourage positive attitudes amongst all staff.

Not to use just immediately after the course but to ensure the children get a well rounded, engaging experience of Spain and its language throughout their time here at Castle Hill. After all, the more the children can relate to a subject, the better immersed they become in that subject, the better their learning journey will be.The only way to sustain the children\u2019s engagement in the language is if they have access to these invaluable authentic experiences. The fact that some of these children know you\u2019ve been to the actual country they are learning the language of is amazing, because they can instantly access facts, ask questions and have them confidently answered, again anchoring their learning to something tangible.There are many positive reasons to be given the opportunity to go to Spain, but the fundamental reason for why we would be willing to undertake this CPD is the invaluable effect and long term impact it will have on the children\u2019s learning of the language. In a time when fewer students are choosing to study languages at GCSE, A Level and degree level, it is imperative to capture their eagerness for learning, now. The benefits for learning any language, not least the second most spoken language in the world, are endless.As part of our recent OFSTED inspection the school had to complete an HMCI Commentary regarding foreign language provision in the school. During feedback they suggested ways we could further develop our language provision by; - introducing it into Key Stage 1 and EYFS, - building a bank of resources aimed at their level to build their knowledge and confidence within this. - making links with partner secondary schools that our children will attend, to further develop our own language provision and - creating links with other primary schools. Doing this course will enable us to achieve these goals. The impact this course will result in is to create a fun, rich, well resourced, authentic and engaging environment for our children to learn Spanish.

This project will see the fusion of two innovative pedagogies to help secure equality of access and provision for young people from refugee and/or migrant backgrounds or those for whom the language of instruction is not their first language.  A key aim is to equip these young people with the skills and competences to increase employment opportunities, enabling them to contribute positively to economic growth and help create a more socially cohesive and inclusive society within each partner country. \r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe dual focused approach of CLIL, where an additional language is used for the teaching and learning of both content and language simultaneously, promotes higher order thinking skills such as problem solving and reasoning and creative thinking.  Adopting a CLIL pedagogy affords teachers opportunities to exploit the synergies between mathematics and language learning to help combat the language gap. Common to both disciplines and a factor that can have a significant impact on teachers is their own emotional responses to them.  Mathematics can provoke anxiety and negative attitudes in the same way as learning a second language. Teachers can lack confidence in their own ability and lack experience of teaching in increasingly diverse school contexts.  A recent EU Commission in 2017 found that whilst there are a growing number of learners from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, teachers in most European countries remain largely homogenous.  \r\nWhen playing computer-based games, learners are practising and applying a set of 21st century skills that can be applied in the real world. (Prensky, 2006).  Learning does not just involve acquiring knowledge and content, game-based resources can offer a different way to engage and interact with this content and promotes different ways of thinking, as well as inspiring creativity, interest and social interaction. (Squire, 2011).  The problem solving elements embedded within the games along with a narrative thread, require the learners to engage with a series of challenges or quests where they assess situations, analyse information, make decisions and decide on a course of action and respond to the consequences of their actions in order to progress through the different stages of the game, all of which are key to cognitive development.\r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s focus on GBL will help to ensure greater equity for all learners, enabling access and opportunities to develop their digital literacy skills, contributing to a \u2018narrowing of the gap.\u2019 These digital literacy skills are essential for a 21st century workforce and will enable all learners to contribute positively to social cohesion, economic growth and sustainability.  \r\n\r\nImpact/results\r\nCombining Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and game-based learning (GBL) within a mathematics context, will result in significant linguistic gains with students/learners having opportunities to engage with and exposure to the language of instruction within a meaningful and purposeful context.  The GBL resources require students and learners to engage with and access the language to process and assimilate the mathematical concepts, leading to a more secure and deeper understanding.  Through engagement with the GBL resources, students/learners will have opportunities to develop their digital and linguistic competences, which in turn will begin to address the current digital and language gap that exists within students/learners from a refugee and/or migrant background. \r\n\r\nIncreasingly, schools and teachers lack the resources and expertise to fully meet the diverse needs of students/learners from migrant backgrounds or students that do not have the language of instruction as their first language.  This often results in student/learner disengagement, leading to poor or low attainment when compared to their peers. The innovative practices encouraged through this project and development of the GBL resources, will contribute to a narrowing of the attainment gap and promote inclusive practice. Student/learner participants engagement with these innovative and GBL resources will secure gains in their key digital and language skills and competences.  Increased competence in numeracy, digital literacies and communication will facilitate more positive contributions to future economic growth and prosperity and help create a more socially cohesive and inclusive society within the participating EU countries.\r\n\r\n A longer-term objective of the project is to provide a blueprint to enable schools and teachers to capitalise on and maximise the potential of innovative pedagogical tools to increase student/learner engagement, to enhance digital and language learning and to narrow the attainment gap, promoting inclusive practice, social justice and equal opportunities for all.", "http://www.cyber-smart.co.uk", "THE MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA203-048071_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BL2"}
