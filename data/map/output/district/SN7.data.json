However, footprints may also be considered as the literal traces left by students and teachers as they meet and cooperate together. \r\n\r\nThis project aims at increasing the students' awareness of environmental problems and make them develop practical skills which will allow them to adopt a responsible attitude as individuals, and future professionals. Therefore, by leaving their real footprints on Europe, they will work together and consider solutions to reduce their carbon footprint. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses  secondary school students and adults through the involvement of the local community. The activities will take place in our respective institutions, in the local communities and, in the virtual place through the use of digital means of cooperation and dissemination. \r\n\r\nThe implementation will follow a progression from awareness to action. Through the sharing of information on energy production and on the carbon footprint of individuals within the partnership, we hope to raise this awareness. We will drive the project towards different types of action including artistic ones. \r\n\r\nThe students will be involved  during lessons and in specific groups which will be constituted as part of the project. Different subjects will be involved (physics, languages, electronics, drama, geography). \r\n\r\nThe partnership will use English as a cooperation language. By gathering students from northern Europe (Finland, France, the United Kingdom and Poland) and southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Turkey) we wish to make them overcome prejudices in order to work together and learn from their peers.", "http://www.fcc.oxon.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-FR01-KA219-015198_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SN7"}
