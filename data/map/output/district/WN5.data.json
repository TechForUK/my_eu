With continued European growth in demand for water, finite reservoirs of readily-treatable water, rising energy costs and increased environmental legislation, EU industry is experiencing significant competitive threats with regard to cost-efficient supply and treatment of water.\n\nMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) utilise electrochemically-active microbes to convert the inherent energy of organic chemical bonds to electrical energy. MFCs encompass unique features that offer advantages for the treatment of wastewater, including: efficient electricity generation; minimal sludge formation; operation at low temperature; and modular cell design, enabling operation at small scale and customisation to specific end-user requirements.\n\nA core group of SMEs have identified a unique opportunity to advance MFC technology for industrial wastewater treatment, thereby generating sustainable and competitive business growth. Key innovations include MFC integration with photocatalytic advanced oxidation and a membraneless MFC air cathode design; and a scalable cost-efficient MFC and architecture design incorporating innovative process monitoring & control strategies. System features and benefits include:\n\n- Capital cost equivalence with existing aerobic treatment solutions\n- Significant operational cost savings, realised through:\n- Recovery of organic content as electrical energy & achieving system sustainability (self-powering);\n- Enhanced treatment efficiency enabling water reuse for on-site non-potable applications;\n- Significant cost reductions for sludge disposal and treated wastewater discharge to sewer\n- Flexible design and operation customised to specific end-user (sector) requirements and enabling treatment of wastewaters of varying composition and containing hazardous micropollutants\n\nThe project will result in a pilot-scale MFC system demonstrated for a target industrial wastewater.

The main aim of the club's Academy is to scout and develop players who will potentially reach professional status. However, regardless of the level of success achieved in football, Apprentices receive advice and education that provide a solid platform from which they can move forward and make sound decisions in life. The framework for this education is the Advanced Apprentice in Sporting Excellence (AASE) programme, a unique sporting vocational qualification for young people with the realistic potential to achieve excellence in sport. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this project is to enhance and improve the vocational training and development of Apprentices at WAFC. Working with host partner Odense BK in Denmark, the project will also aim to provide greater exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices upon completion of the programme. The project will have 3 overarching strategic objectives: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Facilitating the transfer of European training methods, development environments, techniques and philosophies into both the WAFC AASE programme and Apprentices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Exposing Apprentices to the European opportunities in both sport and other careers so these can be explored and more readily understood, accepted and pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Embedding LLP principles into the training and development programme and working cultures in order to equip Apprentices with the aptitude and skills to pursue employment, either within sport or outside of it, throughout their career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants will be the circa 20 (male) Apprentices undertaking the WAFC AASE programme in the 2015/16 football season (i.e. the 2014 and 2015 cohorts). These Apprentices are selected primarily on the basis of their football ability and therefore incorporate a wide range of academic abilities, socioeconomic circumstances and ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the work placement activities will take place at the Odense BK, including:\r\n\r\n- Regular training sessions to address the defined sports performance targets. \r\n\r\n- Games versus high quality Danish youth teams.\r\n\r\n- Daily feedback and evaluation sessions to confirm goal setting/reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOdense BK has outstanding links at a local, regional and national level which will enable WAFC to enhance the work placement activities of participants. For example:\r\n\r\n- Access to top flight Danish football teams, FCV Vikings and S\u00f8nderjyskE.\r\n\r\n- A visit to the Universtiy of Southern Denmark.\r\n\r\n- Observation of a live Superliga fixture. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAFC will use the principles of the European Quality Charter for Mobility to set goals and define tasks for the key elements of the project:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE: production of clear and accessible resources.\r\n\r\n2) LEARNING PLAN: clearly defining the project objectives and the role of each partner in achieving them.\r\n\r\n3) PERSONALISATION: pre-visit assessment of participants' desired learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n4) PREPARATION: a structured preparation programme tailored to individual needs.\r\n\r\n5) LANGUAGE: provision of formal and informal language training.\r\n\r\n6) LOGISTICS: a formal contract to be signed by both parties outlining practical and logistical responsibilities.\r\n\r\n7) MENTORING: provision of suitably qualified staff to facilitate achievement of individual goals and ensure integration.\r\n\r\n8) RECOGNITION: delivery of formal instruments to recognise individual learning outcomes.\r\n\r\n9) EVALUATION: comprehensive and objective evaluation of all aspects of the project.\r\n\r\n10) RESPONSIBILITIES: agreement by all parties on their roles and responsibilities in the successful delivery of the project, formalised in writing via a Memorandum of Understanding and individual participant Learning Plans. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impacts on participants are expected to include:\r\n\r\n- Achievement of recognised qualifications (e.g. BTEC L1 Work Skills). \r\n\r\n- Development of life skills and experience that can be utilised throughout participants' education and careers.\r\n\r\n- Enhanced cultural and linguistic skills, facilitating openness to new opportunities both in the UK and Europe.\r\n\r\n- Improved knowledge and understanding of the European opportunities in sport and other careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impacts on WAFC are expected to include:\r\n\r\n- Enhancement of the WAFC AASE programme both in terms of improved technical sporting quality of Apprentices and coaches, and also Apprentice achievement rates. \r\n\r\n- Implementation of best practice across the WAFC AASE programme and also the wider Football League AASE programme.\r\n\r\n- Improved exit and progression opportunities for Apprentices, both within sport and outside of it, and in the UK and Europe.", "http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk", "Wigan Athletic AFC Ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000309_coordinator"], ["7LP", "TEACH CVI", "Positive Eye Ltd", 134915.0, "The background of this project is that several professionals were working together on an EU project and identified the need for development of training and materials of educators of children with cerebral visual impairment. Since then the project idea has developed and the group became bigger because it's necessary to connect health care and education professionals together to address this area of need. Therefore the group behind this project comes from a cross sector of professionals that are all connected to the vision field in some way. \r\nThe objectives of this project are to produce training and teaching materials for teachers, a scanning tool and guidelines for health care and educational professionals. The project group has seen that this kind of training, tools and guidelines are lacking in the European environment of vision. \r\n\r\nThe number of project partners are seven and the profile of them are various. \r\nThe National Institute for the Blind is experienced in participating in projects nationally and internationally and will be responsible for leading the project. Positive Eye is a training company that will be responsible for developing the seminars (where we train the teacher advisor)  it is to be held for professionals across Europe and the partnership organizations. The Royal Blind School - Edinburgh .  will be used as a pilot school to try out the resources. This allows the products developed by the partnership to be tried and tested with the teachers and the students with cerebral visual impairment. SPSM - the National Agency for Special Needs Education and Schools is a Research Centre for children with vision loss due to brain damage. SPSM conducts special needs vision assessments and educational advice. They will be responsible for gathering information for the project and pilot the screening and guidelines and other resources that will be put forward. The University of LEUVEN is to be involved in the project and will be represented by Prof Dr Els Ortibus. Dr. Els Ortibus who is a leading specialist in CVI within Europe and will be responsible for creating a screening tool for cerebral visual impairment. ChildVision, Dublin, is Ireland\u2019s National Education Centre for Blind and Visually Impaired children and young people. ChildVision will fulfil the internal moderation function, ensuring through specific methodological means that the ongoing evaluation ensures the project remains on target, in terms of generating an end result with the potential to improve teaching strategies and benefit learners. The Icelandic Diagnostic Center is known for their extensive knowledge of children with disabilities. A paediatrician from the centre who is one of the most experienced doctors in the field in Iceland at working with children with visual impairment  will have on their responsible for developing guidelines for health and educational professionals in partnership with University of Leuven. \r\n\r\nThe activities that are going to be supported by this project is intellectual output of knowledge of cerebral vision impairment. This is done by making a educational resources, training materials and seminar for teachers. \r\n\r\nThe methodology used in carrying out the project will be a typical project management methodology. 1. Initiation, 2.  planning and design, 3. execution, 4. monitoring and control and 5. closing. We have already begun in the first steps of the project where we have already initiated the idea and started to plan it with budget control, scope and responsibilities. It's not until we have our first meeting where the execution of the project begins where we will over a three year period work on the resource material, web site, develop the screening and the guidelines, host a multiplier event and workshops in our own countries. \r\n\r\nWe envisage that through our project there will be awareness raising in Europe that we can help to fulfill a need for special training for teachers working with students with cerebral visual impairment and that we can help to fulfill that need with our training material, screening and guidelines. Through our work we hope health care and educational professionals will be more interested and have increased knowledge in cerebral visual impairment and more children will be identified and receive the help they need for their disability. It is well known that children that don't recognize their fellow students because of things like face blindness experience barriers.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of the project is that the knowledge of CVI will be included in the training of teachers that work with students with CVI and they will no longer be thought to not have the ability to read or write, their right for literacy will be the same as fellow students in the school system.", "http://www.positiveeye.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-IS01-KA201-013160_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WN5"}
