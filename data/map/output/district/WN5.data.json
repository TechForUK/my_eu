With continued European growth in demand for water, finite reservoirs of readily-treatable water, rising energy costs and increased environmental legislation, EU industry is experiencing significant competitive threats with regard to cost-efficient supply and treatment of water.\n\nMicrobial Fuel Cells (MFCs) utilise electrochemically-active microbes to convert the inherent energy of organic chemical bonds to electrical energy. MFCs encompass unique features that offer advantages for the treatment of wastewater, including: efficient electricity generation; minimal sludge formation; operation at low temperature; and modular cell design, enabling operation at small scale and customisation to specific end-user requirements.\n\nA core group of SMEs have identified a unique opportunity to advance MFC technology for industrial wastewater treatment, thereby generating sustainable and competitive business growth. Key innovations include MFC integration with photocatalytic advanced oxidation and a membraneless MFC air cathode design; and a scalable cost-efficient MFC and architecture design incorporating innovative process monitoring & control strategies. System features and benefits include:\n\n- Capital cost equivalence with existing aerobic treatment solutions\n- Significant operational cost savings, realised through:\n- Recovery of organic content as electrical energy & achieving system sustainability (self-powering);\n- Enhanced treatment efficiency enabling water reuse for on-site non-potable applications;\n- Significant cost reductions for sludge disposal and treated wastewater discharge to sewer\n- Flexible design and operation customised to specific end-user (sector) requirements and enabling treatment of wastewaters of varying composition and containing hazardous micropollutants\n\nThe project will result in a pilot-scale MFC system demonstrated for a target industrial wastewater. AquaCell will generate ~\u20ac40 million business growth for its SMEs within a 3-year period creating 94 jobs; and has the potential to benefit >29,700 major water using SMEs within the wider European manufacturing sector.", 281922.0, 1263284.0, "AQUACELL", null, null, null, null, "http://www.atguv.com", null, "fp7_96985_984330102"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WN5"}
