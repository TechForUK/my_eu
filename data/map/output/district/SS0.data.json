The proposed training would provide this.\r\n\r\nOur objectives include going further than government introduction of the MFL strand to begin in September 2014 in KS2 by continuing MFL teaching in KS1 and broadening MFL teaching in KS2 to include language strands across the curriculum.\r\n\r\nWe propose that 20 members of our staff take part in language teaching training abroad and that they deciminate their acquired skills and expertise among the rest of our staff.  Those included would be teaching and teaching support staff as well as Senior Managers.  Senior Managers would have a overview of teachers experience in MFL practice and raised levels of expectation.  \r\n\r\nHalf term language training in the country of the language we will be delivering across our primary years.  This will be delivered by reputable European  training providers that our L.E.A. have worked with for a number of years.  Their courses incorporate intensive immersion, including giving staff the chance to benefit from immersion in the culture of the language as well as intensive pure language and language teaching methodology classes.   Our aim is to raise our staff and enable them to  better deliver language learning, which is a government priority from 2014.  \r\nWe also want to send every senior member of staff on training abroad which helps them to understand how schools can be managed in different ways.  We want them to learn about strategies to improve performance which are used in other EU countries in order to understand what other systems do and have context in order to judge what we do and improve on it.  \r\n\r\nTraining providers will deliver the training in situ, while participants from our school will be expected to engage fully with the training delivered.For the most part,communication will be electronic.  Training providers are experienced in delivering inservice activities for school staff and will monitor the progress of our participants.  Participants will be in touch with school managers and governors, our L.E.A. level international support officer and with the UK National Agencies for Erasmus + in order to report on progress and any problems with the programme being delivered.  \r\n\r\nOur  teachers should have an enhanced and increased confidence to teach languages and will have been inspired by learning about different methodological approaches.  We know from experience that when teachers in our school have returned from having this training abroad, that their language proficiency has improved even from such a short course, due to its intensity. \r\nWe expect our school's leaders and future leaders to have fresh insights and ideas to contribute to the way our school is run. As  a result, we expect our school to become more of a 'learning organisation'.  We hope to have staff that can view our school in a more European way and in a context that is wider than our current experience.  \r\nWe hope these activities will positively affect the European dimension of our school generally. It will enthuse our staff  and continue to  engage them.  \r\n\r\nThe impact on pupils, teachers and other staff and on the school overall will be an enhanced understanding and appreciation of the European community and their place within it.", "http://www.thewestboroughschool.co.uk", "The Westborough Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002240_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SS0"}
