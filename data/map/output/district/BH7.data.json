Hence, the project aims to encourage innovative approaches, cohesion between teachers and students, and the due diligence of preventing student drop out and teacher/student unaccountability, by means of accessing ICT technology stimuli within The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Moreover, the project\u2019s goal is on the one hand, to encourage the team to use the communicative and cognitive resources in spite of all the bureaucratic and legislative tensions taking place at the moment and, on the other hand, to support the involved parties into having the necessary pleasure of learning through Erasmus Plus.\r\n Undoubtedly, there will be linguistic and intercultural benefits for the eight Romanian teachers currently teaching at elementary and high school level who will receive the scholarship at \u2018Coll\u00e8ge International de Cannes\u2019 from France. Their selection consists of four different subjects/workshops: 1. It is said that; 2. The fairy tale in oral examination; 3. Analysing literary masterpieces; 4. Intercultural Issues.  The Romanian trainees will use the fairy tale techniques as tool for oral and written expression in integrating cultural topics in order to revise their \u2018in vivo\u2019 experience, irrespectively of the native tongue used.  A series of teaching aids (poems, photography, video document, theatrical expression) and artistic and cultural assets (songs, painting, music, and literature) are being tested in this project, fact which enables the accumulation of more methodological methods in FLE. The later mentioned ideas associate directly culture and arts in pedagogy and, hence, offer security, motivation and dynamism in the teaching-learning process. The CEFR  content and performance language descriptors will serve as viable reference assets. The apprenticeship is focused on a set of practical assignments that are to be accomplished either individually or in a team, in order to demonstrate to what extend are arts designed to allow the usage of language, by means of associating multiple skills in the teaching-learning process. The cultural and artistic contemporaneousness will influence the schedule of the activities. \r\nThe lexical, grammatical and phonetic properties of language itself will represent a priority, as well as associating logically complementary leaning skills. The CEFR  content and performance language descriptors will serve as viable reference assets. The last workshop is aimed at establishing an inventory of skills, abilities and cultural assets gained through the course, but also at deciding the means of adapting these in the Romanian context. The trainees will be encouraged to stay in touch with each other and with their trainer in order to facilitate further sharing of teaching methods and principles.\r\nAnother group of eight Romanian teachers will apply for the course taking place in Great Britain, at Richard Language College in Bournemouth on British Culture and Civilization. Their aim is to have a better understanding of the ethnicity and multiculturalism facets that exist in the British educational system. Gaining experience signifies: planning and applying activities; involvement in the students\u2019 assessing process; students\u2019 monitoring; attending extracurricular activities with students and teachers; establishing ways of approaching subjects in an interdisciplinary and multicultural context. \r\nAs a result, the teachers will create an optional course when they return at home, entitled Identity/Otherness, where they will share their acquisitions and teachings aids gained in the apprenticeship, that made them embrace the pleasure of learning. The target of this course will be:  the linguistic and science teachers, but also the students and the parents interested in gaining insight on the apprenticeship. An outcome would be that fact that \u2018Ion Luca Caragiale\u2019 College will embrace a new pan-European image thanks to the Erasmus Plus initiative and more and more teachers from Prahova county and Romania will be interested in applying for this type of course.", "http://www.shadows.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-RO01-KA101-001112_1"], ["6BQ", "Wi\u0119cej ni\u017c umiej\u0119tno\u015bci", "Flavours School of Cookery", 124155.0, "The main idea of the project \"More then skills\"is turning  the students of Zesp\u00f3\u0142 Szk\u00f3\u0142 Gastronomiczno-Us\u0142ugowych to improve their vocational skills abroad and the need for the students, and the future graduates of such expieriences, knowledge and language skills that will help them to start their adult professional life.

Students from the college are generally drawn from a locality which has a poor socio-economic background with consequent limited linguistic facility and their opportunities to travel to or even communicate with students from within Europe are certainly hindered by this. Many of our students lack the necessary language skills in their own language to deal effectively with content learning and even when English is the mother tongue, the language of the home and the playground are often inadequate for learning. Modern Foreign Languages teaching has been highlighted as a priority within our School Development Plan. The focus for this includes curriculum (teaching, teaching methods and learning),  innovation, independent learning and improving students' performance in the UK  Baccalaureate.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the project:\r\nThe project will allow us to further the aims our Development Plan which has a considerable focus on globalization, internationalism and sensitivity towards foreign cultures and languages.  We aim to bring the centrality of language skills in effective learning into the consciousness of all staff across the school.  The competences acquired by participating staff will enable them to be more sensitive to migrant students ,all students learning a foreign language, and  native speaker students from the our catchment area.  We wish to use the successful experience of CLIL teaching in our EAL department to develop CLIL in mainstream teaching to native speakers.  This project will increase not only teaching staff personal competences, skills and sensitivities, but  will  impact upon our students' foreign and native linguistic competences and cultural sensitivity to diversity.  \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of applicants:\r\n32 staff in total across the whole school with a range of teaching experience and responsibilities but to include Subject Teachers, Language Teachers, Assistant Teachers, Pastoral Heads, Middle Academic Leaders, Senior Teachers and school Academic Management (including the Executive Head Teacher) and a School Trustee  who collectively have the capability and means to disseminate results and affect wider change within the school and beyond.\r\n\r\nActivities/Methodology used in carrying out the project:\r\nTraining/Activities will vary according to the Development Plan and the participants' training needs,  but will come from this list: Intensive Language learning, Methodology of Teaching French or Spanish as a Foreign Language, Language & Methodology, Language and Culture, Bi-Component Courses including school attachment, three-Day Study visit for senior school leaders and European Programme Coordinators or staff involved in Erasmus+ activities, Spanish for Business, Spanish Language and Flamenco, Spanish Language and Salsa, Spanish Language and Cookery. \r\n\r\nAnticipated results:\r\nStudents' conception of the importance of speaking another language is heightened, their achievements in language qualifications increase and their understanding and awareness of cultural diversity improves. Migrant students have access to CLIL based materials resulting in better outcomes.  Teachers' other language competences increase, their confidence in using the spoken word in the target language improves, their ability to deliver CLIL based curricula and schemes of work increases and their ability to participate in International learning is enabled. Project Results will help to overcome linguistic problems encountered by native speakers in subject learning.\r\n\r\nImpact envisaged/Long term benefits:\r\nImpact on the school:\r\nAwareness of the need to speak another language for educational, cultural and employment purposes will have a positive impact on the school's ethos, a greater uptake of second language learning and of cultural exchange visits. Vocational choices will drive a demand outside of school into the wider community. More awareness in our parent community will enable a positive outlook which impacts on curriculum choice.  The importance of language learning for inclusive International learning, liaison and cooperation will permeate the work that already takes place.  International projects that are impeded by mono linguistic dialogue should benefit and the opportunities to participate in further project work will be enhanced.

The participating teachers would also collect the tasks, presentations and experiences and publish lesson plans on the websites of the partner schools in both English and their respective mother tongue. The teachers will annotate and supplement the students\u2019 work. The activities, the exercises, the link to the short story in English and in its original language, the lesson plans will be freely available on the Internet for anyone interested.\r\nWe envisage improvement in our students\u2019 reading, social, ICT, language and organisational skills as well. The students will become more motivated for reading in their mother tongue and in English as well, they will learn about working on an international team. Intercultural dialogue will make them more open-minded and knowledgeable.\r\nThe participating schools will be more international, will gain more experience in organising international meetings and working with their colleagues from other countries.\r\nThe materials produced in the project will include tasks, exercises, lesson plans, presantations on the short stories read by the students.\r\nPotentially, the benefits of Pangea will outlast the duration of the project. The materials produced during the transnational meetings will remain posted on the six websites of the participating schools so that teachers at other institutions will also be able to use them. We will also disseminate the results and the materials to our national and international partners as well.", "http://www.avonbourne.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-HU01-KA201-002274_3"], ["6NY", "Competences for Employability: Learning about Employability to Generate Actions and Competences for  Young people", "Avonbourne Academy", 55163.0, "Context/Background:\r\nIncreasingly, young people are prevented from becoming economically and socially mobile through a lack of globally recognized employability skills. \r\nAvonbourne, a nationally and internationally famous  organization with many years experience of Enterprise Education applied to develop a set of entrepreneurial competences and a suite of transversal employability skills for students of compulsory school age with its Czech and Dutch partners.  \r\nFrom this,  the partners developed pedagogical practice and curricula design which enables students to acquire these skills and to prepare them for vocational training,  education post compulsory school age and the job market . \r\nThe transnational project responded to  a need for a common understanding of employability skills amongst educators and employers globally.
