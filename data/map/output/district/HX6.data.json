These tools will then be used in any of our 5 different study courses to help both native and non-native students enhance their linguistic and scientific know how/skills.The latest ICT technologies will be largely used to boost our pupils\u2019 motivation and pleasure of learning Maths in L2 and applying it to the learning of other related school subjects. TwinSpace will be used by the project teachers for internal communication and to share ideas, materials and results with relevant stakeholders. The two teachers of English will support the team throughout the whole project life cycle; they will be particularly involved in preparatory activities (ESP course focused on classroom management and mathematical language), in itinere (backing of teachers in mobility, preparing teaching materials in L2 and implementing learning modules in class) and in the final project evaluation phase (skills assessment).Finally, having a highly motivated and fully working MAKTS team will represent a precious long-term resource to be used as a: - reliable operational tool for planning and supervising further CLIL activities within our school;- reference point for the implementation of similar experiences in other schools of our territory.", "http://www.rvhs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT02-KA101-023311_2"], ["1DF", "Happiness in Lifelong Learning", "Ryburn Valley High School", 137485.0, "The overriding objectives in this two-year Erasmus+ \"Happiness in Lifelong Learning\" project is that the students` get experience of success in their future learning and that students will continue in the educational system. \r\n\r\nThe students` active participation will promote and create the basis to bring \"happy learning\" into their life and the classroom. \r\n\r\nChildren's Parliament has a significant position in this project, because they are also working with topics of the well-beeing and happiness in laearning. We expect that the idea behind the Children`s Parliament  will give inspiration and share knowledge and experience about how to create motivating teaching and learning. And we expect that relations across the borders will promote future mutual visits, study tours, and maybe even inspire to education abroad in the European Community.\r\n\r\nWe want to find out why and how happiness is important in the learning invironment and the well-beeing of the students and use the results of this project for future learning and teaching in the schools. \r\n\r\nWe want to provide a breeding ground for a learning and teaching environment based on \"happiness\" i.e. an innovative, creative, inspiring and motivating environment for students and teachers that will generate a successful learning outcome and also keep students from dropping out of the educational system in the long term future.\r\nThe project partners will be primary and secondary schools from seven  European countries: Denmark, Slovenia, Germany, Turkey, UK, Greece, and Portugal. Some of the partners have participated in other Comenius projects and others have not. The whole project is based on a close relationship between the partners. \r\n\r\nWe want to make activities in the project that have a starting point in the \"happy\" way of learning in \"Lifelong Learning\". The activities will have a positive approach both to life and to learning.\r\nSharing happiness and learning about happiness in other cultures will give students a wider perspective in life and in school. \r\nAt all  mobilities there will be a workshop that will either start or finish one of the subprojects of the overriding project.\r\n\r\nThe subprojects and activities that are focusing on children`s rights are:\r\n- Children`s rights and say\r\n- Children`s Parliament\r\n- Happy Birthday - celebrating the UNICEF (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) focusing on children`s\r\n  right to having an education\r\n- What makes students, parents, teachers and management \"happy\" at school? \r\nAnnex 2\r\n\r\nThe subprojects and activities that are focusing on the methodology: \r\n- A happy story\r\n- Creating a logo of \"happiness\"\r\n- A \"happy\" song\r\n- Happy birthday - how do we celebrate birthdays?\r\nAnnex 2\r\n\r\nThe subprojects and activities that are focusing on dissemination of experience among partner schools:\r\n- In mobilities partner schools present what they have worked with between mobilities\r\n- Each country`s mascot will travel to the other countries and tell happy stories about happiness in different contexts\r\nAnnex 4\r\n\r\n We will make interviews, questionnaires, observations, and tests to evaluate the impact of our activities.\r\n  \r\n We want to promote student`s social inclusion and \"happiness\" in their school-life, as well as in their lives outside school  \r\n as in their future education.\r\n We want to establish a teaching environment that will prevent students from dropping out from school early.\r\n  \r\n We will make a \"Curriculum for Happiness in Lifelong Learning\" to be disseminated widely: locally by the community and the local  \r\n media, nationally via school-websites, and internationally via ECTS.

Most of them regard education as not useful at all as leading them to quit studying and abandon school. Those two issues will be the leitmotifs to be understood and respected.  In this context, school should have an important role in developing non formal and informal learning giving expression to multiculturalist attitudes and the construction of personal fulfillment. To help teens make wise and fruitful decisions concerning their lives, we would like to involve students from our schools into the pan-European project called \u201cEmpower students with entrepreneurial skills \u201d. This project emphasises the build of \u2018skills for the 21st century\u2019, develop transversal skills such as entrepreneurship and highlights \u2018the ability to think critically, take initiative, problem solving and work collaboratively\u2019. These \u2018entrepreneurial skills\u2019 should be given particular attention, since they not only help to achieve concrete entrepreneurial activity, but also enhance the employability of young people in each partner\u00b4s country and in any European country. The priorities addressed by our project are: (i) Promoting the take-up of practical entrepreneurial experiences in education, training and youth work and (ii) Improving the attainment of young people, particularly those at risk of early school leaving which will be developed by seven schools in seven diverse countries \u2013 Portugal, France, England, Italy, Romania, Poland and Finland \u2013 whose learning and teaching profiles are different. So we defined four main key-Competences: (i) Raising awareness of cultural and geographical heritage of our regions; (ii) Getting to know the products\u00b4 features related to each region\u2019s natural environment; (iii) Becoming acquainted with the local range of industrial, commercial and handicraft associations; (iv) Developing \u2018the ability to think critically, take initiative, problem solving and work collaboratively\u2019 through creative entrepreneurship workshops. We believe that the most relevant topics our project deal with are the following: 1) Entrepreneurial learning - entrepreneurship education, 2) Creativity and culture and 3) ICT - new technologies - digital competences. To achieve them we established a mix methodology to develop this project Action-Research. This framework allows us to carry out the project into three action-cycles. Each cycle is strictly related to the going up of the project in the beginning of each new year. Thus we decided to have three transnational project meetings, attended only by school coordinators. To measure the quality of the project we will use different tools to collect data such as questionnaires, surveys and focus group targeted to students, parents, teachers and local community. The main results expected are: (i) Exhibitions of students works concerning to the past and present of their regions for different economic sectors and creativity and entrepreneurship; (ii) Reports on the attitude of students to entrepreneurial activities, the importance of formal education and  their needs; (iii) Films, publicity spots, presentations, models, photo albums and posters on the perspectives and news ideas of students in relation to regional development of products or particular economic sectors in their region; (iv) Website for other schools from our areas giving them information on how they can implement similar activities in their schools; (v) Form a group of students and teachers to present/share their knowledge in  regional and national schools. \r\nAs far as dissemination of the project the target groups will be students from different European schools, parents and community since being an entrepreneur in education also involves knowledge and share of good practices at national and international level. School websites, school papers, bulletin boards, exhibitions in school halls, libraries and others areas; Facebook, Etwinning and blogs, will be the internal and external privileged channels used to disseminate the project outcomes, whose the responsible for this phase of the project are the coordinators of each school partner. \r\nAt the end of the project we look forward to fostering the impact on key-Competences gained by:1. students \u2013 independence, discipline, creativity, tolerance and team work skills, creativity and entrepreneurship; Language development and ICT literacy; \r\n2. teachers \u2013 language and ICT improvements, team work and problem solving techniques; 3. community \u2013 improving cooperation with students\u2019 parents,  local authorities and other institutions and enhancing school prestige and popularity;\r\n4. school partners \u2013 cooperation, experience, motivation and opportunity to exchange professional experience and good practices.", "http://www.rvhs.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PT01-KA219-012924_6"], ["2BA", "I am a child and I do have rights!", "Bolton Brow Primary Academy", 72087.0, "Our project is the culmination of work done by 6 schools in 5 European countries, including one Special Needs School.
