Research areas include anatomy, musculoskeletal modelling, prevention and early identification of patients, epidemiology, biomechanical mechanisms, and intervention studies.\nThe KNEEMO training programme combines existing best practices from consortium members and is designed to equip researchers with skills and knowledge specific to the research field (KOA anatomy,  pathology and disease mechanisms, musculoskeletal modelling, functional assessment, KOA interventions), generic research skills (epidemiology, methodology, statistics, clinimetrics, ethics), and complementary training (entrepreneurship, project management, product development, intellectual property issues). At the individual level, training will be provided through direct research project supervision and intersectoral exchange visits and secondments. At the network level, regular workshops, courses, and summer schools will be scheduled. Additionally, web-based seminars will be provided and a social media virtual learning environment will be available for continuous supervision, peer-support and expert help.

Foot and ankle orthoses are an effective treatment for these conditions. However, the market is dominated by low cost mass produced products, craftsmanship built customised devices with delivery times &gt;15 days, and a limited range of computer-aided design and manufactured products. The objective of the A-FOOTPRINT project is to develop novel foot and ankle orthoses which are personalised for shape and biomechanical function and can be ready for patient use within 48 hours. The goal is to achieve improved fit and comfort, functionality, aesthetic appeal and ease of use with better clinical and cost effectiveness over state-of-the-art products. Innovative CAD tools will be developed and combined with rapid manufacturing to create complete geometric design freedom. This will be coupled with step change advances in personalisation by developing individual patient data from gait analysis and medical images to inform the design process, aided by biomechanical simulation to optimise functionality such as joint stabilisation and pressure distribution. Rapid manufacturing techniques will be used to develop novel customised orthotic components such as living hinges, variable stiffness and fine resolution cushioning to enable better personalised function. Setting new industry standards, prototype devices will be evaluated by near pharmaceutical industry level controlled trials to further improve product knowledge.
