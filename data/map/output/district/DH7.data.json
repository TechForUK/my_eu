We want to prevent the development of school refusal or dropout of children because of not sufficient qualifications from the outset.\r\nThe support of creativity and key competences has to begin as early as possible. Our primary schools in Unna, Pisa, Palaiseau, Lanchester and Ajka go resume the preexperiences of the children from parental home and nursery school and promote these competences, so that they can change from primary to secondary schools without any difficulties. Because of this, the schools co-operate very closely with each other and build a network.\r\nIn our partner schools there are many children from less educated and socially disadvantaged families. \r\nMany children have a migration background or special educational needs. In all partner schools there are children with special needs in learning, social and emotional development, mental development, language or physical and motor development. The schools are inclusive and develop strategies to promote all children in their development. This can succeed particularly in the creative field. In addition, many children are threatened by educational disadvantages because they have no access to literature, art, museums or computer in their families. \r\nThe main aims of the project are the support of creativity and problem solution competence, the support of cultural awareness and capability of cultural expression, the support of first language and foreign language skills, computer competence, learning competence, social competence, initiative and enterprise competence.\r\nIn our project, the children develop curiosity, openness, experimental joy, creative handling of technologies, materials and tools and economical dealing with resources, e.g., concerning time, material or work routines. They produce individual and original results, e.g., artistic products and processes and tell about them in conversations and texts. Moreover, they develop expression and explanatory power of an artistic solution, and the ability to plan and realise contributions for common projects with other children. In doing so, they highly strengthen their verbal and written communication and reflection competences in their mother tongue.\r\nThe children of all partner schools experiment in interdisciplinary lessons, in projects and study groups in the fields \"Coloured shapes, graphic and spatial shapes, shapes with technical-visual media, discussion about pictures and objects of artists of their home country and other European countries\".

We took this quote and discussed the priorities of our schools and we talked about how writing can help promote cohesive communication across languages and cultures. Throughout history, writing has allowed people to communicate cultures, ideas and opinions. Nations and governments have been formed through written communication. Also, friendships and partnerships have been nurtured through written communication. From hieroglyphics to graffiti, from poetry to songs, writing and mark-making has always formed part of the communication process across borders and through time. We have an exciting opportunity to not only promote writing in our own schools, but to share this across Europe and indeed across the universe!\r\n\r\nThe main aim of our project is to tackle under-acheivement in writing. All partners identified this as a need. We will tackle this by creating an imaginative and engaging scenario involving aliens visiting our schools and this will encourage children to want to write. They will have a purpose and their writing will be seen throughout the universe, not just by their teacher, who is usually their only reader. By creating these scenarios, we will involve the whole school community. Parents will be invited to write with their children, the local community will be invited to take part in workshops, and teachers will have the opportunity to share best practice not only in their own school, but across all the partner schools. School governors will be regularly updated the impact of the project on writing achievement in the school. This will be measured by teachers' assessments and will be compared with progress made before the launch of this project.\r\n\r\nGuided by the co-ordinating school in the UK, all partners will use the 'Timetable of Activities' to plan the specific activities in their schools in the correct timeframe. Each question will be \"owned\" by a named partner, who will ensure that it is appropriately planned and that the results are collated in a timely manner. \r\n- 'What do you read?' will be managed by the Finnish partner.\r\n- 'What do you write?' will be managed by the Cypriot partner.\r\n- ' What do you eat?' will be managed by the Polish partner.\r\n- 'What do you sing?' will be managed by the Turkish partner.\r\n- 'Who are you?' will be managed by the Spanish partner.\r\n\r\nThe overall review and reporting procedures will be managed by the co-ordinating school in the UK. Communication throughout will be through the eTwinning TwinSpace and this will be open and transparent. \r\n\r\nThe number one impact expected on participants is that children's ability to write for different purposes will improve and their achievement in writing will have positive results. This is the basis on which the project is based. The target groups for this will be the children involved in the project in the eight participating schools.\r\nFor the organisations involved, it is expected that educators' expertise in teaching writing will improve so that they can ensure that all children make progress regardless of their personal circumstances.\r\nThe pan-European nature of this project means that all stakeholders will benefit from exposure to the benefits of European working and to the value of a European community.
