Industrial feed gases and exhaust gases require a high purity to ensure durable processes and avoid pollution. The integration of MOFs into textile products will be used to develop air permeable personal protective clothing. For industrial and house-hold fuel cell reformer units novel MOF-based sulphur removal systems will be developed. 2) Safe delivery of highly toxic electronic grade gases (etching gases, dopants) is crucial for tool operation in semiconductor and solar industry. 3) Catalysis is an ecologically relevant and economically attractive technology. The replacement of liquid acids by solid state catalysts avoids the production of toxic liquid waste.

Nanostructured surfaces have the potential to improve efficiencies of cells by up to 25% (rel), having dramatic impact on commercial viability. Impact Area 2 focuses on biocidal surface structures. Increasing concerns about infections leading to the conclusion, that only multi-action approaches for control of infection transfer can be effective.

We will take a unique approach by translating a technique common in particle physics and the CMB to lensing: we will simulate images matched to observed galaxy positions and shapes, and vary lensing to accurately calibrate shapes. We will make the code public and use it to produce the final public DES shear catalogues. Theme 2: We will exploit my innovative and successful program of coordinated international challenges from shear measurement and apply it to mitigating galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA). I have shown that knowledge of IAs is essential for leveraging the potential of cosmic lensing for cosmology and described a mitigation method, but this needs to be tested on simulations. I will coordinate international IA simulation efforts and identify the optimum method for removing intrinsic alignments and apply it to the DES data. Theme 3: We have developed a skeleton software framework for cosmology, CosmoSIS. We will write modules for cosmology from imaging data incorporating the main systematic effects, and use CosmoSIS to produce the final constraints on cosmology from DES lensing. We will incorporate constraints on sterile neutrinos from particle physics for the first time. If the current tensions between cosmic lensing the CMB are confirmed by this work we will have discovered the need for new physics. Furthermore, the work in this proposal will place us in prime position to exploit the main cosmology surveys of the next decade (LSST, Euclid, WFIRST).", 1731513.0, 1731513.0, 1, 1, "COSMIC LENS", null, "http://www.manchester.ac.uk", null, "h2020_202580_999903840"], [1504224000000, 1661904000000, "Next Steps in Cosmology with CMB Spectral Distortions", "The University of Manchester", "The average spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has long been known to be extremely close to a perfect blackbody. Yet, several processes, standard and non-standard, exist that may cause deviations from a blackbody spectrum, commonly referred to as CMB spectral distortions. Classical distortion shapes are known as Compton-y and chemical potential (\u00b5-type) distortions; however, recently it has been shown that more general distortions can be created at redshifts 10^4 < z < 3\u00d710^5. This makes spectral distortions a unique and powerful probe of different early-universe processes. The immense potential of CMB spectral distortion measurements and their synergies with upcoming CMB anisotropy studies (Litebird, COrE\\, Stage-IV CMB) has identified them as an important future target, with several innovative experimental concepts (e.g., PIXIE, APSERa) being actively discussed by the cosmology community.\n\nThis proposal has one main goal: to transform the emerging field of CMB spectral distortions into a mature scientific discipline. The team will significantly expand and strengthen the spectral distortion science case with particular emphasis on novel time-dependent information from the recombination era (10^3 < z < 10^4) and various photon injection processes. By combining all available information, we will investigate what spectral distortions could teach us about early-universe physics and the cosmological ionization history. Novel foreground parameterizations and experimental setups will be studied and simulation pipelines will be developed. Our work could deliver new tests for inflation, reionization and particle physics as well as extend our ability to distinguish sources of different distortion signals in the presence of foregrounds.

Importantly, these signals enable tumour cells to engage additional signalling pathways not activated when oncogenic KRAS is expressed in homogeneous tumour cell cultures. Therefore, to fully appreciate tumour cell signalling, studies should be undertaken within the context of the tumour stroma. \nEarly stages of PDA display a gradual accumulation of mutations where activated KRAS is accompanied by loss of tumour suppressors CDKN2A, TP53 and SMAD4. Simultaneously, there is an accumulation of infiltrating stromal cells. To address how PDA cells differ in their interaction with the infiltrating stroma, we will use in vitro co-cultures to study how PDA cells with frequent genetic aberrations recruit and interact with host stromal cells. We will combine our unique methodologies for cell-specific labelling with global proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis to discern cell-specific signalling between tumour and stroma cells.

These activities will be prepared through exchange visits and workshops, and based on a comparative approach of best practices in different national educational settings. During the project phase we will seek further collaborators from universities and schools from outside the partnership.

Summarized results from the project will be published in professional journals.The proposed project builds on the extensive expertise of the partners regarding gender-equality activities in physics. The strategic partnership aims to extend existing networks beyond the national limits and make the disciplinary and cultural diversity of doing physics internationally visible. Diversity functions both as an objective and resource for developing and implementing equality-oriented initiatives in physics teaching and training. Thereby, we draw on the findings of gender studies in science, with a particular focus on physics, EU-wide as well as nationally. These studies have documented the professional cultures of physics in different locations and disciplinary specializations regarding their gender effects. Heightened awareness of the differences in the work areas of physicists, consciousness about the heterogeneous political and everyday contexts of scientific research, and knowledge about equality measures at European universities can provide pathways for women and other under-represented groups in physics to pursue their career and life plans. Identifying and opening up these opportunities is the central goal of this project.Establishing an appropriate network is a fundamental requirement to exploit this potential. The project\u2019s target groups and stakeholders comprise university students, researchers and teachers, representatives from science administration, educational policy and gender equality bodies as well as high-school teachers and their students. The activities of the strategic partnership will bring together actors at various levels (local, regional, national, EU-wide) and strengthen their collaboration. Over the course of the funding period, the partnership envisions gradually expanding its network involving more partners within the EU, esp. in Eastern Europe.

At the same time, across Europe, science subjects suffer low attendance and are often chosen away by students as soon as possible.

The project aims to improve the quality and relevance of education in geographical modelling by developing and diffusing e-tutorials, setting up an annual international intensive program for master' students of the partner universities and creating two-ways interactions between those two activities over 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe program is intended to attract the participation of many students and beginning scholars from geography and related disciplines from allover Europe and beyond via a digital platform where e-tutorials, using a variety of modeling tools and geographical topics, can be accessed.  A joint intensive workshop is then organised every year where the 30-35 master students from the partner institutions can benefit from the niche expertise of each partner to learn about the most recent geographical modelling approaches and tools. The workshop is also designed as a testbed for the e-tutorials creating along the project. This unique combination of e-tutorials and intensive workshop is a key characteristic of the project for avoiding the pitfalls of training with remote tools while still embracing the ICT turn and online opportunities. The careful development of e-tutorial will also contribute to the visibility of the partners in Europe as well as of geographical modelling methods and their wider adoption in research and practice.\r\n\r\nOverall, in the longer-run it is expected that the project will consolidate the network of European quantitative geographers and its capacity to deliver new understanding of spatial processes and innovative tools for policy makers and planners.

Its aim is to improve learning in the field, by contrasting methods. For three years 35 students will investigate the Mediterranean island of Gozo in a ten day field course. Coming from fields as diverse as Geography, Development Studies, Game Studies, Sociology, New Media Studies and Geographical Information Science they will be players in 'location based games', deployed to structure group-based and student-led investigations of Island Geography. Facilitated by academics and researchers from Manchester, Warwick, Utrecht, Olomouc and Malta the students will compare and contrast different research methods. Mapping games and more conventional research methods will be used. Students will present results of their investigations and begin to appreciate the significant differences that discipline and nationality bring to learning about Island Studies. Learning in the courses will be under the control of students, and staff will design subsequent courses in the light of the successes and failures of early encounters. Field practice will change and best practice will be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents will learn about mobile technologies in the field. They will share in game design through a 'game jam'. They will explore the potential of mobile mapping as a research tool and investigate the different assumptions that students bring to the activity.

Considering that these children were born into this \u2018information age\u2019, it is inevitable that this virtual World affects real life more and more each day. This kind of high usage rates brings about risk factors besides its positive contributions and numerous benefits. Recent studies also show that although children and teenagers are encouraged to use information technologies effectively, they don\u2019t receive satisfying education on how to protect themselves from the harmful aspects of the internet. Cyberbullying is not the most common problem that children face while using information technologies, but it is one of the most serious ones as it leads to long term negative effects like psychological problems, violence, absenteeism and early school leaving, poor marks, and poor social skills on children. Cyberbullying is repeated verbal or psychological harassment carried out by an individual or group against others on the internet base. \r\n\r\nWith this project, the partnership is planning to raise awareness of the society and to provide core knowledge and guidelines which can help students, parents, and teachers for avoiding the undesired results of cyberbullying. The project also aims to reveal different ways of motivating and engaging teenagers in safer use of internet. Our target group is 12-17 aged teenagers of which the majority consists of school age children.

Evidence from various sources clearly shows a shift from permanent forms of employment with fixed contracts to an employment situation in which musicians are self-employed and combine different professional activities in the form of a portfolio careers. As employment opportunities in the traditional areas of employment (orchestras, opera houses, etc.) are diminishing, chamber music is seeing a heightened significance on the international concert stage. \r\n\r\n2. Furthermore, chamber music is increasingly seen as a vital pedagogical tool for the training of transversal skills vital for the musician in the 21st century: team working, peer-learning and reflective practice are essential basic principles for chamber music practice, which will support musicians to prepare themselves to be reflective practitioners in their future portfolio careers. \r\n\r\nHigher music education institutions have been slow in adapting their curricula to these new realities so far. This consortium sees chamber music as a tool to modernise higher education in classical music and intends to initiate this process through the following innovative activities:\r\n\r\n1.

Joint staff training events for teachers taking place twice with different groups of teachers that will develop new approaches to assessment as developed in one of the working groups and to comparing international standards of educational and artistic outcomes. During these events teaching staff will be trained to become international external examiners for final recitals and other moments of assessment in chamber music.\r\n\r\n4. The development of a joint European Master\u2019s programme in chamber music through a series of working group meetings. This joint European programme will ensure that the expertise available in the partner institutions will be pooled into a programme of the highest educational and artistic quality, and provide future sustainability to its activities through the recognition by national and European quality assurance frameworks and a more structured future use of ERASMUS+ funding for joint Master\u2019s programmes.\r\n\r\n5. The activities and outcomes of this partnership will be evaluated through various evaluation tools so that evidence is created that the cross-border approach of the consortium is truly providing an added-value. Cross-border approach will be shown as more effective than the development of the institutions at national level only. The outcomes of the project will be widely disseminated through the network and activities of the AEC, and demonstrate the principle of cross-border cooperation as an effective tool for curricular innovation to the European sector of higher music education as a whole.\r\n                       \r\nThese activities will lead to improved curricula in the partner institutions that are informed by the latest teaching and learning approaches and the expertise from professional partners, and are therefore better tailored to the current reality of the music profession.
