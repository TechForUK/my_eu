However, some plants use a super-charged photosynthetic mechanism called C4 photosynthesis. The C4 pathway is used by the most productive vegetation and crops on Earth. In addition to faster photosynthesis, C4 plants demand less water and less nitrogen. Overall, our aim is to introduce the characteristics of C4 into C3 crops. This would increase yield, reduce land area needed for cultivation, decrease irrigation, and limit fertiliser applications. If current C3 crops could be converted to use C4 photosynthesis, large economic and environmental benefits would ensue from both their increased productivity and the reduced inputs associated with the C4 pathway. It is important to note that the huge advances in agricultural production associated with the Green Revolution were not associated with increases in photosynthesis, and so its manipulation remains an unexplored target for crop improvement both for food and biomass. Even partial long-term success would have significant economic and environmental benefits. Efficient C4 photosynthesis would be achieved by alterations to leaf development, cell biology and biochemistry. Although initially we will be using model species such as rice and Arabidopsis we envisage rapid transfer of technological advances into mainstream EU crops, such as wheat and rape, that are used both for food and fuel. We will build capacity for C4 research in Europe in this area by the training of future generations of researchers. To achieve this aim we need to increase our understanding of the basic biology underlying the C4 pathway. Our specific objectives will therefore address fundamental aspects of C4 biology that are needed for a full understanding the pathway.\n\nSpecifically we aim:\n1.

Very recently, the European rail industry has started showing signs of recovery after a long period of steady decline. The technological advances in train design during the last few decades have led to the manufacturing of faster and more comfortable trains making rail transport a more attractive option for passengers in comparison to other means of transportation. The need for the society to employ greener transportation policies is expected to further enhance the role of rail transport in the global economy. Today rail networks across Europe are getting busier with trains travelling at higher speeds, carrying more passengers and heavier axle loads than ever before. The combination of these factors has put considerable pressure on the existing infrastructure, leading to increased demands in inspection and maintenance of rail assets. The expenditure for inspection and maintenance has thus, grown steadily over the last few years without however being followed by a significant improvement of the industry\u2019s safety records. A large proportion of all equipment related accidents in the rail industry is due to failed train wheels and axles. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that catastrophic failure of a wheel or axle may result in very serious derailments, such as the one that took place in Eschede, Germany in 1998, causing loss of life, injuries, severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the tracks, unnecessary costs, and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public.

The challenge is to retain copper nano-particles in a structure that provides antibacterial functionality, but prevents leaching.The CuVito consortium believes that the silsesquioxane structure, formed using Vitolane technology is the answer.\nSilsesquioxanes have the formula RSiO1.5 (where R is an organic ligand), and form cage or ladder structures.They confer hardness and abrasion resistance to coatings and, by selecting appropriate R groups (e.g. acrylate, glycidoxy) can chemically bond to the organic resin in the formulation controlling cross-link density to enhance durability.Hence silsesquioxanes are inherently suited to use in coatings for surfaces which require regular cleaning.Silsesquioxanes have been available for some years but at a prohibitively high cost, due to the complexity of manufacture.Vitolane technology is an alternative, cost effective production route which has been patented and is currently being scaled up commercially.It has a unique processing feature in allowing simple selection of R groups and it is proposed to use this to bond directly to the copper nanoparticles, resolving the issue of leaching.The objectives of the project of the project are:\n1.Develop a copper nano-particle production process\n2.Functionalise silsesquioxanes with copper using Vitolane technology\n3.Produce a commercially acceptable coating\n4.Validate coating in a hospital environment", 439772.0, 1685792.0, 4, 8, "CUVITO", "http://www.cuvito.eu", "http://www.twi.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156438.jpg", "fp7_97537_999912764"], [1519862400000, 1646006400000, "Multi-physics mOdelling of high Temperature engIne ValvEs", "Twi Limited", "Aim: Predictive assessment of the functionality, performance and controllability of pneumatic aircraft engine valves through modelling of elementary physical phenomena encountered in the engine environment.\n\nAchievement of this project aim will be accomplished via two major technical objectives: 1) successful completion of an experimental testing campaign involving materials characterisation, bespoke friction and aerodynamic testing; 2) Development of a multi-physics model capable of describing the thermal physics, mechanical physics and fluid dynamics which are the three key physical domains involved in a high-temperature engine valve environment.

Fouling shortens the plant life, increases the need for periodic cleaning and pipe replacement. It also causes contamination of the end products which is especially serious when the fouling involves bacterial biofilms and the products are intended for direct human consumption. In addition pipe blockages, deformation, rupture or corrosion cause by a build up of fouling can lead to major incidents such as explosions involving with threats to human life and plant destruction involving loss of product and jobs.

The extreme pressures produce hoop stresses in a pipe causing the pipe welds to creep continuously in time until weld creep cracks are generated which, if undiscovered, may grow until the pipe ruptures. The pipes also suffer continuous cyclic loading through vibrations which produces fatigue cracks in the welds which if undetected are another cause of pipe rupture.

Although airframes make a significant contribution, most of the balance (especially NOx) will be contributed by the engines.

Augmenting performance can be achieved by introducing new active controls to reduce off-design component efficiency loss, improve surge margin and lean blow out margin.  Unfortunately, current implementations are limited by the characteristics of existing electromechanical and hydraulic actuation devices (i.e. frequency response and cyclic life) and the high temperature, pressure and possibly liquid wetted operating conditions.

As a result, OEM manufacturers are moving to aluminium based solutions to reduce vehicle weight, improve fuel economy and overall sustainability of the vehicle. OEMs are increasingly out-sourcing their innovation activities and are actively seeking cost-effective lightweight braking solutions from Tier 1 suppliers. A substantial amount of vehicle weight resides in conventional cast-iron brake discs. Brakes form part of the \u201cunsprung mass\u201d (UM) of the vehicle, i.e. not supported by the suspension. The impact of UM weight on fuel consumption is compounded by the effects of rotational inertia and therefore has a much greater effect on fuel consumption per kg than non-moving parts. \n\nAdopting aluminium brake discs would reduce weight considerably and deliver fuel savings, or greater range in the case of electric vehicles. Furthermore, reducing rotational inertia through lighter discs, leads to better drive-handling, improved acceleration, and shorter braking distances. However, the use of aluminium in a cost-effective brake disc solution has failed due to excessive wear of the material.

The water in the system pipes is stagnant and, if inhibitors are inactive, then this can give rise to microbiological induced corrosion (MIC), which leads to leaks. This corrosion is localised and is not evident in close visual inspection until the leak starts. Moreover the pipes are often enclosed and difficult to access for close viewing. MIC may occur in both dry and wet sprinkler systems.\nLong range ultrasonic testing (LRUT) has been developed for screening long lengths of pipe (up to 100m from one test location) for corrosion, especially in otherwise inaccessible areas.
