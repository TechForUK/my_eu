The cooperation with other EU institutions has made the educational community to overcome the several barriers imposed by its peripheral location, helping in this way to avoid problems such as school dropout and youth unemployment. In this way, the making of a sense of European citizenship, through a constant flow of teachers and students from other partner institutions, and the promotion of foreign languages learning and teaching, have been some of the main priorities in the philosophy of IES A Sangri\u00f1a.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the present project has a main purpose, the observation of new methodologies in the teaching of foreign languages, both being understood as pure subjects and through the CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning).  In our case, a teacher will be sent to a French school in order to follow-up the teaching of the Spanish language as a foreign language. And two of our teachers will be sent to two different British schools to deepen and observe the teaching methodology of their subjects being taught in English (in this case Physical Education and History). At the same time, the contact with other schools will provide participants with new perspectives and initiatives for European cooperation, mainly in the framework of Erasmus+ program.\r\n\r\nAll the participants are active members of the international team of IES A Sangri\u00f1a, and for this reason, they have a remarkable and wide background to tackle a project like this: an active and tolerant European consciousness and, above all, the certainty that the teacher training is essential to provide our students with a comprehensive education and future prospects.\r\n\r\nThe activities that will be carried out in their host schools are observation and direct participation in teaching activities, both as complementary and extracurricular teaching. Further meetings are planned with the teacher staff, educational authorities, parents associations and other institutions in the area with a different educational offer. The methodology of this project will be immersion in the life of the host school, so participants could feel another member of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe expected results are acquiring new perspectives, methodologies and teaching approaches, improving communication skills (linguistic and social) and the opening of new avenues of European cooperation. This will have an impact at all levels: individual, because that will improve the skills of teachers and acquire new tools; local, both in the host school -by feedback-, and in the sending school \u2013where students will benefit from the professional improvement of teachers involved-; and, more generally, an impact on the educational community of both countries because of the results of this experience will benefit future participants.\r\n\r\nThe long-term benefits will derive from the above mentioned impact: foreign language training is the best way to fight against the low level that Spain has always had in this area, and only this way of improving the skills of our teachers can overcome the present situation.", "http://www.rlc.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-002584_1"], ["7AB", "Towards Improved language Production Through Ongoing Pedagogic training  \r\nTIP TOP", "Richard Language College Limited", 222066.0, "In spite of initiatives to foster the communicative approach of ELT in Austrian schools, ELT at primary schools has not really met the goals defined in the Austrian curriculum and in CEFR. On the whole, performances on secondary lower level are much better which is proved in the test results of national standards E8 from 2014. Unfortunately only a small number of schools received raters to find out about pupils' oral communications skills. Speaking in a language class does still not have the importance it should have. In inclusive settings every child  can contribute to language learning providing knowledge and skills in their mother tongue.\r\nCLIL is an option to introduce more English in schools without rising the number of English lessons per week. Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics. Teachers also have to prepare pupils to make use of digital ways to learn and improve a language. As a consequence e-education must be part of teacher training as well.\r\nOur project goals:\r\nFostering the knowledge of modern languages and intercultural communication\r\nTeaching staff that keeps improving their own competence in modern languages to act as role models for students\r\nIncrease of ICT in language classes\r\nIncrease of CLIL in primary and lower secondary schools\r\nIncreased use of the potential of collaboration within Europe\r\nFurther development of ICT competences as a basic prerequisite for innovation and collaboration in the field of education\r\nReinforcement of motivation and contentment of teaching staff\r\nIncreasing the number of joint projects in the province of Styria (School to school partnerships, eTwinning, A-Twinning)\r\nInitiatives to set up regional and European networks of teachers\r\nSetting up an online communication helpdesk for pupils operated by native speakers \r\nRaising awareness for the importance of language learning on all levels (teachers, inspectors, school authorities)\r\nExpanding of invitations to informal \"tea time chats\" for all teachers run by native speakers \r\nThe participants in job shadowing are headteachers and teachers who have been using innovative ways of teaching already and who are willing to share their experience with other colleagues within Europe. In addition school inspectors who have to guide schools with their school development as well as education psychologists who contribute their knowledge of learning styles to the implementation of successful inclusive learning environements take part in job shadowing and exchange meetings.\r\nAs far as job shadowing is concerned teachers usually have only limited knowledge of how other teachers of English act in their classes. Observing classes has become more frequent on secondary level, but is still the exception in primary schools for reasons as tight timetabling and English considered a low priority subject. Teachers need time to watch the students' learning process with both struggling and success. Teachers will volunteer to job shadowing and will indicate their interest to the Landesschulrat via their headteachers.\r\nTeachers who want to do intensive training in a course in Ireland or Scotland will come up with a selected course from the Erasmus+ SEG course catalogue. Teachers who choose courses that are in line with the school profile will get priority. Only schools with a school development plan that contains \"Improvement of language competence\" will be nominated. All participants must be willing to share their experience with other colleagues not taking part in the programme. They are to act as disseminators.\r\nThe strong impact of the consortium will help the region and the province to make faster progress aiming at the targets of Europe 2020. \r\nAbove all the project will serve the pupils: better learning performances achieved with the help of innovative and motivated teachers will improve the students career opportunities and will in the end strengthen the economy and as a consequence the province of Styria. Strong regions form the backbone of Europe.\r\nThe consortium consists of 1.300 compulsory school teachers plus  members of the school authority , teaching or being responsible for 7447 students. Out of this 1300 educational professionals 179 will do an European job-shadowing, 76 are intending to do a teacher training course, this means that around 19% of the staff members of the consortium will go for a mobility.

This changes the role and task assignments at all levels. School inspectors, as \"regional education managers\", should contribute more to a regional education planning. Autonomy requires new leadership skills from the head teachers. The mobility project is to be supported by internationalization, European opening and cooperation in the implementation of these objectives. Schools are given the opportunity to accentuate their own priorities. Due to international cooperation, the project participants can get to know successful models and take them into consideration for their work or school development. Training courses and conferences will give them new impetus and input on innovative methods. In order to promote international co-operation, it is important to develop further the knowledge as well as the competences of the participating educational staff by means of courses. Job shadowing is intended to help develop new learning and teaching methods, personnel development, quality assurance, new management and management processes and structures.\r\nThe project aims to strengthen the international network of both the participating schools as well as the authorities and institutions, the introduction of new measures in school development and improved professional competences, which will ultimately support the development and achievements of our pupils.", "http://www.rlc.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-AT01-KA101-034958_27"], ["7AB", "GEMS ( Goal-based Educational Movement to Success)", "Richard Language College Limited", 42488.0, "The rational of the GEMS ( Goal-based Educational Movement to Success) comes from the utter need to combat the dramatically increasing the students absence and modernize and internationalize our institution.

Most of them are dysfunctional families suffering from unemployment or having little professional qualification, which mean serious economic and social deficits. Many of the students who start their studies in our school end up leaving the educational system, and that is why we are involved in a compensatory education programme.\r\nThe school intends to contribute to the fulfillment of the objectives given by the 2020 European Strategy, which includes the objective to reduce early school leaving to a level below 10%. We would like our teachers to improve and update their teaching methods and approaches so as to foster motivation in students to finish their secondary education, as well as to get to know new learning standards and 21st century teaching skills, analysing good practice on this specific issue in some countries with prestigious national education systems.\r\nOn the other side, since the school year 2016-2017, Sierra de Aras secondary school takes part in the Multilingualism Plan, being a English bilingual school. Another action plan, promoted by this fact, is our teachers training, especially those teachers who are teaching bilingual subjects, on CLIL methodologies.\r\nFurthermore, the development of this project is intended to provide our school with well qualified staff, which allows us to keep working in the development of our internationalisation plan and its European level. This is the main reason why carrying out job shadowing and training courses on CLIL methodologies in other European countries will be crucial in order to go through intercultural and international learning experiences, as a previous stage to implement future KA2 actions (Cooperation Strategies Association) and to make contacts who may become future partners.\r\nTeachers of different subjects are involved in this project to take training courses and carry out mobilities abroad, where we could learn new and innovative methodologies which can be carried out in our future lessons as well as explained and analysed through Work Groups. These teachers will be chosen in accordance with objective criteria (working time at our school, curriculum, personal interview, foreign languages skills) which allow us to succeed in the project.

It also allows them to apply their technical knowledge gained from their studies and acquire new knowledge and skills which will provide them with a wider and international vision. They will also gain traversable skills, develop aptitudes and personal competencies such as adaptability, innovation, entrepreneurship, personal and professional skills. This will be thanks to the cultural differences obtained from living in another country and in a different social and economic environment in addition to having to problem solve on a daily basis. They will also improve their English skills which will allow them to have a quick and efficient incorporation into the labour market.\r\nWith respect to our teachers, the possibility of participating in a placement project in the form of job shadowing will contribute equally to increase their motivation as well as improve the quality of their teaching. This will be translated into an improvement in the quality of teaching offered at the centre. On the other hand, the collaborations established in the development of the project and through the placement will allow the generation of communication networks at a regional and international level facilitating future projects and collaborations in this and in other areas.\r\nEach centre has a placement delegate that coordinates with the other centres and the coordinator of the consortium to guarantee the optimum development and operation of the project. Meetings will be held by different people from the placement project from the start to create a communication network and distribute organisation, management, tracking and campaigning responsibilities.\r\nThe consortium also counts on intermediary partners based in the Region of Murcia and in the UK (Bournemouth) which will help with the practical aspects of the programme (searching for residencies, pedagogical, cultural and language training, support upon arrival at the destination country, personalised tracking of the students etc.)\r\nThe information from the VET-EMPLOY (Higher Level Vocational Education and Training Programmes) has been made available for all students and vocational education teaching staff as well as for other groups in the centres. The process of selection will be conducted clearly and transparently.  Once students are awarded a placement, several tutors will be made available to them who will ensure their optimum development and create a fluid and constant personalised level of communication.\r\nEach centre will promote the project from the moment that they created the consortium until its completion. This will be on a local and a regional level (using the internet, social networks, press and or the radio).\r\nUpon completion of the placement, the students will receive a series of documents confirming their experience such as the Europass Certificate and the Internship Certificate which can be attached to their CV demonstrating the capacities acquired as well as actual jobs completed to increase their chances of incorporation into the labour market. The consortium will evaluate the results of the project, the campaign and complete a self evaluation that will allow the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the project with the overall aim of improving future exchanges and collaborations.
