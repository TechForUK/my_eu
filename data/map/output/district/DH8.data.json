By its very nature, the surface of a filter is an open structure in which microorganisms can readily settle. Nutrients available in the in-feed enable these to grow. As a result biofilms develop leading to an overall reduction of filtration efficiency of 30-50%, unstable processes and frequent filter change. A multitude of strategies are tried to reduce membrane fouling which in itself demonstrates the urgency of the problem. Current strategies, often used in combination, are: enhanced modules and membranes, cross-flow filtration, low flux, regular back flush, permeate stoppage, scouring, sparging, rinsing cycles, chemical cleaning with soda, caustic or tenside solutions. ConductMem will develop an advanced system that can permanently prevent biofilm formation and surface fouling by the electrolytic production of biocidal oxidising agents on the membrane surface itself. The conductive membrane operates as an anode. The current flow will generate OH-radicals, Ozone and Hydrogen Peroxide on the membrane surface. These oxidizing agents degrade organic matter and disinfect the surface. The technology will be demonstrated by an automated non-fouling membrane filtration unit fitted into the partner\u2019s membrane bioreactor design, incurring an additional cost of less than 15% compared with the state of the art - but with membranes that will last twice as long and not require chemical cleaning. It is expected that the MBR market will grow strongly as environmental directives, aimed at improving the quality of European water, are implemented. And domestic sewage will not be the only waste stream that can benefit from our apparatus. Other industries such as food production, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals will also be convinced by the financial and environmental benefits of treating their waste streams using ConductMem technology.", 170851.0, 1278517.0, "ConductMem", null, null, null, null, "http://www.microbac.co.uk", null, "fp7_100444_996819337"], ["7ND", "Bottom-up fabrication of nano carbon-inorganic hybrid materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production", "Thomas Swan & Co Limited", "CARINHYPH projects deals with the hierarchical assembly of functional nanomaterials into novel nanocarbon-inorganic hybrid structures for energy generation by photocatalyic hydrogen production, with Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) and graphene the choice of nanocarbons.

The steel demand in Europe in 2011 was estimated to be 145M tons, of which 39M tons p.a. for the construction sector and 16M tons p.a. for structural steel. Most of this steel is carbon or mild steel (as opposed to stainless steel) which corrodes at a high rate and although there are a significant number of anticorrosion solutions on the market, protective coating is most widely used, thanks to its low cost and high versatility. Often, an anticorrosion primer is applied just after manufacturing of steel in order to prevent rusting during storage and transportation before fabrication (cut,weld,drill,etc). Most anticorrosion primers last max 6 month due to poor quality or mechanical damage resulting in corrosion. Additionally, these anticorrosion primers are often too thick (~50\u03bcm) preventing weld quality, so time consuming localised grinding is done to remove the primer. If the primer is thin enough (~25\u03bcm) to allow welding, its anticorrosion properties are so limited, not reducing the risk of corrosion. Above all, the increased zinc content in the weldable primer formulation in order to achieve the anti-corrosion property result in health hazards and discomfort during fabrication process as it releases significant amount of zinc fumes. Alternatively, primers are simply not used at all but the expensive and hazardous blast cleaning of steel is carried out before fabrication which may sometimes be too late that it results in huge material waste and cost. The problem to be solved is the inability of the weldable primer produced today to allow both good quality welding and durable corrosion protection without health hazards.\nThe WeldaPrime project proposes an innovative approach for a zinc free corrosion protection primer with an optimum thickness and affordable cost, offering durable corrosion protection, resistant to mechanical damage and weldable without zinc fumes.", 36107.0, 2124821.0, "WELDAPRIME", null, null, null, "http://weldaprime.com/", "http://www.thomas-swan.co.uk", null, "fp7_111373_984372103"], ["7ND", "High Performance Insulation based on Nanostructure encapsulation of air", "Thomas Swan & Co Limited", "The concept of High Performance Insulation Based on Nanostructured Encapsulation of Air (HIPIN), described in this proposal, is to develop a sustainable and affordable technology to produce a nanostructured thermal insulating coating to improve thermal efficiency in new and retrofitting buildings.

Bacteria in hospitals present a major health issue.The effectiveness of cleaning is considerably enhanced on smooth, scratch-free surfaces.Anti-bacterial silver coatings are available; however they are not used in hospitals due to cost, effectiveness and durability.Copper offers a low cost, effective and environmentally friendly solution that could be readily adopted. The challenge is to retain copper nano-particles in a structure that provides antibacterial functionality, but prevents leaching.The CuVito consortium believes that the silsesquioxane structure, formed using Vitolane technology is the answer.\nSilsesquioxanes have the formula RSiO1.5 (where R is an organic ligand), and form cage or ladder structures.They confer hardness and abrasion resistance to coatings and, by selecting appropriate R groups (e.g. acrylate, glycidoxy) can chemically bond to the organic resin in the formulation controlling cross-link density to enhance durability.Hence silsesquioxanes are inherently suited to use in coatings for surfaces which require regular cleaning.Silsesquioxanes have been available for some years but at a prohibitively high cost, due to the complexity of manufacture.Vitolane technology is an alternative, cost effective production route which has been patented and is currently being scaled up commercially.It has a unique processing feature in allowing simple selection of R groups and it is proposed to use this to bond directly to the copper nanoparticles, resolving the issue of leaching.The objectives of the project of the project are:\n1.Develop a copper nano-particle production process\n2.Functionalise silsesquioxanes with copper using Vitolane technology\n3.Produce a commercially acceptable coating\n4.Validate coating in a hospital environment", 61314.0, 1685792.0, "CUVITO", "Nano-structured antimicrobial materials", "Antimicrobial coatings for the medical and food industries are an important deterrent to development of significant health hazards.

Copper NP antimicrobial coatings were created from bases of polyurethane, epoxy, acrylic and polyester. Coatings were applied on aluminium and stainless steel.\n\nAntimicrobial testing in the presence of common hospital microbes demonstrated that the copper-containing fibres developed by CUVITO were equivalent or superior to silver-containing fibres. Work is ongoing to test the fibres in a medical environment.\n\nIn summary, thanks to a close and fruitful collaboration, the consortium has developed a cost-effective method for manufacturing copper NPs exploiting a silsesquioxane structure formed using Vitolane technology. Partners are currently scaling up production to batch level. In the meantime, results have led to six patent applications, three in Mexico and three in Europe, and numerous products being prepared for commercial exploitation.\n\nCUVITO technology will provide a cost-effective and non-toxic alternative to silver antimicrobial coatings for health care and food applications.

Consequently, the participation to the Erasmus+ project is even more effective in helping the school comply with the new requirements and offering the trainees an invaluable experience that might even steer the beneficiary towards specific future working/training choices. \r\nAlthough the work placement is an important stage of the process of personal growth for the participants, a good project does not confine itself to the period of work experience abroad, but preliminarily it offers preparatory activities at school that cover the whole span of the project\u2019s life. \r\nA qualifying feature of the experience is the planning and testing, rich in content and quality, of the Learning Outcomes Units inspired by the ECVET system and of the agreed upon learning objectives with tools such as the MoU and the LA, both with the traditional partners of the CREDCHEM network and with the ones of the educational and tourist fields, with the purpose of acquiring skills that can be transferred to national and international contexts. \r\nIn order to promote this good practice that can be applied in particular in the context of the Technical school of Chemistry, this year more mobilities will be reserved for the students of the Chemistry branch, consistently with the Key Objectives of ET2020 to make science and technology more appealing while improving one\u2019s language skills, strengthening creativity and innovation as key factors of a sustainable economic development. \r\nHigh quality skills and competences for employability, innovation, active citizenship and welfare, together with transparency and competence and qualification recognition, are explicitly recommended among the 6 priorities of the 2016-2020 period.  \r\nThis important goal is reached thanks to work-based learning provided by the work placements, which have the following objectives: \r\n\u2022 For the Chemistry Technical School: acquiring methodologies and procedures in the field of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental hygiene and healthcare analysis; interpreting results and writing reports; using instruments; performing qualitative/quantitative analysis with different methodologies;\r\n\u2022 For the Foreign Languages School: developing multilingual communicative skills in the tourist and cultural fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, recreation/cultural centres, universities, museums; collaborating in the organization of events, planning itineraries, managing reservations and quotes; collaborating in an educational team by planning activities relevant to the interests of the participants using one\u2019s communicative skills. \r\nThis project supports the teachers involved as tutors in a process of continuous professional development through projects of teacher mobility (ERASMUS+ CLIL O.W.Ne.R.S. 2016-1-IT02-KA101-022762); this opportunity will be taken this year by some of the tutors that have most recently joined the Erasmus+ team, to improve their teaching competence and language skills as teachers of non-language-related subjects.", "http://www.dets.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005740_11"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DH8"}
