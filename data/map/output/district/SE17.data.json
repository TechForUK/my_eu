The majority of its 400+  pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds  with English as an additional language.   \r\n\r\nSince 2014 when Ofsted inspected the school and awarded us the rating of 'Requires Improvement', our staff and parents and pupils have worked hard to improve every aspect of our school.  In 2016 when we were inspected again, we were judged to be 'Good' in all categories.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Ofsted noted 2 areas where we still need to improve. One was in our teaching of French.  And the other was in the general consistency and creativity of our teaching to ensure continuous outstanding learning by our pupils.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this application is to obtain the funding that we need to address these needs identified by the Ofsted Inspectors.  \r\n\r\nAs part of our School Improvement Plan, we intend to send 6  key staff from our all of our Key Stage 2 year groups (Years 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6)  to France for one week immersion training in both 2018 and 2019.  The provider is a long standing French Language Training Centre in Antibes that has provided training for staff from other schools in our borough over many years with good results.  We believe their courses, which include pure language and teaching methodology training, as well as contact with local French teachers and cultural immersion, will raise the confidence and capability of our teaching team to deliver French much better.  \r\n\r\nSecondly, over the 2 year period of this project, we want to send 6 Key Learning Leaders from our staff to courses in each of the Algarve, Portugal and Jarfalla, Sweden to experience a different education context and to compare and contrast how we deliver our teaching.  We believe this will give us new ideas and the chance to think analytically about our own teaching practice in a way that can be disseminated throughout our staff and lead to ongoing improvement.  Our borough has links with both these regions, having coordinated 2 year Comenius Regio projects with both areas previously.  Although  we were not part of those projects, the 2 partners abroad that would deliver our training were -- a Teacher In-service Centre in Lagos, Portugal and the Local Authority in Jarfalla, Sweden.  So we know they are able to teach us new approaches.  \r\n\r\nOur key language teaching staff at Key Stage 2 will be involved in the first training type.   Our Senior Leadership and Learning Leaders will take part in the second.   All learning outcomes will be recorded and then analyzed and disseminated throughout our school, with the aim being that Ofsted notes significant improvement in our teaching performance at their next inspection.  \r\n\r\nWe expect significant personal and professional development to result for our staff and our teaching to improve as a result of these training activities.      We also think that our school needs these experiences to improve our international links and our connections to the wider world.  It will boost our European dimension which has not been as strong as it could be in the past and which will bring new ideas and understanding of our place in the world and the way we teach and learn to both our staff and pupils.", "http://www.englishmartyrsrcprimary.co.uk", "ENGLISH MARTYRS' CATHOLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035566_coordinator"]]}}, "2JY": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "School European Professional Development", "Surrey Square Primary School", 15871.0, 1, 1, "Surrey Square Primary School is a two-form entry maintained school in the central London Borough of Southwark. We currently provide weekly French teaching by class teachers to all children from the ages of 7 to 11 (Key Stage 2). In 2015 we applied for, and received, funding to provide overseas residential French training for up to 9 teaching staff in order to improve their subject knowledge and confidence in teaching French lessons. This residential course is due to take place during May 2016.In order to further consolidate French teaching at the school,  to introduce Spanish as a second MFL option and potentially to introduce MFL teaching across the Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1, we would like to apply for funding to send more staff on residential courses in both France and Spain over the course of the next two years. Prior to July 2018, we would like to send: - a group of 5 class teachers and Higher Level Teaching Assistants (HLTAs) from Key Stage 2 to undertake a residential course in France; and - a group of 4 class teachers and HLTAs from Key Stage 2 and a member of our reception staff to undertake a residential course in Spain. There may be some overlap between the two groups.These courses will enable teachers to improve and/or refresh their existing subject knowledge, immerse them in the language and culture of France or Spain (as applicable), provide teaching ideas and examples of teaching in the native country and will boost the confidence of individuals in a subject area in which many primary practitioners are non-specialists.Within the school, there is already a small number of French and Spanish-speaking staff (of varying levels of proficiency) who we would like to form a core team of MFL specialists at the school and who would lead these trips. Given that providers of such residential courses differentiate their training according to ability, such staff members would take part in higher-ability training whereas other staff without an MFL background would take part in beginners' courses. Our goal is to ensure that, as a minimum, teachers across Key Stage 2 (and ideally across the school as a whole) will feel confident in meeting the primary MFL curriculum. We believe that the increased teacher confidence and subject knowledge that these courses provide will help teachers and HLTAs to immerse children in languages in the classroom, provide fun, interactive lessons to engage children, improve pronunciation, and help children to diminish any barriers to learning by showing their own self-confidence in speaking in another language. In order to maintain the impact of the project the school language specialists will be able to provide ongoing continuing professional development (including in-school training sessions, auditing and updating resources and planning) and day-to-day support for non-specialists. In addition, we believe that training our reception staff in Spanish will significantly benefit the families of the many Spanish-speaking students at the school whose numbers have been increasing over recent years.We will closely monitor both the short and long-term impact this project will have on language learning at Surrey Square. This will be done in a number of ways including via regular half-termly ongoing subject leadership monitoring to verify that MFL curriculum targets are being met and via  staff and pupil questionnaires (both pre- and post- training) to capture staff confidence and pupil responses to MFL teaching.As Surrey Square is a teacher training institution, we will seek to use our core specialist language team as role models and ambassadors for other schools in the area with whom we have a relationship and who are seeking to improve their MFL provision. We will also be able to provide specialist MFL teacher training to those students and NQTs who conduct their training within Surrey Square.As a multi-national, multi-faith school, children and adults at Surrey Square see themselves as global citizens and this project will undoubtedly help them to consolidate their understanding of the world around them through an understanding of other languages and cultures.", "http://www.surreysquareprimary.co.uk", "Surrey Square Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023923_coordinator"], [2015, "Surrey Square Language Project", "Surrey Square Primary School", 5276.0, 1, 1, "Our proposed project would target French language competency in Key Stage 2 teachers at Surrey Square Primary School, following the new statutory status of MFL in primary schools.

The estate is the largest in the country and the school serves the 'global majority', since 90% of pupils are from non-white British heritages. French is taught by 8 class teachers in Key Stage 2, supported by a specialist French subject leader. These teachers are not linguists and confidence to deliver the language provision varies greatly between individuals. As a school, the objective is to raise the confidence, proficiency and enthusiam of all our staff to a good level. We aim to achieve this by sending all 8 teachers and the subject coordinator on a language course together within the coming year. For this year-long project, these teachers (including NQTs, experienced teachers and the MFL leader) would participate in a week-long residential French course at the Centre International d'Antibes. This course is accredited by Eaquals and other organisations; it is already accessed by other schools in the borough. The content includes pure language learning, teaching methodology and contact with local schools. \r\n\r\nBefore embarking on the project, we would collect opinions on language teaching and learning from both staff and pupils in Key Stage 2 in the form of a staff subject audit and pupil questionnaire. During the term following the return of the course participants, this process would be repeated in order to measure the impact of the project. Predicted results are: increased basic spoken French language and grammar ability; a new enthusiasm and passion for the subject as a whole key stage, thereby raising the profile of MFL amongst both staff and children; links established with schools and organisations in Europe, enriching the experiences of the children at our school and beyond. As well as impacting the school itself, the project would also reach parents and the wider local community.

Political participation in this context includes both, the involvement in primary power structures such as local parliaments ( city council meetings / advisory boards ... ) as well as the involvement in extra-parliamentary bodies and initiatives ( youth organizations, citizens' movements ... ) . The main activity  of the  project, which starts on 01/09/2015,  is a seminar which takes place from 15 till 22/11/2015 . The participants should exchange experiences, present and evalutate the concepts of their different best practices from their every day political participation in local power structures.  Furthermore we want to improve the strategies of the political youth participation. We will invite experts who can give advices to the participants, how to develop and improve political action strategies for young people who wants to change society. During the follow up ( till 31/01/2016) the partner organisations of the project are meant to transfer the outcome of the training to the members of their organisations, to the regional movements and to national organisations/bodies. The  aim of the activity is to support youth sucessful in the field of youth participation in political structures. \r\nAs a result of the training, participants will promote effective, youth in political participation, including through acquired skills such as improved understanding of the political intentions of young people , expand knowledge of forms and instruments of a self-determined political youth participation , etc., and developed potentials ( e.g. with the project resulting international networks in the field of youth political participation and the techniques developed by the project activity opportunities for young people in the area of political participation) .\r\nLocation of the training is the  Education Center Kurt L\u00f6wenstein near Berlin (DE ) .", "http://www.woodcraft.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-DE04-KA105-012213_2"], [2014, "\"Changeover: Generations in the Field of Youth Work\"", "Woodcraft Folk", 13454.0, 7, 7, "To Esplais Catalans, - an non-profit organization of people and 107 youth organizations (esplais) working  for social transformation through the volunterring and education in childrens rights-, it is very important that teenagers form 13 years old continue participating actively in their organizations.

Around 3000 children and young people aged 6-25 will participate in the international camp, coming from around 50 countries worldwide. They are all members of the network of our umbrella organisation IFM-SEI. During the camp, the children and young people will build \"another world\" together, where they democratically take decisions, learn together, contribute to an exciting camp programme and think about how they can build a world based on democracy, solidarity, equality and friendship in their own communities after the camp. The camp is also an important space for our network of sister organisations to share the results of our educational work of the last years, learn from each other and forge new partnerships.During the first four days of the service, the volunteers will receive training on intercultural learning and nonformal education, and will then develop educational activities. They can choose if they would like to offer outdoor activies such as hikes, games for big groups, sports tournaments etc, or organise workshops on one of the thematic areas of the camp:- Peace- Equality- Anti-racism- Democracy and Participation- Cooperation- Gender equality - LGBT*IQ- Mediation  - Peer education and young leaders training During the two weeks of the camp, the volunteer group will meet regularly to finalise the preparations of their activities, support each other in implementing the activities, and to give feedback to each other so that the volunteers can learn from the experience. Two external trainers as well as one person from SJD Die Falken will support the volunteers throughout the whole time.
