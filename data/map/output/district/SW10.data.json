Main target group are both youth workers and their trainers. Education and training for both will be developed to acquire competence and make use of up to date digital technology. This will enable professional youth work to become a player in the digitalisation of Europe increasing digital inclusion, community cohesion, digital citizenship, youth participation, while decreasing informational poverty among young people.YOWOMO2.0-Train builds on the results of the European research projects \u201cEU Kids Online\u201d and \u201cNet Children Go Mobile\u201d. Their results indicate that both the training of youth workers and their professional practice are challenged by the growing significance of smartphones and social media in young people\u2019s lives. Internet use is increasingly mobile with more children accessing the internet in the privacy of their bedroom and when out and about. Although children do more online, most do still not climb far up \u201cthe ladder of opportunities\u201d. The knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for professional youth work facing these challenges are described in the Youth Work Mobile 2.0 (YOWOMO2.0) competence framework, which is the outcome of a former European partnership. Building on this framework YOWOMO2.0-Train will now be the first project to be sustainable and to implement the YOWOMO2.0-competences for youth work in the age of smartphones and social media in youth work education and training. Representing the diversity of both practice and training of youth workers in Europe this will be done by applying the competence framework suitable in Higher Education, in Vocational Education and Training, and in Continuing Vocational Education and Training in various European contexts. Due to the diversity the recognition and accreditation of education and training will refer to established systems such ECTS and ECVET, but also will refer to link to non-formal/informal tools such as for example \u201cThe Council of Europe Youth Work Portfolio\".YOWOMO2.0-Train is partly building on the results of the former YOWOMO2.0 partnership there are partners from the former YOWOMO2.0 involved. However, also new partners are included to allow for new insights and diversity related to culture, social system and level of digitalisation.YOWOMO2.0-Train will develop and pilot three outputs:(1) A course for youth work in the age of smartphones and social media. This course will enable youth work trainees and professionals to acquire the competences for youth work in the age of smartphones and social media. Due to the diversity of both youth work practice and youth work education and training across Europe the instructional design of this course will reflect the contexts of the participating partners. This will be achieved by developing adaptations for on the one hand (1) trainees and students Higher Education, Vocational Education and Training), and on the other hand professionals after entry into working life (Continuing Vocational Education and Training) as (2) in-house training and (3) external course.(2) A preparatory course for trainers, educators, and lecturers to hold the courses for youth work in the age of smartphones and social media(3) An online learning platform and repository. The YOWOMO2.0-Train online platform will offer these courses in form of MOOCs and will serve as a repository of open educational resources for education and training.More than 4000 persons will benefit from the project being involved in stakeholder interviews, focus groups, pilots, multiplier events, or as users of the online platform. The project will impact local, regional, national and international stakeholders in seven countries (Germany, UK, Turkey, Romania, Poland, Italy, The Netherlands) stimulating improvements in youth work practice and in the education and training of youth workers by offering up-to-date education and training on different qualification levels (HE, VET, CVET).", "http://www.proartandco.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA202-003464_8"], ["0SZ", "Hands On Plastic Environment", "Pro Art & Co", 49472.0, "Plastic in environment is an important and popular topic throughout the world and environmentalists and ecologists talk about this issue through different media securing wider access to inform public about its impact on natural environment, urban and rural areas and about  the measures to apply in order to protect these habitats. In the last century, plastic materials made revolutionary changes in industry, medicine, food and communication, and today, our life could not be imagined without plastic. This is especially important in urban and some rural areas, where food industry, energy and production of reusable and non-reusable containers, plastic packaging, bags and items from everyday use could not be the same in different wrapping. Plastic influence on the environment is huge and European Centre for Plastic in the Environment regularly issues guidelines to the manufacturers to achieve the balance between commercial demands and environmental impact which includes additional services, like recycling and the market for recycled products, labelling, collection and waste management and a compliance with EU legislation. Partnership, formed by 6 EU countries (UK, Slovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey), shares interest and experience in participating, creating and implementing project for benefit of local national and wider European participants and public users. All partners worked already in similar projects. The knowledge and attitude towards plastic origin and influence must be the norm of life today and this project aims to reach out in partner\u2019s country\u2019s population, and to inform people of any age, level of education or social, economic and ethnic background about the use and misuses of plastic also the benefits of recycling related to health, economy and active citizens impact on social behaviour. This is the idea which led us to propose this project which concerns majority of people in Europe and will tackles the problem in an innovative way through digital, mobile devices, VR presentation, exhibitions and public talks about the \"journey\" of plastic from its source material to its use and disposal or recycling which would produce the energy or will be transformed into a new plastic form.  \r\n\r\nThe project\u2019s aim is to provide the new learning initiatives for staff and target group participants: educators, young people, diverse stakeholders and public in local partner countries. The project's goal is to develop and share different working practices between the partners\u2019 organisations and to transfer the innovative pedagogical and training experiences in order to provide diverse skills and increased confidence in delivering this kind of work.  We plan to achieve that through events, wide-range of digital communication, transnational meetings where the exchange of experiences, good practices and the information about the local environmental education will be the base of cooperation and joint activities. \r\n\r\nDiverse approach to environment will allow some innovative practices to be integrated in local partner\u2019s activities and would bring more awareness to local service users, advancement in training of the partners' staff,  and to deliver the tangible outcomes: e-handbook, Blog, digital video VR/3D presentations,  use of social media, exhibitions which will include talks about these topics and workshops for staff, stakeholders and public, to introduce the facts related to plastic junk disposed in natural and urban/rural environment and how to reduce irresponsible and harmful impact on people and promote acceptable behaviour. Environmental hazards are part of this presentation but we also aim to include exhibitions, fact files with photographic material  related to plastic \u201cjourney\u201d from its source to its end, with more conceptual way of tackling the problem, which especially suites young people. \r\n\r\nThe major beneficiaries will be the partner\u2019s organisations' which will improve working practices, increase staff\u2019s competence and implement new knowledge, pedagogical practice and experience in their regular work and expand the network of collaborators, but also gain much wider network of key stakeholders, professionals and public participants.  The benefit of working with partners from the different countries is in diversity of approaches to this topic and different practices which are implemented in partners\u2019 organisations works, which support intercultural and structured dialogue, which is an added value to the project. It also promotes multilingual opportunities and possibility of translation increasing partner's engagement and before their international meetings, it will improve communication and support visits, which provides more opportunities for dissemination and better exchange of knowledge and skills.
