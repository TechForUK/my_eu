With this recent funding cuts there has been a growing concern that many school children are simply not getting enough exercise, with some education authorities citing this as a risk factor to an obesity epidemic if this continues.  Schools in Germany have a lower level of childhood obesity than schools in England, this project will enable the schools to share best practise on how they encourage sport in and out of school.\r\n\r\nBoth schools are of a similar size with just over 300 children in each and with children of the same age-range.  This is an excellent opportunity to encourage sport and learning new sports from each school and introducing these into the PE curriculums in both schools.  The sports days in both schools could be studied and it is hoped that at the end of the project there could be an element of the sports day that could be shared across both countries, for example with a typical German sport to be part of the sports day competition in England and the same happening in Germany.\r\n\r\nChildren from Years five and six will be offered the chance to travel to Germany and England to research the sports in both schools.  However through joint assemblies in both schools all children will have access to the project.  Both schools will design a logo for the project (all children can enter).  All year groups will chose a sport to showcase to the partner schools, all year groups will skype and take part in sport questionnaire to collect data to disseminate about the project.  As much as possible all children in both schools will take part and be aware of the project.  It is hoped that we can plan visits around the schools sports days and we can introduce a German sport into our English sports day and an English sport into the German sports day.  Representatives (children and staff) will attend sports days in both countries.\r\n\r\nEach Year Group will take part to design the project logo.  Year Groups will actively showcase one sport and demonstrate this to the partner school during the visits.  Each Year Group will skype their associate year group in the partner school and take part in pupil questionnaires.  We want the whole school to be involved.  We will also disseminate these new sports to our 15 partner schools who are linked to us as we are an Expert Centre for Global Learning through the Global Learning Programme. We would also be keen to share our sports findings with our four senior feeder schools.\r\n\r\nThe expected results would be -\r\n\r\nA wider sports curriculum in both schools.\r\nA healthy lifestyle for all pupils.\r\nA chance for children to practise their English and German language skills.\r\nA chance for disadvantaged children to travel abroad for the first time.\r\nExcellent relationships between partner schools.\r\nIncreased motivation for language learning.\r\nincreased quality of education in the field of sport and language learning at Primary level.\r\n\r\nOur local target audience with the children in both primary schools.  We want to motivate the children to take part in a wide range of sport in and outside of school.  Regionally we are part of a network of 15 partner schools  (we are an expert centre for Global Learning through the GLP Programme)  we will share our learning with all of these schools.  At the annual sports days and final dissemination assemblies in both schools we will invite the local press to cover both events to spread the word nationally.  Our online presence on the web will also help disseminate the project results.\r\n\r\nWe will showcase our website and invite other schools into our school to demonstrate the new sports that we have learnt.  The MFL Lead in each school with be responsible for this, the MFL lead and Head Teacher have already successfully implemented a Comenius project and are experienced in the delivery of such a project from start to finish.  Our German Headteacher Frau Zientz works closely with the town councils in both countries and will play a key role in gathering publicity for the dissemination of this project. We will produce a 'guide to German sports' and the German school will produce a 'guide to English sports' which we will be made by the children, displayed in school and used as a working document. We are also members of the 'Allerdale Schools Sports Cluster' which is made up of 35 local schools, representatives of these schools will be invited to the final assembly so we can share our learning with these schools.", "http://www.dearham.cumbria.sch.uk", "Dearham Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA219-036513_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "CA15"}
