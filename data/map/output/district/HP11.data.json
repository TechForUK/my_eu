Some manufacturers make random checks on single components from batches of component lots. However, components especially the surface mount type are typically supplied on tape reels to assist with component feed for automatic component placement. The manufacturer cannot check all the components. Typically, a check includes visual inspection and in circuit testing. However, performing these checks is disadvantageous for two main reasons. Firstly, the tests can be time consuming and secondly it requires the component to be removed from the packaging or reel invalidating any guarantee to a claim should a counterfeit component be found. Currently, no automatic methods exist to speedily check each single component. In addition the cost of modern X-ray inspection systems prohibits their use for smaller manufacturing concerns. ChipCheck proposal is for the development of a novel X-ray inspection system for fast automated detection of counterfeit PCB components. The aim of such a development is to address the above issues. The system will be developed so that is capable of inspecting PCB components on tape reels and other component feeding mechanisms. In addition separate PCB components will also be examinable with the developed system.

The European Union accounts for 27 % of this traffic, with 90 % of Europe\u2019s oil arriving by sea. \u2022Over 2.5 billion tonnes of oil is used around the world every year, and 3 million tonnes is discharged every year into the oceans as a result of oil carrying vessel and tanker failures.

The industry is therefore continuously aiming for increases in integrated circuit miniaturization, processor speeds and circuit densities. The resultant increasing numbers of ever finer features on the silicon chip, and the need to electrically connect to them has stretched conventional wired or leaded electronics interconnect technology to its limits. This trend of miniaturisation with higher functionality looks set to continue, requiring fundamental advances in device electrical interconnect and mounting technology. Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) is a key technology that simultaneously addresses the requirements for high density fine feature electrical interconnect and physical attachment of silicon chip devices. BGA is a 2-D array of miniature solder alloy spheres under the silicon chip that provides both electrical connection and mechanical attachment to a mounting socket or circuit board. The small diameter of the solder alloy spheres reduces electrical resistance and capacitance and helps to preserve electrical signal integrity. BGA technology facilitates a reduction in the silicon chip package size, better heat dissipation, and greater module (circuit) densities.

They do not corrode; have a longer predicted service life, leading to less frequent replacement; they are less expensive to install due to their light weight and flexibility; and have significantly lower leakage rates due to having an all-welded system. However, their more widespread use is being restricted by the lack of a reliable non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method for the welded joints. Pipeline leakage does not only cause high repair costs but can also result in disastrous environmental consequences and even in loss of life.

In addition, the project will also develop an automated inspection system that will be able to inspect pipe-to-pipe and pipe-to-fitting (elbows, bends, reducers, tees, etc) butt and socket joints in various plastic pipe materials and diameters between 90 and 1000mm.

Following this, numerous welds with variable flaws were manufactured to develop inspection procedures and flaw acceptance criteria, based on both short-term and long-term mechanical performance.\n\nResearchers designed and manufactured novel phased-array probes and different probe holders and attachment mechanisms for the modular scanning system.

It is also asserted that the children who left school are under the risk of committing crime and early school leaving is described as the kindergarden of juvenile delinquency (Gavin, 1997).  The children falling into the category of early school leavers and juvenile delinquents are generally from disadvantaged backgrounds with fewer opportunities and are given priority by European Commission. \r\nOur project aims to provide key competencies to develop the measures to prevent early school leaving; to decrease the risk of those to commit crime; to guide them back to their education or vocational education to get qualified enough to find a good job and integrate them into social life; to develop a new joint methodology to tackle those; to prepare a e-training course including this new methodology and implementations; to train the adults dealing with these children and as a result  to contribute to decrease the rates of leaving school prematurely and juvenile delinquency to fewer than 10% by 2020.\r\nThe project targets mainly people who are in close relationship with truants and juvenile delinquents such as; parents, teachers, principals, community and juvenile police officers, counselors, lectures training these people etc. via on line in-service trainings.\r\nSeven different organizations from public bodies to NGOs with different expertise and experience about early school dropout and juvenile delinquency cooperate within the context of our project according to their expertise.
