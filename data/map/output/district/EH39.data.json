In accordance with the Scottish Government's 1+2 languages initiative, in accordance with the Barcelona agreement of 2002, we are in the first year of a programme to deliver an increasingly ambitious programme of language learning to all our pupils.  As part of the pilot cluster we are at the forefront of this in East Lothian and want to equip our teachers with the necessary skills and competences to deliver a successful language learning.\r\n\r\nOur teachers need to feel confident in the delivery of French and the aim of our project is for them to be immersed in the language and culture of France, so that they improve their fluency and learn about current methodologies most suited to the teaching of a foreign language.  The opportunity to visit French schools and gain an insight into a different education system will be of enormous benefit to their own professional development and to the wider school community.\r\n\r\nIt is our desire to train 8 teachers as part of this project.  We currently have 21 classes but a major expansion means that this will grow to 28 over the next three to four years.  A critical mass of trained personnel is crucial to the success of this project so that the knowledge and expertise gained can be shared with the wider staff team.\r\n\r\nThe chosen provider, Le Francais en Ecosse is a well regarded and experienced provider and the courses include intensive language and methodology lessons, learning about French culture and way of life, including the French education system.  A programme of cultural events will enhance the programme and teachers will be able to explore potential partnership arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe school has an established culture of global citizenship and the training will continue the journey that teachers have already embarked upon by starting their own learning in French or refreshing skills from earlier in their careers.  We anticipate that there will be a significant impact on the whole school, including the parent body, and will bring to life the learning of French by placing it at the heart of the school.", null, "Law Primary School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012933_coordinator"], ["4QS", "1&2 Language Learning Project", "North Berwick High School", 17051.0, "This project has with a view to train three secondary school teachers, who already teach French, in Spanish and Italian. The objective is to play our part in implementing the Scottish Government's 1&2 Languages Policy within our cluster, region and nationally. The three participants wish to take a lead role in delivering training to primary teacher colleagues so that they feel confident and enthusiastic to deliver some Spanish and Italian as part of daily language learning and awareness in their own schools. Further to this, we wish to increase the range of language that our own pupils can access at high school by providing more National Courses for them, and by introducing short language courses at senior level so that they may learn language for pleasure as well as attainment.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve our goals, we will attend immersion courses in Spanish and Italian, absorb as much of the language and of the teaching methodologies as we can, and disseminate these on our return to Scotland. We envisage that this will have a positive and sustainable effect on language learning and cultural awareness in our communities because we are established teachers in our region and can network widely. The training courses that we plan to run for primary and secondary colleagues will permit us to reach around 8000 young learners and 910 teaching staff and offer them the chance to enjoy learning language. Alongside the opportunity to enter into email exchanges with partner school in the countries that we have visited, we hope to bring languages more to life in our area and promote Scotland's place as a global player with an outward-looking, international perspective.", "https://www.edubuzz.org/northberwickhigh/", "North Berwick High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046878_coordinator"], ["4QZ", "Development of 1+2 Languages in Law Primary School", "Law Primary School", 14263.0, "Development of 1+2 Languages in Law Primary School\r\n\r\nIt is our aim that by 2020, all our pupils will be using French as part of the curriculum and in their daily lives at school.  \r\nIn accordance with the Scottish Government's 1+2 Language initiatives and the Barcelona Agreement of 2002, we are committed to delivering an increasingly ambitious programme of language learning to all our pupils.  Law Primary School is part of East Lothian Region who are at the forefront of this initiative. The 1+2 Languages Policy states that all children in Scottish Primary schools will learn 2 additional languages by 2020 and East Lothian Council has established its own strategy for the achievement of this aim.  \r\nThe development of languages is a key priority within our school, forming part of our School Improvement Plan, and we have a proactive approach to Global Citizenship and the international dimension of the curriculum.  We actively encourage links with our European partners.  We have 2 student teachers joining us from schools in Grenoble in April 2018.  We also have 6 qualified teachers joining our cluster from Bordeaux.  This is a continuation of a successful partnership from the previous years.  These visits have offered a reciprocal benefit with regards to language teaching and cultural exchange. \r\n\r\nIt is our aim to improve staff competence and confidence in the delivery of a foreign language and in using the appropriate methodology for our children.  Staff are keen to progress their own language skills which in turn will benefit the children they teach.\r\nWe want to equip our teachers with the necessary skills and competencies to successfully deliver language learning.  It is the aim of this project for our teachers to be immersed in the language and culture of France so they can improve their own language and fluency, returning with knowledge of the most current and effective methodology.  It is our desire to train 7 teachers through this project.  A core of specially trained teachers in our large school will help to disseminate the skills necessary to deliver high quality language learning to our pupils.  All 7  participants are qualified and highly experienced Primary teachers from across all levels of our organisation.  They have a desire to improve their language teaching skills for the benefit of the children, the community and the parent body, in accordance with our school's current improvement plan.  The learning will be disseminated to a wider audience through the use of on-line platforms and the Scottish learning portal GLOW. \r\n\r\nThe chosen provider LFEE is a well known and highly regarded provider of language training.  The mobility activity planned is an intensive immersion course which will equip participants with current methodology and best practice for delivery of a foreign language.  We anticipate that there will be a significant impact on the whole school and wider community both in the short and long term. Teachers will have the confidence to deliver language teaching and the learning of a language will be considered a key priority in our pupils' lives.
