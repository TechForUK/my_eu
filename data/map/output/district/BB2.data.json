We also impart 12 certificates of professionalism linked to the professional family of Personal Image.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Erasmus experience began in 2009 with the obtaining of our first letter ECHE (Higher Education). It was complicated, but today we can say that we have established, and consolidated, links with companies in the sector. Since 2014 we started the Erasmus projects for FP, having managed to implement 100% of the mobilities requested. Our commitment to internationalization is firm and we want to consolidate and improve it with this fourth initiative.\r\nAs a sending institution, our FP project focuses for the moment on mobilities of students for internships, taking advantage of the possibility of curricular validation through the FCT (Internship in Work Center). Although we must note that we also make mobilities for students and teachers of Higher Education.\r\nWe are also very active as host partners. We are always open to incoming activities for both teachers and students with similar skills. Having received this past year students from our specialties in Poland and also pending receipt from France.\r\nThroughout our experience as a shipping institution we have managed to consolidate our relationship with our partners in both Poland and the United Kingdom, where we have counterpart partners, small specialized companies in the personal image sector and also, in the case of Poland, with the help of intermediary partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this new edition, we have requested 4 mobilities for VET students; 2 for Poland and 2 for the United Kingdom. The number of scholarships will be distributed proportionally among the specialties and existing groups. If in some group or specialty there were not enough interested (a circumstance that is very unlikely given the success of the current project), that / s place / s would pass to the other group / specificity. In principle, they will be aimed at students of the intermediate degrees of the Hairdressing and Aesthetic specialties, but we consider the possibility of opening the experience to students of certificates of professionalism.\r\nThe beneficiaries of this project that will be part of their curriculum and will mark the beginning of their transition to the world of work are our second year students. Their ages range from 17 to 27 years (although the average age is in the 18-19 years) and the majority are women.

From our internal quality surveys, it is clear that a significant number show a great root for their local nuclei that leads them not to think about labor mobility in the future. However, this trend is decreasing each year, while at the same time there is a feeling of openness to Europe.\r\nAs for the selection process, we would organize an information day, set a deadline for formal application, and then the international department would choose the beneficiaries based on the academic results (35%), English level (30%), And the valuation of teachers (35%). In addition to this information days, there is a need to add more activities before mobility (signing agreements, international meetings, talks with host partners, language training, cultural and Erasmus + training with beneficiaries, etc.) during mobility (meetings / evaluations Weekly study leaders with the tutors of the host partner etc.) and after mobility (evaluation, dissemination of results etc.)\r\nIn terms of impact, students will develop a greater cultural background that will include better language skills and greater openness to other cultures. This baggage will also be academic and professional. When performing their practices in salons linked to VET centers they will know another educational system (we will also do the same with the incorporation of new methodologies) and work and different work techniques specific to the field of hairdressing or beauty therapy.

The project will focus on reducing prejudice towards refugees among young people. \r\n \r\nEurope is facing one of the biggest crises of refugees. Thousands of refugees daily enter Europe in search of better life. But more and more often Western societies accept them in a hostile way, believing that newcomers will take away their work, increase crime, inhibit their culture and this makes their inclusion more difficult. \r\nSurvey shows that 61% of Lithuanians don\u2019t support decision to accept and give asylum to refugees. Another survey shows that Lithuania remains a culturally closed country and that negative attitude towards Muslims and refugees drastically increased during 2015. Fear and unwillingness to welcome refugees to Lithuania is caused by complex reasons related to negative stereotypes coming from the period of Soviet Union, and the fact that Lithuanians still know relatively little about refugees and other cultures. So the role of all media channels is crucial. But often people are not properly informed about the issues related to refugees, immigrants and even Muslims. Mainstream media creates image of these people that can be misleading. Critical thinking and media literacy is very important in this case. The prejudices, stereotypes and negative assumptions make our society less inclusive to those, experiencing great difficulties.\r\n\r\nGroup of young people from Lithuania initiates \u201cBeyond the label #refugee\u201d aiming to reduce prejudice towards refugees among young people from Ukraine, Lithuania, England and Italy by exploring identity and culture, learning and sharing through dialogue, strengthening critical thinking and media literacy. \r\nTo reach this goal following objectives will be implemented: \r\n1. To organize 8 days long youth exchange (in Antaliept\u0117 village, in Zarasai district) involving young people from England, Italy, Ukraine and Lithuania.\r\n2.

Prior to this we have only taught Urdu as many of our children had gone on to study Urdu at GCSE. These lessons had been taught by a teaching assistant who is a native Urdu speaker and followed the Local Authority programme of study. 99% of our children are Asian heritage; most are bi-lingual.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that we now improve our staff competences in terms of language skills and methodology/pedagogy of language teaching and increase the involvement of all Class Teachers as none of the class teachers here have ever taught language lessons.\r\n\r\nWe would really like to also develop a European dimension as our children's experiences tend to be very mono-cultural (British Muslim). We would really like to develop links with a French Primary school so that our children will have an opportunity to increase their awareness of Europe in general and France in particular; learning about French life and French schools. \r\n\r\nThis now needs addressing as a matter of urgency in preparation for compulsory language teaching in KS2 in September. We need to develop teaching tools and resources. We are starting from scratch and it is a big job, but we have an Recently Qualified Teacher, supported by our Assistant Head, who is very keen to lead this subject and is committed to quickly developing the teaching of French and developing a curriculum which develops both the language skills, but also cultural awareness within our children and our staff.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase French language competences and increase cultural awareness, we plan to use Erasmus funding to access  language and methodology course in France. We intend to send 8 members of staff over a 2 year period on this exciting project.\r\n\r\nWe aim for French to be taught discreetly to the whole class for 1 session each week, we would then dedicate an area of each classroom to French. We are very well resourced with laptops and technology and we would ensure that opportunities for contact with children from the partner school were readily and easily available.The French that was taught would link to our topics and also would link to the English vocabulary that we are also still trying to develop.\r\nthe expected impact on the participants is:\r\n- they will be more confident in teaching French\r\n- their competencies in the teaching of a MFL will be vastly improved\r\n- they will be able to develop a scheme of work for the school and introduce the teaching of French for the first time\r\n- they will be able to support their colleagues who have not attended the course.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact on the children will be:\r\n- they are better prepared for the teaching of MFL when they attend High school.\r\n- by linking the teaching of French to the pre teaching of vocabulary and cross curricular teaching and learning that is already in place we will be strengthening oracy and literacy\r\n- the children will develop an awareness of the lives of children in another European country. \r\n- develop their openness toward other cultures and traditions\r\n- It will widen their horizons and provide future life opportunities that they may never otherwise experience\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to ensure that a high quality of learning and teaching of French and French culture in our school is sustainable. This will be achieved through a dynamic introduction to the teaching and learning of French, the continued support of a link French school and the peer to peer support that we will develop.", "http://www.stsilasprimary.co.uk", "St Silas CE Primary School", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002006_coordinator"]]}}}}
