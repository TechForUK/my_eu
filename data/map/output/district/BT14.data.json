Which is due to a number of causes: The training doesn\u2019t suit the student because it\u2019s above/below his or her level of education, isn\u2019t challenging enough, the student doesn\u2019t have a clear picture of the training or too great a deal of independence/responsibility is expected of the student. Students are being challenged by the outside world to live up to an image, conveyed through social media, something which influences them greatly. The future is still far away, but from a very early stage students are forced to come to a decision on what they want to do in life. This could lead to them making a choice, not based upon their own hopes and dreams for the future, but rather because they are being influenced by parents or friends. As a result, lots of students are dropping out. Whether or not a student is in the right place, will all too often only be checked after schools have sounded the alarm. The same few questions always seem to arise in the process: Are you more practice-based or more skilled theoretically? Is the training suitable? Do you need more guidance or would you rather start looking for a job? Years ago an appeal was made by the coordinator, whether or not schools recognized any of the above. Many of our colleagues responded to this appeal, as they were facing the same issues. They too had set out to combat these issues but as of yet, to no avail. Through this project we can start to bundle our expertise. The fact that it\u2019s our third time submitting this application, shows how strongly we feel about these issues. These past couple of years we have been communicating extensively among our ranks. Ideas and plans have been proposed and discussed and are ready to be put into practice at the start of this project. Here\u2019s what\u2019s in store. When a student transfers from one school to another, we want a \u2018mentor\u2019 at both schools, to help ensure a smooth transition. This way a bond of trust will be formed between student and mentor and makes it easier for any future issues to be resolved quickly. Especially vulnerable students require such close collaboration between schools. The following criteria are used to assess whether or not a student is classified as vulnerable: Is he/she able to transfer independently? Does he/she have behavioral problems? Are there any domestic issues? A file on the student\u2019s academic career, to be developed by us, will serve as a guideline for both mentors. Temporarily partaking in activities and events at the new school will also be part of the program. This way a student can get used to his new surroundings, and simultaneously find out whether the school suits him or not. Truancy is often the first sign leading up to a student dropping out, so we will look into simplifying the truancy protocol. Registration is key when it comes to truancy, but very often it is not registered adequately enough. Teachers have to know that it is of the utmost importance that a student\u2019s presence is registered properly. Training teachers accordingly is necessary. In case of a red flag, taking immediate action is essential. Formative talks will be held with the student on a regular basis, to see what the most logical next step would be: Further education or preparing them for a job search. A format for such talks is to be developed. We will also look into a possible \u2018time-out\u2019 at the student\u2019s current school. Sometimes the issues students face in their environment are so big, that it influences their behavior to too great an extent.  An internship, outside of school, could serve as a form of time-out to take away some of the pressure. The project will ultimately yield a wide range of new ideas and realistic, useful products to be adapted to the specific needs of every school involved. The good practices of all schools will be put together. With a variety of activities, to be organized by all those involved, the project is sure to enjoy widespread support. Everyone thrives on being seen and heard. A students exchange is not the sole purpose of this project but will undoubtedly serve as a beautiful, binding factor. The Domino Effect that we wish to create will be documented via E-twinning, for other schools to observe. Municipalities and Ministries of Education in the different countries will also be visited and involved in the project. With the one advantage, that they too will see the project\u2019s intention to serve the long-term. An ESL-coordinator will be appointed to each school, one who will track the developments made throughout the years. Evaluation will play an important part. Therefore we will do a measurement at the start of the project and compare these findings, to those obtained after years one and two and after five years. To measure is to know.

They choose topics most relevant to them, like for example work ethics, business etiquette, communication etc. The designed ICT modules are then tested in transnational meetings in a peer-to-peer training approach, evaluated thereafter, improved and disseminated to a broader set of students.In the 3rd year the focus shifts to the integration of refugees into the EU labour market with the help of ICT performed by students. Students design a questionnaire for employers on their experience with refugees and conduct a survey. The findings are incorporated in the ICT specifically designed for refugees. The training is carried out with teenage refugees at one of the schools, evaluated and adapted and enriched accordingly. Results of the survey, students' and refugees' experiences in the ICT are discussed in a panel discussion with students, refugees, companies and EU-officials. The ICT is then extended to a larger set of refugees.The students involved in \u2018LIIE\u2019 will come from schools with vocational specializations and the organization of the course varies. It will involve students from a wide range of backgrounds, including those from deprived areas of Belfast, those with special educational needs from Italy, to those of more affluent families from Norway and Germany. We aim to involve 240 students in face to face contact during the life span of the project, with this number increasing to 800 students over the 3 years within each school through indirect project work being undertaken on a local basis.The project is divided into smaller sub-projects in which students are in charge of their own learning with the support of teachers. They work in smaller teams and carry out blended-learning tasks. Students share their results at meetings, critically assess findings and discuss implications on their lives.Results are the \u2018factbook\u2019 including data on the labour markets and survey findings of participating countries, the presentations created in the course of the project especially on the results of the surveys and teaching materials for the ICT for both students and refugees. Modern technological devices will be used by all participants to help in the recording and communication of our project work, thus improving student\u2019s preparedness for the digital era.Expected impacts:- European growth has resulted in the need for a better understanding of the similarities and differences that exist between all nations. Our students need to be able to communicate and act successfully in global environments, showing an ability work with people from different cultural backgrounds.- In view of the challenging situation on the European labour market for young people, it is of special importance, that our students are aware of and able to seize the possibilities that each country offers.- The insights into business procedures and employer requirements as well as experience of inter-cultural cooperation will make our students more attractive to future employers.- The use of new technology and non-face-to-face communication technology in \u2018Future Working Skills\u2019 will prepare them for the challenges that lie ahead of them. - The co-operation with refugees will broaden the minds of our students, reduce prejudice and improve their multicultural skills. - Refugees learn about the cultures in which they live, promoting their integration into the job market.

In doing so, we are unlikely to spark enthusiastic responses to the subject from the children. Not too many children say that Mathematics is their favorite lesson and yet it could be so easily. Engineering is often described as the study of pattern which might help to explain its strong connections with art, leading to some of the most creative aspects of it.Integrating practical and theoretical knowledge in primary education institutions` curricula can provide opportunities for students to gain the skills needed now and in the future on the labor market, and thus improve their future employability. The local authorities in each participating country have identified a need to improve the quality of education in STEM subjects, particularly on the field of ICT, Numeracy and Business Studies for future employability, therefore the Strategic Partnership will support a project-based collaboration between students and staff, to develop, test and adopt a joint curriculum between participating Primary Schools, based on an exhaustive needs analysis and focusing on a \u201creal-life\u201d transnational approach.The aim of the project is to develop children's STEM (STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and mathematics) skills by introducing them to LEGO Robotics. Project objectives* To increase students\u2019 interest in STEM education and careers and introduced them to all available new trends in technology.* To provide tools and methodologies to facilitate the acquisition of STEM skills.* To develop collaborative partnership between schools and the wider community in formal, non-formal and informal learning.* To tackle the shortfall in women in the STEM sector at European level and increasing drop out rates of girls in STEM.Further to the above objectives we are to improve the quality of education in STEM and business studies and to increase the take-up of these subjects in upper secondary and higher education. The Strategic Partnership will support the development of better progression routes into higher education and graduation, with a specific focus on non-traditional learners, such as students from under-represented groups or with disadvantaged backgrounds, by transferring and testing innovative approaches.Robotics has established itself in recent years as a very useful educational tool, although emerging, especially in scientific and technological education. Educational robotics has been present in University, Polytechnic and professional stimulated by numerous competitions that are promoted as the First Lego League (FLL) and the RoboCup Junior. Our project will include founding LEGO clubs in each school and these LEGO clubs are used as an opportunity to introduce business studies to children at very young age. Our pupils will run these clubs as real businesses and learn how challenging and complex can it be to take part in entrepreneurship. These processes will involve creating business plans, how to set up a business, what legal identity is the best suitable, how to register with authorities.

The centres implicated are Turkey, Italy, Romania, Greece, Lithuania, Spain and Ireland.The profile that joins all the participants of this project is the great importance that we give him to the incorporation and attention to the diversity of our student body from a different and gratifying approach.Also they draw together a community of schools with a common interest to witness the enjoyment kids get from exploring different materials and techniques.The large team has been exploring the kid\u2019s ability to interact with the world around them and the main focus is to help them build fine tune skills needed for self expression and communication. Our joint vision is to give our students opportunities to develop their understanding from a European perspective.That is why we will achieve new and motivating experiences with other European schools, as well as the application of alternative methodologies; we will contribute the children\u00b4s innovation and improvement in the classroom.We think that it is an innovative project because we are given, to the professorship and pupils, by the opportunity to put into practice the changes and methodological innovations that we are working and discovering day after day.Also it is very new able to chance impressions and ideas with teachers of other countries, to value better the communicative sense of another language and, since not, to take a constant evaluation during the development of the project, aspect that will help us to improve and understand other communicative approaches to integrate them in our educational practice.As bilingual schools, we have made that some needs of our children aren\u00b4t covered. As we are teaching two subjects in English, the students with special needs have difficulties to communicate.We think the use of methodologies such as Cooperative learning, Multiple Intelligences or Project work will help us to reach our main objectives, which are: to use ICT in order to create motivating and meaningful activities,  know and share different methodologies in our classrooms, which benefit the attention to diversity and to know other countries and their cultures (languages, celebrations, methodologies, etc.).The activities will be carried out by students from 3 to 14 years old, although they will be designed according to age. Traditional tales and stories will be adapted to every level and classroom and the most important are; periodic meetings and visits to the countries partners, production of different activities related to Tales and stories: Trivial game, Gymkhana, Travel Book, Real story, and a short movie.  We strongly believe that the proposed activities will benefit our students\u00b4 basic skills. The Communication skills (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking and Talking/Conversing) are actions that children  need to develop their literary, linguistic and creative abilities. It is essential that children learn different readings, not only to increase their literary and linguistic level but also to face a rich education that develops both imagination and creativity, strengthening their self-esteem.The main reason for this project should be made to transnational level is that it will allow to begin bows of union at the personal level and professional between the members participants of different places of the world. They will put jointly on ideas, cultural traditions, and certainly works and experiences will be shared to carry out that they will facilitate the students, also in the future, an improvement of his learning.The project beneficiaries will be the entire educational community, that is students and teachers and, in addition to this, the families will be a fundamental pillar for this project, so much for his participation and interest, since for the opportunity to improve his communication.Likewise, we look for the collaboration of other entities, such as Special needs centres and Town halls, which will contribute the necessary material to include touristic elements of the environment for for activities with foreign teachers and children.The long term impact of our partnership has to do with the improvement of the quality of teaching and learning processes and the use of digital resources and also the  participation in other European projects.Throughout the Project students will undertake active research; the programmed will consist of innovative participatory methods for bringing topical issues to life. Each mobility will be triggered by a relevant site visit leading to practical activities.

According to the researches, 65% of people will be employed in new fields of occupation which are not even known today. It is emphasized about these occupations that 21st century skills such as digital skills, critical thinking, cooperation,team spirit, innovative and analytical thinking are required.Technology has been improving so rapidly that even internet of objects has begun to be discussed. It is of great significance for students to adapt to these constant and rapid changes in technology. Individual competencies in STEAM subjects (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) are getting more important for the occupations of future which are based on high technology. Therefore, innoative approaches are required in education. The curriculums not only in Turkey but also in other countries need to be revised because student motivation is not referred enough in STEAM subjects. Regarding this, the project has three main innovative approaches which enable students to be more participative in lessons:1.To increase readiness level of students in science and mathematics through art-in-museum activities.2.To develop students\u2019 competencies in technology and engineering with use of lego robots in education.3.To combine all these 3D designs, QR codes, experiment video quizzes and robot programming activities in STEAM subjects.These approaches make easy to provide particularly primary school students with basic skills in STEAM subjects and to teach technology, engineering, maths and science simultaneously. In addition, the students will be able to improve their basic coding and analytical thinking skills by writing instructions in lego robot. That will activate students\u2019 problem solving abilities while it also helps them develop evaluate things from different perspectives. This Project will also enable teachers to associate school subjects with each other more, highten student motivation, adopt innovative approach, focus on coding training and make use of technology for particular purpose. It will contribute to teachers\u2019 professional development and they will keep themselves up to date. While preparing students for occupations of future, teachers will train individuals who can easily comprehend to use robots, internet and other technological devices working on 3D technology and sensors. Museums are source of inspiration for art. Examining art works of different cultures, we will integrate art activities with science, technology and mathematics. This will help teachers build up creative lesson plans for STEAM and students have different perspectives, which will lead them to be more active and participative in lessons. It is evident that this will contribute to their academic success. For that reason,STEAM is of great importance. In a globalized world where internatonal interaction has been easier and more common, exchange of ideas and experience between teachers in different countries will help new methods and techniques be developed. Particularly face-to-face dialogues for a common purpose strenghten mutual interaction so that they can teach STEAM subjects more efficiently and effectively.  Before mobility begins, all the teachers in the project are required to take an online GoLab course. During the project, 3 transnational meetings were planned; the 1st is in Turkey, the 2nd is in Italy and the last meeting is in Macedonia. Planning, revision and outcomes of the project will be evaluated in these meetings. It is necessary to discuss on planning workshops, writing scenarios and lesson plans about STEAM, use of technology, programming and using lego robot software, and uploading experiment videos to GoLab. After each teacher participant returns from the meeting, they will disseminate the results by presenting them at staff meetings in their schools and others in the town. They will also prepare open-door exhibitions for their colleagues, students and parents to make it popular and sustainable. They also share outputs and their experineces via Project website, GoLab, eTwinning Project, flyers and e-magazines. Assessment of the project will cover pre-tests and post-tests about STEAM replied by teachers and students. In addition, it will be evaluated through satisfaction surveys. We prepare a free GoLab which have learning scenarios, lessons plans about STEAM activities that can be used inside and outside the school. We will produce an emagazine in seven languages in that the partners explain their experiences, how they integrate the STEAM with ICT. We also share the survey outcomes about our project results and give all for free.The other outcomes of our STEAM project will be the video lessons about lego robotics programs,3D design,art , math and orienteering games,QR codes in education and the science and engineering experiments.", "http://www.ballysillanps.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-TR01-KA219-034227_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BT14"}
