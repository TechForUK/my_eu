We are looking for new and innovative ways to make our school stand out as a centre of excellence in terms of languages, European dimension and international links. We want to have a great impact across all departments and phases and also within our primary feeder schools. We want to open up our school to Europe and share practice with European colleagues in terms of teaching, curriculum development and organisation. We believe that we have a lot to offer European colleagues and also a lot to gain from their experience.\r\n\r\nWe want to involve our whole school in this project and offer our pupils the best experience they can have and create a new generation of linguists with a love for languages and deep interest in culture and the lives of others. We want our pupils to feel fully \u2018European\u2019 and to envisage their future as part of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe want to further develop a \u2018cross phase\u2019 approach and Content and Language Integrated Learning. We want to improve children\u2019s Literacy through excellent teaching of languages, create links with schools abroad and improve intercultural understanding across the school. We also hope to update staff language competence and intercultural understanding, improve teaching methods, encourage cross curricular work and build links with parents and community.\r\n\r\nWe want to support children with specific needs and low basic skills, increase links with our cluster schools, increase children\u2019s motivation to learn and boost their international employment prospects.\r\n\r\nWe will integrate good practice from Europe into our own systems and create resources and training packages to support other schools and also to ensure a continuing programme of professional development in our own school.\r\n\r\nWe plan to develop extra-curricular activities- before and after school and give real purpose to language teaching and developing joint projects through \u2018e-twinning\u2019. We will increase the use of Europass to assess staff and students and  international professional networks for the sharing of resources, ideas and good practice.\r\n\r\nWe intend to develop an ambitious two year project which will result in us achieving our identified aims. We will involve staff from all departments, roles and backgrounds in order to achieve a true whole school approach and an impact felt in every aspect of our school life.\r\n\r\nWe would like the project to involve 100 mobility activities in total. 50 will be to France and 50 to Spain. This will allow us to include a large proportion of our staff in direct contact with the language, culture and education systems of Europe. The staff members who are not directly involved will have opportunities to develop their skills through the training and dissemination activities resulting from the visits. We believe that involving all of our staff in this way will lead to a great impact on our school and others in our cluster. It will develop momentum and a great sense of excitement and will lead to a great change in our outlook and the way we do things leading to teaching opportunities that go beyond outstanding. We will have the opportunity to pull together as a team across the school to ensure that we develop truly excellent practice, incorporating the best practice of Europ\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm and motivation of the staff will rub off on the pupils leading to better learning, greater uptake of languages and more ambitious students. This will lead to greater uptake of languages and a decrease in early school leaving.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project on our school will be huge. It will create a fundamental change in our practice and will mean that we are able to push our achievements beyond outstanding. We also intend to have a wider impact including other schools within our academies network, feeder primary schools, parents and the community. The envisaged impacts will include better language skills and greater intercultural knowledge of all staff, the introduction of the European dimension right across our school, in every subject area and embedded into all our practices, the integration of best practice from observation of European colleagues into our own practice leading to better teaching and learning, increased motivation of staff leading to better pupil motivation, the development of new materials, schemes of work and training programmes, the development of a strong network of support, the introduction of CLIL and greater cooperation with feeder primaries.\r\n\r\nWe will develop excellent links with Spanish and French schools leading to great benefits for all concerned which will greatly increase pupils\u2019 motivation to learn languages and give them a much wider outlook, seeing Europe as being somewhere that is relevant to their own lives.\r\n\r\nPupils will see beyond their own immediate surroundings and embrace difference and there will be increased cooperation across departments and more cross curricular work.", "http://www.ormistonvictoryacademy.co.uk", "Ormiston Victory Academy", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA101-002101_coordinator"], ["8DB", "CenterKids im SystemCenter", "Earlham Early Years Centre", 19903.0, "The project \u201eDeveloping competences for integrative education of small children\u201d including aspects of providing good health and nutrition standards for preschoolers and their parents in catchment areas of kindergartens, inhabited by disabled children and socially deprived families, is going on in Norwich, a middle-sized town in Norfolk, GB.

It began its journey in September 2003. Currently, it educates 1008 students of 23 different nationalities (since our neighbourhood, which brings together the beach and the port, has become an important focus of attraction for many emigrants who work in the service sector).

In response to the needs detected in recent years, our priority lines of intervention have focused on the development of \"inclusive\" methodologies based on the development of the 7 principles of dialogic learning, on the participation and involvement of families and our students in the decision making process in the school, with the creation of different commissions (infrastructure, pedagogy, new technologies, extracurricular activities and coexistence); in the application of different Educational Success Actions with the intention of improving results and coexistence as Interactive Groups; Literary circles; Library Tutoring; Dialogical Pedagogy Circles. These actions are proposed by the INCLUD-ED project (Strategies for inclusion and social cohesion in Europe from education that was a priority research line, level 7 project in the VI framework program of the European Commission) http: // www. includ-ed.eu/es.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\nThey are aimed at two areas of improvement, the educational quality of the school and the internationalization of the institution. We intend to improve the practical policies and inclusive cultures of our institution by observing other schools where they apply successful educational actions recognized by the scientific community. We want to get training in classroom practices and schedules that allow the accessibility of the curriculum to all students, especially those who are most vulnerable and with more barriers for learning and participation, thus reducing absenteeism and enabling the exchange of experiences.

All of them have a permanent position in the school and the firm commitment to continue its process of transformation.\r\nAmong the participants there is representation of the management team, the department of mathematics, spanish, biology, , technology, image, history, english, valencian, educational guidance, a specialist in therapeutic pedagogy and an expert teacher in European projects.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES\r\nTo achieve the objectives of quality and internationalization, a total of 13 mobilities will be carried out.\r\n4 mobilities of the JOB SHADOWING type and 9 mobilities of the COURSE type.\r\nThe proposed activities try to respond to the needs raised in the project in relation to the objectives of quality and internationalization.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY USED TO CARRY OUT THE PROJECT.\r\nThe active involvement of the entire faculty is of vital importance. Their participation is carried out  through commissions that manage the project or in the realization of the mobilities.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPACT\r\nOur main objective is to reduce school drop-out and increase the graduation rate in school graduates. Thus, this project responds to the transformation process of our educational community. The presence, participation and learning of the most vulnerable students at risk of social exclusion justifies the efforts towards a better school.\r\n\r\nAll our work makes sense if it is based on the ethical foundations that are promoted from an education based on excellence for all students.
