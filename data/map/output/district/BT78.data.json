The EC 2014 Big Data Strategy recognises that data-intensive sectors of the economy are growing by 40% per year. However, even while the UK, Germany, Ireland and Netherlands are leaders in big data at post-graduate and industrial level, if the digital economy is to flourish, data skills must move out of specialist R&D and be taught as a transversal skillset to students at all levels.  This provides a challenge to the VET sector, which is currently held back by its own deficit in data skills. The Smart Data, Smart Regions project will respond to this challenge by directly improving the ability of entrepreneurship VET policy makers and practitioners to understand, teach and implement smart data within their institutions. Moreover, it will help them use data to adapt and optimise entrepreneurship development strategies at regional level, becoming \u201csmart regions\u201d. To achieve this, partners will produce the following intellectual outputs:  a) Create and publish a STRATEGIC GUIDE TO SMART DATA IN YOUR REGION to make the case for an integrated, cross sector approach to smart data and facilitate the creation of Regional Partnerships. b) Establish 4 REGIONAL SMART DATA PARTNERSHIPS to bring together 50+ stakeholders from VET, HE, public and private sectors to develop 4 Action Plans for improving smart data\u2019s role in entrepreneurship policy, education and support in each region. c) Develop ESSENTIAL SMART DATA OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES: a curriculum, trainers\u2019 guide and suite of interactive online learning materials for VET teachers and trainers in colleges, enterprise development centres, incubators, non-profits and public authorities. d) Produce a SMART DATA ONLINE PLATFORM, a multilingual, interactive portal to maximize target group engagement and long-term impact of the educational resources.The project methodology is highly participative at all stages. Alongside their leadership of an intellectual output each, all partners will contribute to a proactive dissemination strategy, including multiplier events in each partner country and an international launch, and focussed quality management and evaluation activities which include our target groups at each stage: - At least 50 high-level representatives of organizations from the fields of VET, entrepreneurship education, and wider economic development will participate directly in 4 Regional Partnerships- At least 60 professional teachers and trainers of entrepreneurship skills working in VET organizations will be trained in the Essential Smart Data open educational resources, benefitting approximately 700 VET students will benefit - At least 200 representatives of stakeholder organizations will participate in multiplier events.  - Approximately 12,000 individuals will engage with the interactive online platform for the VET community interested in smart data skills. In terms of impact, Smart Data Smart Regions is a pioneering and transformative project because of its ability to overcome the smart skills deficit in two levels of the VET sector \u2013 practitioners and policy makers.  As a result of the project, more and more VET institutions will effectively integrate smart data skills into their curricula as a vital transversal skill for the knowledge economy, meaning that thousands of students learning entrepreneurship at VET institutions and or start up entrepreneurs gaining assistance from business development service providers will being using smart data analysis for their own projects.  In other words, the project will directly boost the ability of today\u2019s students to become tomorrow\u2019s successful entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and community leaders. The second target group - VET managers, policy makers and decision makers - will learn how to use data to adapt and optimise entrepreneurship development strategies according to their region\u2019s needs and opportunities, creating genuinely smarter regions in the short and long term.  They will be able to use data proactively to define future policy and will be more responsive to local needs and opportunities, creating a more tailored educational support system and generating more successful entrepreneurs.

The lack of female entrepreneurs is most evident in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Despite high profile role models, overall female innovativeness and participation in the technology sector has decreased and, \u201dan unconscious bias\u201d  still prevails. \r\n \r\nThe UK, Ireland, Germany and Spain are among the countries that have introduced measures to improve the institutional framework for female enterprise, but more needs to be done to overcome individual barriers, making sure that sure the small but growing number of females studying/working in STEM are helped to identify entrepreneurial opportunities and build their business skills.  The problem is that our VET institutions are ill-equipped to do so:  most are unspecialized in the specific strategies that are shown to work best with female entrepreneurs; their staff are trained in generic/traditional business models (not STEM) and they are not connected to universities /HE institutions to recruit graduate females emerging from STEM subjects.\r\n\r\nIn this context, WISE has a clear goal: increase the number of female entrepreneurs in STEM by transforming their access to and the quality of the training they receive from entrepreneurship VET institutions.  \r\n\r\nTo do so, we will: \r\na) Establish sustainable, cross-sector collaborative relationships between actors in STEM entrepreneurship development ecosystem via 4 Regional Partnerships leading to 4 WISE Regional Action Plans. \r\nb) Create and publish a WISE Toolkit to facilitate the replication of Regional Partnerships across Europe. \r\nc) Develop, implement and publish a suite of multilingual educational resources entitled Start up in STEM for entrepreneurship VET practitioners to update their knowledge and skills,\r\nd) Design and implement innovative learning placements for 40 young women with STEM start up potential in high growth STEM enterprises (preferably female led.)\r\n\r\nThe project methodology is highly participative at all stages, involving our three main target groups (training providers such as enterprise centres, colleges and incubators; female entrepreneurs and wider stakeholders) in the following ways: \r\n- At least 50 high-level representatives of organizations from VET, entrepreneurship education, and wider economic development will participate in 4 Regional Partnerships\r\n- At least 60 professional entrepreneurship teachers and trainers will be trained using the Start up in Stem open educational resources, benefiting approximately 600 female students \r\n- At least 230 representatives of stakeholder organizations will participate in multiplier events.  \r\n- Approximately 7,500 individuals will engage with the interactive online platform with OER.\r\n\r\nThanks to improved exposure/availability and improved quality of entrepreneurship education opportunities, WISE will generate an increase in the overall number of potential and existing female entrepreneurs engaged in continuing VET and it is more likely that early stage female STEM entrepreneurs grow their ideas into successful STEM enterprises in the short term.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Regional Partnerships and Start up in STEM educational resources, managers, teachers and trainers in VET institutions will overcome existing bias, update their own skills and modify service provision in their institutions to be more inclusive and better support high growth STEM enterprises. \r\n\r\nAt regional level, the project will create a more enabling environment for female entrepreneurs and generate the knowledge sharing and feedback loops which will contribute to ongoing improvement and the development of further initiatives.\r\n\r\nSTEM is a particularly important area of focus across Europe, not only because of the scale of the gender gap, but because of its ability to generate high growth businesses which drive innovation and economic development forward in Europe.   For this reason, we believe WISE will not only generate significant impact at local level through the Regional Partnerships, but will capture the attention of policy makers and actors further up the ladder nationally and across Europe.

Our specific objectives are:\r\na) Develop a Good Practice Catalogue (IO1) to introduce business advisors to the value of using and teaching digital competences to entrepreneurs and SMEs\r\nb) Create a Digital Changemakers Toolkit (IO2) providing them with practical guidance on how to incorporate 20 of the best digital (online) learning tools into their work \r\nc) Craft an online learning course (IO3) to consolidate advisors\u2019 skills and confidence in using mobile and digital learning resources and their ability to recommend digital solutions to their clients.\r\nd) Engage business advisors and VET organizations in the development of the above, train the first group of Changemakers as coordinate an aggressive dissemination strategy, in order to facilitate the mainstreaming of systematic professional development opportunities for the business advisory community on this topic.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impact of the project will be an increase in the digital competences of advisors and trainers involving attitudinal change, knowledge acquisition and skills and confidence development. Business organisations that support their advisory staff to upskill in this area, will progress along their own path to becoming digitally competent educational organisations.\r\n\r\nBy improving the skills and attitudes of business advisors to increase their own digital competences, use of digital pedagogy, we will increase the overall effectiveness of entrepreneurship education (across all areas of entrepreneurship training), and also become agents of change to improve the digital competences of entrepreneurs and SMEs. Locally and regionally, more entrepreneurs will achieve more success in growing their businesses; this could lead directly to increases in employment as well as broader economic growth.
