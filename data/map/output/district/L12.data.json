We think to be innovative in the future it is necessary not only to have competences in the so-called typical school subjects but also to have competences like tolerance, self-confidence, creativity, team spirit, responsibility on one hand. And on the other hand it is important to have economical and financial knowledge as well as entrepreneurial competences like time efficiency, risk-taking and distribution of tasks.The working people of tomorrow will live in a globalized world which is changing constantly and so it must be \"normal\" for them to appropriate new working methods and to use new technologies. They will work not only in one country but it will be normal for them to earn their living everywhere in the world. We want to increase their self-confidence with the help of this project where they have to use English as a tool for communication with people from other schools and companies.In this project we found an international pupils' company to develop the entrepreneurial skills of the students.We have two kinds of outcomes:1. Like in \"real\" companies the staff has to be trained. We offer our pupils the opportunities to learn about different careers and professions and all the necessary entrepreneurial skills for a successful entry into the professional world.We create a new material about job orientation with all our experiences in this field from the last two years in a big variety:flyers , brochure, DVD. This material will be distributed and used at our three participating schools (and/or at other interested schools) in order to have better results in job orientation.  We will use our school websites to promote this material.2. We all together develop new biobased teenagers' cosmetics. That means we create new creams, soaps, lotions, peelings etc. on the base of plants (herbs or/ and flowers). The focus of the work of the Liverpool school in the pupils' company is the promotion and marketing of the new products.In the centre of the work of the school in Meissen is the production of the new cosmetical items.And the main part of the school in Kielce in our project is the packaging and recycling of packaging in the production process.We are sure that we can only be successful when we work closely together with local stakeholders as schools normally don't have \"production facilities\".Our future products in the field of biobased cosmetics will be distributed/ sold in the following four forms:1. We offer  \"Self-made instructions - how to make my own biobased cosmetics\" in form of flyers or on our websites.2. We offer \"Self-made instructions - how to make my own biobased cosmetics\" together with the necessary ingredients.3. We distribute samples of our biobased cosmetics at our participating schools to have a feedback about the quality of our products.4. Together with local stakeholders (especially in Meissen) we try to develop a new line of biobased teenagers' cosmetics and to find a strong partner in the cosmetic industry.Our focus is not only to improve the economical abilities of our students but also to improve their foreign language and cultural knowledge. We use English to communicate via eTwinning, present our school and organize city walks \"Pupils guide their guests through their hometown\" in our three towns.", "http://www.cardinal-heenan.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE03-KA219-023026_1"]]}}}}
