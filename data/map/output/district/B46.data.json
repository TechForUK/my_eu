Teachers\u2019 further training and field observation in a school of another European country are also of utmost importance, in order to collect experience and to make ourselves acquainted with good practices, which will be a part of the new policy of our High School.

We aim to focus on a number of topics such as dealing with school violence / bullying, early school dropout, setting rules about the right use of mobile phones and devices in general, the field observation and registration of teaching methods and infrastructure used both in conventional classrooms and laboratories. Through this observation we aim to change our own way of thinking and behaviour, in order to accomplish the targets of our plan for right and extrovert policy.  One of the first expected results is the activation of the other teachers in European programmes / actions, with the motivation of the interaction with European colleagues and the accomplishment of several common actions, by bringing a European dimension to their school and making it into an educational institution which provides everyone with training opportunities and co-working with other European educational institutions. As far as students are concerned, they will gain self-confidence in the use of foreign languages and they will improve their educational level through their constant contact with pupils from all over Europe.  In addition to this, it will strengthen their European profile and even enable them to search (in future) for a work position in an European country outside Greece.

implemented in the sector of web design at School for Art, Design, Graphics and Clothes Zabok (SUDIGO Zabok) in the period of 12 months (19th June, 2017 \u2013 18th June, 2018). There are 95 students of that sector in our school and 4 of their teachers and a professional associate (school\u2019s librarian) will carry out this project as a preparatory activity for introducing bilingual education at our school. During the project implementation, five members of the project consortium (an English teacher, Web Programming teacher, Art teacher, Web Design teacher and a librarian) will attend separate courses in Malta, UK, Italy and Belgium, will develop an online glossary of terminology related to web design and will hold six pilot bilingual classes of Web Programming, Web Design and Art.\r\nThe project\u2019s main objective is introducing CLIL methodology in the sector of web design and enabling the pilot lessons of bilingual education in the second grade of web design, that is, in the subjects of Web Programming, Web Design and Art in the period of the project\u2019s implementation, and later in the whole sector (1st to 4th grade). Project team will decide on key terminology of these three subjects which will be included in e-Glossary and used in lessons as a preparatory activity for setting up bilingual classes planned in school year 2019/2020. The project will also improve the curriculum of web design (implemented at SUDIGO Zabok in 2013/2014) with the usage of new teaching methods and tools and the development of language, communication and professional skills of both students and teachers which will enhance the students\u2019 possibilities for further education or employment within Croatia or in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe project's fist phase includes teachers' mobilities whose purpose is to develop their language and professional skills. The planned mobilities are: a two-week course CLIL Methodology and ICT Tools for Teachers with CLIL (St.Julian's, Malta), a one-week course CLIL Bilingual Education in Web Design (Ipswich,England), a one-week course T&T: Teaching and Technology for European Teachers (Soverato, Italy), a one-week course SCHOOL REVOLUTION! Flipped Classroom and Innovative Didactic Methodologies (Brussels, Belgium) and a two-week course Using Technology for Teaching English (Cardiff, Wales). \r\nWithin this phase e-Glossary will be issued. Its purpose will be to enhance language competences of the students and teachers but also of elderly citizens involved in the school's project ''We still want to learn'' where they are being taught by our students basic digital skills.\r\nE-Glossary will consist of around 100 key terms explained with the context of each subject and their common usage and translated into Croatian. The e-Glossary will serve as a foundation of bilingual education set up in 2019 but it will firstly be used in pilot bilingual classes and then upgraded in optional classes of the school's librarian in the school year 2018/2019.\r\nIn its second phase the teachers of Web Programming, Web Design and Art will prepare and give 6 lessons in English language (pilot bilingual classes) whereas the English teacher will use the e-Glossary in her classes as part of English for special purpose lessons.\r\nThe third phase or the sustainability of the project in 2018/2019 is the preparation and creation of the new curriculum for bilingual education in web design (which will include the above mentioned subjects), creation of teaching materials in English, organization of optional classes for upgrading the e-Glossary and obtaining the necessary language certificates of the levels of English language mandatory for bilingual education by Regulations on bilingual education in one of the European languages in elementary and secondary education.", "http://www.glocalfactory.eu", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HR01-KA101-034999_4"], ["3BL", "Digital Extra -SMILE", "Elderberry Gryd Limited (Trading as EUcourses.eu)", 7313.0, "It is a project that resulted from the need to renew the European orientation of the school and the teaching methods on traditional and modern subjects.\r\n\r\nIt includes as basic actions the participation in two mobilities which are linked with trainings. The first has to do with training on new technologies(notably video production ) and intercultural issues and how they can be integrated with innovative methods in the school curriculum. The second action takes the issue of interculturalism a step further, by engaging museums as institutions that can not only play a key role in teaching various subjects but also in consolidating the collective European Identity(Competence). These actions will be continued after the end of school mobility by creating projects which are related to the training items.\r\n\r\n The key objectives are to acquire skills related to e-learning, distance learning, new technologies, cultural issues and the use of museums in the educational process. It is also desirable to build lasting relationships with colleagues across Europe . The experience of the realization of the European project is another key objective.\r\n\r\nThe project includes seven mobilities which can be allocated to \u2013four to seven teachers of different disciplines- according to its development and the school day life.

Nevertheless, despite its significant size, one may notice some backwardness as far as students' and teachers' international mobility is concerned and also concerning its policy on European openess compared to other schools of the same size situated in big urban areas of the South West.\r\n\r\nConsequently, and starting from this analysis, at the moment we are writing the school project which determines the goals of the school for the years to come, it appears to us indispensable that teachers who are fully involved train themselves in new methods of teaching in order to develop a yearning for foreign languages and a feeling of being European among the students.\r\n\r\nOur goal, in territories which today tend towards ostracism, is nothing else but to encourage our students and those from the secondary schools of the area, to open their eyes on the unique opportunity of travelling to train themselves, study or work in a European Union country.\r\n\r\nForeign languages (Spanish and English), History and Geography, Philosophy, French as a Foreign Langage and Plasctis Processes teachers have been working relentlessly on this project to reverse the trend.

It is of great value to learn and get experience from other countries and create new tools from an educational perspective and the European cultural identity in adult learning. \r\n\r\nWe intend to offer our 35 faculty teachers to participate in the project \u201cInternationalization and Didactics in Practice\u201d in order to get skills in internationalization of adult learning and strengthen their didactic ability in the school\u2019s teaching job. These increased skills are going to be obtained during the project, its mobilities and many other activities, together with our partner EUcourses.eu and new partners.

With the help of a digital meeting place EPALE for all who are involved in adult education throughout Europe our teachers will be able to create network for future cooperation with colleagues in the whole Europe which can benefit the experience and knowledge exchange with participants from Sweden and other European countries.

This therapy focuses on the supportive and consolidative interaction of art elements with the creative process,personal development, character and mental health. The main problem areas that we can take art therapy are such as the following: anger management, communicative skills, reconciliation with the past, chrisis management, coping with trauma/anxiety/stress, developing motivation and self-confidence.The prisoners and the participants in the Public Mental Health Centre struggle against such problems in their daily lives. During this process, we aim to provide the prisoners and adult learners on psychiatric medication in the Public Mental Health Centre with  rehabilitation and integration into the society. We aim to enable them to canalize their energy and surges of emotion into creative arts and thus both reveal their potential skills and develop a sense of self-confidence.Through the art courses we arrange at the Prison, we aim to enable the prisoners to cope with anger and to lower the recividism rates.We also aim to achieve the integration of the prisoners as productive and self-confident individuals able to cope with stress when their imprisonment is over. \r\n\r\nOur project involves one of the key priorities of the EU2020 strategy, the social inclusion of disadvantaged individuals.We aim to increase the capacity of our insitution to meet the needs of disadvantaged learners.

The school is composed of a primary school, a lower secondary school and a boarding school for girls and boys. We have 320 pupils. 12 members of staff of which 8 secondary school teachers, 2 primary teachers and 2 members of the administrative staff have decided to get involved in the project.\r\nRESPECT OF EACH PERSON AND OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nTwo priorities have been identified. First, the staff of our school (teachers, educational staff, administrative staff, the Principal) has noticed that our students  coming from very heteregoneous backgrounds don't necessarily show respect to their classmates, the staff members, the material or the premises. \r\nWe welcome in our boarding schools at any time during the year new students due to social, educational, financial or other motives   Some students also leave us during the year for the same reasons. It is our duty to welcome them in our institution as best we can, to enable them to trust us, to help them like school, the place where they can get the best preparation for their future professional life.  Respect towards each person  must be shown so that our students feel good at school. A renovated, active and personalized policy of welcoming everybody, trying to understand everyone, whether be it when they first arrive or during their stay with us is vital.  The project WOW aims at welcoming everyone in our school in the respect of his/her past taking his/her weaknesses and strenghts into account.  A positive and tolerant atmosphere will enable our students to concentrate on school. Our second priority is to open the school towards the outside world: the town, the charities in our region and the parents. We want to open the doors of our school and work with them for a better understanding of each other. Finally we think that it is vital to widen our intercultural approach so that our students can fit in tomorrow's world at best. Through E-Twinning or other exchange projects they should become aware of the necessity to understand another language and work with citizens from the European Union. Focus on foreign language is then essential.\r\nTRAINING SESSIONS FOR A PERSONALIZED APPROACH AND OPPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD\r\nA group of 12 staff members have volunteered to attend training sessions about various topics all through Europe. The courses dealing with Multiple Intelligences, preventing bullying, Hidden Talent in your classroom or Inclusive teaching were chosen to help us understand how we can better work wih our students.  Partnership with the outside world will be achieved through a training session about the way to discover the city and observation in a finnish school. Other training sessions concern languages (English, German and italian) to show that interculturality is really important to us.  Finally a training session about the European citizenship and multiculturality in the European projects is also planned. These training sessions will enable us to achieve our goals of accepting everyone in a respectful atmosphere, reducing the school dropout and widening our cultural horizon. \r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\nThe first training sessions focus on languages (English, Spanish, German and Italian) so that the following courses are attended without linguistic apprehension. Follow the courses about inclusive education, hidden talent in the classroom, anti-bullying or multiple intelligences. The other partners in the project (parents, students, teachers) will be asked their opinion through surveys so we can adjust our project. The whole staff will be informed through meetings. (for the teachers every 6 week and for the rest of the staff twice a year). \r\nIMPACT\r\nFor our students, the impact will be seen through a renewed involvement in school, a better self-esteem and  trust towards other but also with better relational, intercultural and academic skills. The teachers will manage their classes in a different way for a better teaching and learning. For our school the impact will be a new positive and committed image in the large communities of parents, mayor, members of our Foundation and  the academic authorities of Alsace.\r\nBENEFIT\r\nThe benefits can be from a personal point of view for our students, staff members  but are also institutional.

The first one concerns a seminar on the issue of \" detection and exploration of the productive resources of the city\" and will involve two teachers. The second one refers to the issue of \"use of portable electronic devices as educational tools\" and will also involve two teachers. The structure and methodology of the mobility programmes are in line with the basic axes of our strategic plan. \r\n\r\nThe planning and preparation of the project is based on the cross-curricular cooperation between the two educational sectors of our school, ICT and economy. What is pursued through this cooperation is to create cross-curricular teaching modules and designate the  interacting relation between technology and economy within the context of the market. The optimal teaching method is assumed to be the \"learning-by-doing\" active involvement of the students, which will detect the possibility of implementing modern technology in the broader economic and social context of the city and the market, transforming the latter into a filed of educational perspective and interaction. Thus, students will recognize and familiarize themselves with market issues and will suggest solutions with the use of modern technologies.  \r\n\r\nThe participants will be elected by a committee created by the teachers of our school. As regards the election criteria, these are the level of knowledge and fluency in the english language, as well as ICT skills, the ability to implement and spread new or novel teaching techniques and incorporate them in the teaching process, as well as participation and contribution to the preparatory stage of the programme.\r\n\r\nIn all phases of the project, participants will focus on raised objectives and apply their knowledge in their work, enabling positive changes in the school organization.

Both courses foresee the self-assessment of learning outcomes and the recognition of competence acquired by teachers through a certificateThe resources will be launched, pilot tested and widely disseminated across Europe.The dissemination strategy is oriented to reach the school sector, at first, as well as relevant stakeholders active in other sectors, such as public libraries, e-book and digital publishers, local organisations, \u201cGLAM\u201d actors, technologists and digital makers, citizens. Sectorial and cross-sectorial strategy will rely on 12 multiplier events organised in 6 countries and further activities, such as the circulation of 2 recognizable brands (Augmented reader and Augmented teacher), press-conferences, e-newsletters, mass-use of social networks.Structurally embedded in the logic of the project are:-          1 Joint Staff training Event held in Cyprus to deepen The Living Book approach and ICT-enhanced reading-          4 short term exchanges of groups of pupils in RO, PT, CT and EE. A unique occasion for 24 students from vulnerable groups to take part in an international experience and collaborate with EU peers in reading activities and experiences of augmentation.Main impacts on teachers will be: increased competence in cultivating young students\u2019 motivation and reading abilities; a greater responsiveness to the needs of disadvantaged groups by developing, amongst others, competences in involving parents to support pro-reading strategies. In the medium/long term, these impacts will be sustained by: the availability of multilingual OER; the creation of communities of Augmented Teachers, that favour networking, and stimulate continuing professional development in this field.Main impacts on students will be: Fostered a positive attitude towards reading and greater motivation thanks to the attractiveness of the blended approach proposed, the social dynamics created, and the support of parents. We expect this impact to be amplified in the medium-long term: dissemination activities, carried out even after the end of the project promoting the Living Library, will generate a higher number of users, thus increasing the community and fostering an even higher engagement on the side of participants that have participated in its testing and creation", "http://www.gryd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CY01-KA201-017315_7"], ["3BL", "Grandma's Story - Engaging migrant youth in their local communities", "GRYD LTD", 230345.0, "The project \"Grandma's Story\" - Engaging migrant youth in the local community\r\n\r\naims to produce\r\n\r\n1.

The objective is to develop a comprehensive training material for the target group youth workers working with refugees and their children, intercultural learning environments, often in their second language about their history in a setting of migration, tolerance and diversity. The secondary target group is educators working museums and galleries, heritage and community associations especially those within areas of larger ethnic minority populations.\r\n\r\nDocumenting Patterns of Migration and Integration as a resource for training in Youth work. the project will begin by recognising and recording the stories of the \u201cGrandmothers\u201d. The older generation of women whose stories are seldom collected or retold. The stories upon which the project is based are found all over Europe. Young women left their homes and migrated to another country or region. Through hard work they established themselves and to varying degrees integrated into their new homeland.  The narrative is similar even if every story is unique:\r\n\r\nI had to move because it was even impossible to survive cultivating the ground\u2026\r\nI had to move because of the war\u2026\u2026.\r\nI just deserved a better life\u2026\u2026\r\nWe were exchanged.......\r\nI came because my husband came to work.......\r\n\r\nThe aim is not specifically to look at why people left but to record the migrant women\u2019s story of migration and integration. We wish to learn from Grandma\u2019s experience. We will specifically look at stories from the West Midlands UK in the 1970's and 80's, Russian speaking women in Estoina, newly arrived refugees from the Middle East to Italy, Roma and other minorities in Sweden in the 1970,s and 80's and the exchange of population between Turkey and Greece in the 1950's. The objetive is to develop this core information into a methodology that can be repeated in any EU country.\r\n\r\nSince the end of the Second Word War, migration flows have increased in all EU Member States, either through immigration or emigration. Today migrants from third countries account for around four percent of the total EU population. Europe is confronted with an ageing population and a shrinking workforce \u2013 leading to labour and skills shortages that will challenge economic growth prospects. Increased migration is seen by many economists as a positive factor to growth. Consequently countries that make the best use of their migrant population have the best prospects to develop. The current context/crisis concerning migrants, refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflict from the Middle East and North Africa is part of an ongoing narrative. This narrative will seemingly continue and managing migration flows will continue to be a challenge for all EU society. Youth work has a key role in forming a society in which citizens have equal rights and opportunities in health, employment, personal growth and development and unhindered access to public goods and services with a view to ensuring social cohesion, social inclusion, multicultural coexistence and economic development of the EU.", "http://www.gryd.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-3-UK01-KA205-035162_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B46"}
