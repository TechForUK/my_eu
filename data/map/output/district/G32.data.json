Therefore, CIDAR builds upon the expertise of the UK's and Spain\u2019s world-leading groups in fibre-lasers, laser based gas and particulate detection, opto-electronics, and chemical species tomography (CST), allied to its industrial strengths in aero-engine manufacture and aviation fuel technology.\n\nThe CIDAR project aims to establish a world-leading capability in the non-intrusive measurement and 2D imaging of nvPM/soot and CO2 concentrations in aero-engine exhaust. Non-intrusive planar tomographic measurement of CO2 will be based on calibration-free Fibre-Laser Absorption Spectroscopy and soot measurements will be based on laser-induced incandescence (LII).\n\nValidation of both imaging technologies will be carried out at the INTA Turbojet Test Centre using large civil turbofan engines, providing data analysis and measurement uncertainty of the current state of the art measurement systems.\nThe measurement system will then be developed to a maturity level of TRL6 with a clearly identified route to commercialisation.", 89302.0, 1945815.0, "CIDAR", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_213940_911890017"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["9AA", "Spanish Teacher Refresher Course", "Eastbank Academy", 3134.0, "The primary focus of my interest in participating in this Teacher Refresher course is to render me a more competent, experienced, knowledgeable and confident MFL classroom practitioner. I look forward to engaging with the course content, learning new teaching methodologies and exploring innovative pedagogical practices. In attendance, I am eager to liaise with fellow teachers from across Europe with the opportunity of linking classes, twinning schools and participating in shared projects.As a consequence of my participation and successful completion of the course, the insight gained, the proficiency acquired and the new relationships/friendships with foreign students, will serve to further enrich my pupils' learning in the classroom dynamic.The bolstering and further of Modern Foreign Languages articulates very well with the current mindset of the Scottish Government and articulates very well with the European dimension, as outlined in my school's development plan, geared towards helping young people to acquire a view of Europe as a multi-cultural, multi-lingual community and to stimulate an interest in and to boost competence in other European languages.On a local level, I would propose meeting with fellow MFL teachers to raise the awareness of this most practical and useful  Continuous Professional Development, cascading down activities undertaken, training imported and didactic knowledge acquired.Participation at regional - indeed national - events within an MFL educational framework will enable me to disseminate my findings on the course, relating my impressions, experience and benefits yielded to various stakeholders.On the European front, I propose exploring - where appropriate - a meaningful professional dialogue with partner schools in Europe to identify ideas of common purpose and goal-setting, where MFL learners in these partnership establishments might be enriched by a shared interest and a positive linguistic, cultural and social relationship.", "http://www.eastbankacademy.glasgow.sch.uk/", "Eastbank Academy", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023474_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "G32"}
