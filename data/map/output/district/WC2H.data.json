The vocational training must respond to this development with its interface (function) role bitween the education and employmentsystem. Therefore, the internationalisation of our three vocational colleges (1550 students) is an important goal in the school's development. A learning abroad/internship in other European countries is a particularly effective tool for the students. Especially the importance of vocational education for the social development and the professional  perspective of each individual (every student) is undisputed. To gain intercultural experiences and skills while in school education, to deepen knowledge of foreign languages and to secure a head start when entering the profession is becoming increasingly important for many students. Furthermore, a learning stay abroad encourages andboasts the self-confidence and strengthers the emotional stability.\r\nParticipants: Per year, of the three vocational colleges, 96 students, 6 teachers/educational staff of the project group and 2 accompaying persons can apply for a scholarship. The students undergo an initial training/schooting with advanced professional knowledge in the following branches: Social & Health System, Nutrition & Home, Medien & Communication (Design Technical Assistant-GTA), the technical school of social work - social education.\r\nActivities: The students will complete a four-week intenship with project partners. Health/social/education branch:e.g. childrengarden, special scholls or facilities for disabled people in Finland/Sweden/Denmark. Facilities in Northern Europe especially  practise innovative approaches in the areas of early intervestion, education and inclusion. Countries in Northern Europe promote and practise the early intervestion and inclusion more professionally than other European countries. \r\nMedien & Communication (GTA branch): Many countries are very open-minded towards the social media and multimedia education. The GTAs get to know the future-oriented and innovative practises and new techniques through the project partners. They get introduced to the independent project management. The project partners define the project work in advance.\r\nProject implementation: The project group of the vocational colleges is responsible for organising the stays abroad. Appropriate project partners in European countries are build up, contractual frameworks (fixed contact, learning agreement/project agreement, support, language course, valuation) are defined. The information seesions for students/parents is followed by the application. The students are selected through an application process. Then preparation seminars follow. During their stay abroad they are accompanied by the project group/person of trust and their local contact (supervision, own facebook group). Following the stay abroad the students prepare completion reports and an assessment/evaluation is done. Public relations (press releases, school website, presentation at an open house) complete the project.\r\nResults: The students will gather knowledge and experience of other cultures, peoples , nations and behaviors. They can compare the working and living environment in the European area . They will expand their intercultural and social competences and strengthen their own cultural identity. The students will be able to make a more accurate picture of their professional career . The professional perspective is improved and the choice of professional is strengthened. Language skills and self-confidence are encouraged. They will change their view on Europe and the European Community. The commitment of the school to praticipate in the program Erasmus+ will be seen positively.\r\nThe educational staff: Learn impulses and appropriate tools for school development, strengthening of the European idea and internationalisation of the vocational colleges, expand intercultural competence and train intercultural sensitivity, international networkling and networking of partners with own school projects (e.g. Fair Trade , UNICEF , worldwide missionary projects SMMP , school against racism), promotion of young professionals.\r\nLong-term benefits: The students gain an edge in the career, it is a gain of experiences, self-confidence is strengthened and advanced language skills shape the future career. Young professionals are encouraged. The students  consolidate their decisions.\r\nPositive image and - so far - unique feature of the three vocational colleges of Walburgisschule Menden SMMP.

After successful completing of various projects and competitions held at school, Slovak and international level, this mobility project will enable all the participants to develop their knowledge, skills and abilities of professional, social and linguistic character. By this mobility project, The Business Academy Nev\u00e4dzov\u00e1 3  fulfills its European School Development Plan and contributes to its internationalization and opening to the world.  We expect from the project \u201eExperience practice abroad 2\u201c a contribution to improving the quality of vocational training, gaining practical experience, knowledge and skills in working and learning environments of the partner organizations. We would also expect the recognition of acquired knowledge and learning outcomes in a qualification profile of a participant. By meeting  this objective we want to achieve an increase in professional eligibility of students and broaden the scholary perspective of teachers of vocational subjects. Lessons learned will be carefully evaluated and processed in other future international activities.\r\n The aim of our project is to enable the comparison of practice at our and at partner schools  abroad,  to gain new inspiration, new procedures and teaching methods, enable students to get valuable experience at a foreign employer. The Project participants will include  teachers of vocational subjects or school management (6 participants) and students (10 participants ) with excellent academic results and exemplary behaviour. They will be carefully selected by an expert commission on the basis of questionnaires. Participants will gain valuable competencies that will be recorded in documents:  Europass \u2013 Mobility and The Certificate of foreign practice completion.\r\nThe result of the project will be the new benefits and the modernization of teaching  and curriculums of  vocational subjects, new inspiring examples,  relevant experience of pupils and teachers from the foreign practicing, enhancing the reputation of school for current and future students.\r\nThe project will help to raise teachers' awareness of their own competence and real  assessment of their professional level when compared with  foreign colleagues. After completing the five-day lesson observations of specialized subjects we expect for teachers of vocational subjects  acquiring new inspirational impulses, new pedagogical strategies and competencies. After completing the two week practice abroad we expect for students new working experience from a completely different cultural environment. Extending the possibility to gain professional experience abroad we also expect increased  interest of employers in our graduates and better prospects of our students with foreign companies and enterprises. \r\nIn the long term the project will increase the attractiveness of the school and its graduates, increase the professional employment of the graduates, widen the horizons of teachers and their lifelong learning, strengthen the position of  the school among successful schools.

Most of our pupils are interested in English. The school provides education in a four-year study programme. The added value of studying at our school is emphasizing the necessity of linking theory to practice through training companies in which students can practically verify their knowledge and skills in a simulated foreign business environment. Furthermore, pupils in the 3rd and 4th grade must complete compulsory vocational practice at the agreed workplaces. This is where we are opening the door to identifying our need to deepen the linking of theory to practice, so that we produce not only theoretical experts for the labour market but especially experienced and practically trained experts with active communication in the English language. In 2017, for the first time in the history of the school, we were able to implement compulsory vocational experience in companies abroad through Erasmus +, KA1 Mobility of VET Learners and Staff. This activity was a great success not only among the 15 pupils who attended it, but also among other pupils and teachers. Moreover, the school has also been successful distinguishing itself from other schools, making it more attractive. Therefore, we decided to continue this activity by submitting another application under this program. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly seen in improving the starting position of future graduates of the secondary school of business in the national and European labour market.\r\nThe aim of this project is to increase the employability of our pupils in the labour market through the realization of foreign vocational mobility which will increase the professional skills and competencies of the pupils. The subject of the project is the realization of foreign mobilities, which will take place in the Czech Republic (specifically in Ostrava) and in England (specifically in London) for a duration of 2 weeks - 10 working days, 14 days together with a journey and a weekend.  It will be attended by 26 pupils together. Through our collaboration with the ADC College in England, 12 of our pupils will be located in companies operating in the Business administration area. As part of mobility in the Czech Republic, pupils will be placed in the following companies: Account Professional, Wincott People, Yakovidis - Klega Partners. The project\u00b4s realization will be supervised by the project team composed of \u2013 a project manager, project coordinator, financial manager, to ensure its quality. By completing foreign mobilities, pupils will get an overview of the functioning of the labour market in England and the Czech Republic, entrepreneurship opportunities, rights and obligations of entrepreneurs, principles of the real estate business, information about career growth opportunities and youth employment promotion, social policy and the social system in England, the functioning and operating conditions, as well as of the charitable organization financing system, a brief overview of the subsidy policy, learn about English language teaching methods, about the importance of marketing whether in personal life or in a working business environment. The greatest benefit of the project at the pupils' personal level will be the acquisition of new experience and professional skills, including the improvement of language competencies. The project will provide them with a unique life experience and will motivate them to further professional, linguistic and personal growth. They will learn how it works in a foreign company, they will get acquainted with the duty to go to work, to have a fixed working time, to work in a multi-ethnic group, to be responsible and to realize the importance of work they have to do. The realization of the project also benefits school. The importance of vocational practice in the international environment is mainly reflected in the improvement of the starting position of future graduates of the business school in the national and European labour market. The London internship increased, according to the response of the Day of Open Door in December 2017, the attractiveness of vocational training and the interest in getting high-quality vocational and communication competencies at our school. Last but not least, the image of school has improved, as well as the motivation of pupils from lower grades to acquire vocational and linlinguistic competencies in order to take part in a similar internship.
