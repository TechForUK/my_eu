Students require professional training in modern diagnostic equipment, as most modern cars are equipped with management systems using sensors and actuators. Therefore, in order to be able to solve any malfunctions they must be familiar with the waveforms of each sensor and actuator using the appropriate diagnostic equipment, so their training regarding the appropriate equipment i.e. picoscope, is essential. The Clydebank Campus was chosen as it has the necessary equipment and qualified staff. Arrangements have been made for students to visit the Nissan manufacturers\u2019 car plan. They will also be visiting the Nissan academy, to learn about the different ways a manufacturer can solve any official dealers\u2019 problem, in any location worldwide. The above visits are of vital importance to the students as they do not have such facilities in their home country, and for many of them this will prove to be the experience of a life time. The visiting students will be attending the college classes, both theoretical and workshop. They will become better acquainted and experience at first hand the teaching and learning methods together with the opportunity to enhance the cultural experience.  \r\nFLOW No 2: High Tech in Mechanical Engineering Systems - wisamar Bildungsgesellschaft gemeinnuetzige GmbH Germany\r\nHigh Technology (HT) Mechanical Engineering systems are becoming increasingly important in the modern industry. It is therefore a must for professionals at all levels to acquire the necessary knowledge on the use and the maintenance of such systems. \r\nHigh technology intelligent systems are very common in most engineering applications and the need for our students to study and get familiar with this type of technology is very important.  Our students need to realize that by getting familiar with this HT they will strengthen their position in the market. Visiting sites which use this HT will give them the opportunity to see firsthand and find out the advantages in using it. They will get familiar with these HT and they will be able to correlate practice and theory. \r\nThe proposed programme will involve students from the specialization of engineering.\r\nFLOW No 3: Internship in Automobile Mechanics and Maintenance -  Wisamar Bildungsgesellschaft gemeinn\u00fctzige GmbH Leipzig\r\nThe participating students have been selected as they are currently attending the motor vehicle course at school. Students require professional training in modern technology as also in electric drive vehicle. \r\nThe group will comprise of 2 teachers and 18 students from practical Practical section and apprenticeship program also, both from the Motor Vehicle department. The training would be a combination of practical training and study visits. The practical training would take place in two training centers \u2013 one offers workshops by a Porsche trainer and at Porsche vehicles/parts, the other one is run by the Leipzig Public Transport Company. Students will also visit the BMW production facilities where they could see the production of different BMW series, the \u201cnormal\u201d ones and/or the i-series. The programme will have the objective to improve the participants\u2019 knowledge and practical skills like car mechanics, hydraulics, pneumatics and electro mechanics as well as body work.  \r\nFLOW No 4: LPG AND CNG GAS CONVERSION SYSTEMS - Gas Italy \r\nAccording the new government low and the new curriculum in Technical Schools about the cars that they can use also gas for engine fuel, new needs are appeared.  \r\nThose new needs we called to manage them as automotive engineer teachers. We have to produce the new mechanics for installing, servicing and repair the system on cars that they gone use gas (LPG, CNG).\r\nIt is therefore a must for professional at all levels acquire the necessary knowledge on the use and the maintenance of such systems.\r\nThe participating theaters have been selected to attend the program and to be train in Gas Italy one of the largest companies deals with gas.\r\nThe visiting teachers have to be attend both theoretically and practical classes so to became ready for training students and install, service, repair and reteach the holly item.\r\nFLOW No 5: The main goal of the suggested program is to get training in handling and working with three special refrigeration liquids and gases. These are the Ammonia, Hydro carbon and CO2. These three are needed special training since their handling is much different than the other refrigerant liquids and gases known as Freon. In Cyprus there is not even one Training Center to provide this training. At the end of the day the participants will certified with City and Guilds and Polar Pump certification.", "http://www.polarpumps.co.uk/", null, "erasmus_2017-1-CY01-KA116-026632_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DN11"}
