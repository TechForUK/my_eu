The first one consists of the mandatory theoretical knowledge of the master with a choice of elective study track: Adult-Geriatric or Paediatric-Neonatal specialisation. The second semester focuses on clinical training and an elective study track (Adult, Pediatrics, Geriatrics and Crisis Resource Management) and the third one on further specialization on nursing care (Oncologic, Transplant, Perioperative, Cardiologic, Nutritional and Respiratory) culminating with the completion of a Master Thesis. All courses will be taught in English, but throughout the mobility periods, students may also follow language courses in Portuguese and Spanish. The EMECC NURSING Master will prepare clinician nurses to provide advanced nursing care within acute care services. To ensure student preparedness and employability, the Master will grant them a solid theoretical background, evidence-based training and clinical hands-on internships, using the most advanced clinical techniques. All academic and experiential training modules have been specifically designed to fulfil the needs of intensive care units, as assessed by the participating nursing schools and collaborating hospitals.The students who successfully complete the EMECC NURSING training programme shall receive an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Emergency and Critical Care Nursing by all the four Consortium universities, with its equivalence in the national languages.", "http://www.napier.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_586557-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA1-JMD-MOB_3"], [2018, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", 352527.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.napier.ac.uk", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-046758_coordinator"], [2014, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", 315565.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.napier.ac.uk", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA103-000111_coordinator"], [2017, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", 260766.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.napier.ac.uk", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA103-035696_coordinator"], [2018, "Speculative Design \u2013 Educational Resource Toolkit", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", 234110.0, 5, 6, "The main aim of this project is to strengthen speculative design education by collecting and exchanging existing knowledge and experience whilst developing new methods in this emerging design field. By creating a transnational strategic partnership, built on different contexts and experiences across Europe, it will create a framework for the exchange of ideas and approaches and develop a Toolkit of resources for speculative design education. In the context of rapidly shifting social, technological, media and economic conditions an increasing number of designers are developing new approaches to design. These \u201cnew designers\u201d act on the borders of traditionally defined disciplines, blurring the distinctions between them. In their research, these new designers engage with diverse fields of science, primarily computer sciences and engineering, sociology, psychology, architecture, biotechnology, nanotechnology, etc., with the goal of critically reflecting on the development and role of technology in society. \r\nSpeculative design is the most significant example of these new design practices focused on \u201cproblem finding\u201d rather than \u201cproblem solving\u201d. It is a discursive practice, based on critical thinking and dialogue, which questions the practice of design. However, a speculative design approach takes critical practice one step further; towards new future imaginaries or alternative possible trajectories. Through a range of speculative methods, designers re-think alternative products, systems and worlds. Through its imagination and radical approach, speculative design forces one to think \u2013 raises awareness, provokes action, initiates discussions and perhaps even offers some alternatives that are essential for the world of today, and more importantly, the world of tomorrow.\r\nMain target audiences are educational institutions and PhD and master students (also bachelor) which are interested in investigating relationships between people, society and technology. However, speculative practice has a broader reach and influence. Namely, speculative design could be seen as a tool for society related practices which are important in raising awareness, initiating discussions but also taking actions, outside exclusively design context. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in speculative approaches within the wider design community that reveals the need for new designers in the industrial sector, i.e., in companies employing designers to consider scenarios for future trends and research into the adoption of emerging technologies.\r\nAlthough there are existing speculative design educational programs, regular educational practice is often slow to embrace new approaches and methodologies. There is a need for stronger institutional collaboration in strengthening these novel design educational approaches outside the regular curriculum (educational process). Multinational, multi-partner collaboration offers great context for developing, testing and disseminating novel educational content. In the regular teaching process, there is not often a chance to test new ideas and tools within an intensive context. From educational practice we experience an urgent need for a collection of resources related to this approach, accompanied by further reflective analysis and development. These resources, systematically structured and disseminated, could offer students new design skills for the 21st century, reflexive and critical toward their own practice in order to go beyond the limits of design definitions and to re-think the role of design and designers in today's society.\r\nThe main objectives of this project are:\r\n- to collect, exchange, reflect upon, develop and advance educational practice in the area of speculative design;\r\n- to create new (and strengthen existing) partnerships in the field of speculative design education with particular emphasis on forging interactions between designers and experts from other related disciplines;\r\n- to support and consolidate speculative design education;\r\n- to promote speculative design as educational approach and mode of critical thinking (to academic and broader audience outside design context).\r\nProject will organise these three events:\r\n- open discussion with experts (multiplier event);\r\n- international students workshop (multiplier event);\r\n- symposium (multiplier event with exhibition and final dissemination workshop).\r\nProject is going to produce three outcomes:\r\n- State of the Speculative Design Study: study will describe the current landscape of speculative design and related design practices at the European level - collection of best practices and case-studies;\r\n- Speculative Design Textbook: textbook for students but also practitioners, based on the Outcome 1 and reflections/evaluations from the discussion and the workshop.\r\n- Speculative Design Open Toolkit: open access online repository based on the Outcome 1 and 2 \u2014 to be freely used and maintained by the speculative design communities and networks.", "http://www.napier.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-HR01-KA203-047427_4"], [2017, "Development of competencies and Modules to Enhance Advanced Practice across Europe for Health and Social Care Management Masters Students", "EDINBURGH NAPIER UNIVERSITY", 227367.0, 4, 4, "Project Rationale:\r\nDOCMAN will focus on improving pedagogy specifically around blended education to prepare Health and Social Care managers for the challenges of integration, inclusion and innovation. Most European governments have cut or frozen welfare spending as the costs of healthcare continue to rise.  Populations are aging often due to advances in healthcare which are often costly, however spending the most does not always guarantee the best outcomes.  Demands to deliver a high quality, cost effective service have never been higher and innovation and shared learning is one the key mechanisms to deliver this.  Models of care, integration of health and social care services and cost sharing are some of the key areas that European wide collaborative learning could be of great benefit.  However the focus of many current programmes for this have an inward focus \u2013 on areas such as human resource management, quality and clinical governance.  While there is clearly an importance to educate around these, needs have changed and the benefits and requirements to look outward to different and new innovative practices, needs to be developed.\r\n\r\nThe project is based on findings from research in partner universities and from a previous EU funded project entitled CareMan LLP which identified gaps in the provision of education for health and social care managers. The gap was apparent on two levels; firstly in the competencies and capabilities required due to the changes in most health and social care provisions, secondly for the platforms and mechanisms to realise the clear benefits of collaborative learning across the EU.  \r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n# DOCMAN will, through a structured research programme in four EU countries provide a comprehensive educational needs analysis which will look at the emerging educational needs in this sector. This will provide the data to develop a competency framework focused around the knowledge and skills which will form the basis of the three pilot modules.   These actions will be enhance the quality and relevance of student knowledge and skills to face the new challenges of health and social care management within the EU.    There will be three modules developed around these competencies focused on the needs of the student group \u2013 who are existing or potential leaders in health and social care.    These actions will be enhance the quality and relevance of student knowledge and skills to face the new challenges of health and social care management within the EU. After the pilot modules these will be developed into open educational resources which\u2013 non participants can also use to evidence their development around this important area.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants; \r\nHealth and Social Care Masters students \r\nPilot: Up to 120 students from partner universities\r\nDOCMAN international conference and seminars: 30 students from other EU universities\r\n\r\nLecturers or teachers in HEI;\r\nDevelopment of and delivery three modules and open access educational resources: up to 12 lecturing staff \r\nDOCMAN international conference and seminars: 40-80 academic staff and other interested stakeholder from EU Higher Education community. \r\n\r\nHealth and Social Care Managers\r\nParticipation in focus groups and interviews exploring educational needs:  Up to 50 \r\nDOCMAN international conference and seminars: 50-100 health and social care managers or representatives from these organisations. \r\n\r\nActivities and Methodology:  An intensive scoping stage including primary research with a targeted group health and social care managers followed by desk based research will inform the development of an interactive competency framework. The next stage will be the development of 3 pilot course to develop the skills and knowledge to deliver the relevant competencies needed in this sector.  At end these will then be developed into open access educational resources linked to the competency framework and continue to be an active resource for students, educators and health and social care managers. The project will be underpinned by a robust quality assurance protocol.  There will be intensive evaluation of all the modules focused on their effectiveness to allow improvements to be made to the open educational resources at the end to maximise impact.  \r\n\r\nThe project has an ambitious dissemination plan to ensure the outputs of the project reach our target audience.

In Europe, approximately 20% of the young generation is not equipped with the necessary basic skills in literacy, mathematics, science and technology. \r\n\r\nConcerns about low student performance in basic skills, as revealed by international surveys, led to the adoption in 2009 of an EU-wide benchmark which states that 'by 2020 the share of 15-year-olds with insufficient abilities in reading, mathematics and science should be less than 15 %'. In order to achieve the benchmark target by 2020, we must jointly identify obstacles and problem areas on the one hand and effective approaches on the other.\r\n\r\nMany researchers conclude that students' low or declining interest in science is partly due to its presentation as a collection of detached, de-contextualised and value-free facts that are not connected to students' own experiences (Aikenhead, 2005).\r\n\r\nIn the light of above, the innovative formal and informal science education plays a key role to raise both young girls' and boys' awareness of the different aspects encompassing science and technology in today\u2019s society and to enhance young people to pursue careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nSMART KIDS is one of the initiatives to contribute in addressing this complex issue through developing a complementary educational module for pupils between 10 and 14 years that will apply a learner-centred approach. This participative learning method will enable students to engage them toward science, and, above all to interiorise their competences of several scientific subjects, to develop thinking skills and to boost their creativity, inquiry, problem solving and other transversal skills.\r\n\r\nThis SMART KIDS educational module will be based on the concept of Smart City and its multidisciplinary perspective that favours the entrepreneurship and stimulates the development of scientific subjects such as TIC, physical, mathematics, engineering and architecture. Therefore, SMART KIDS will introduce students to the concepts of science, technology and engineering with a focus on urban planning and sustainability. It will include hands-on activities on energy, urban infrastructure, transportation systems and wireless communications topics.

However, female participation in the labour market is consistently low across the region. In order to develop a skilled STEM workforce to meet industrial demands, it is necessary to increase and engage the female population by overcoming perceived and/or realised barriers to entry.  A key aspect of achieving this involves empowering employers and educators to make positive changes to their workplace environments and practices with a view to creating a more inclusive and attractive sector.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the ENGENDER project is to identify the factors that distinguish between small to medium sized STEM employers that have embraced equality and diversity in the workplace and those who have not. Specifically, the project aims to identify the interventional strategies that have proven to be most effective for improving gender equality in organisations at various stages of engagement. In order to achieve this, we propose the development of a Self-Assessment Toolkit and best practice guides for increasing gender equality engagement that will lead to the development and delivery of a bespoke accredited blended learning training programme.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to positively impact on the flow of female recruits into (and through) the STEM sector pipeline, with a focus on SMEs, and to support unbiased recruitment and retention processes to be mainstreamed into employment and education sectors.  It also seeks to provide educational resources for participants to improve their awareness and understandings of key issues through engagement in relevant, specific accredited programmes with currency within the sector. This approach is proposed in response to an established need for low or no cost flexible educational content.\r\n\r\nIn order to address these key issues the project delivers four key outputs:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Publication of Gender Equality Research and Associated Best Practice Guides\r\n\u2022 Online Self-Assessment Gender Equality Diagnostic Toolkit\r\n\u2022 Blended Learning Training Programme\r\n\u2022 Blended Learning and Dissemination Web Platform\r\n\r\nApplication of these outputs is anticipated to lead to the realisation of the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. To improve stakeholder knowledge and awareness of gender equality issues within the STEM sector by engaging a minimum of 200 unique employer and educator participants in a bespoke training programme. \r\n2. To engage a minimum of 2000 stakeholders in web based activity over the lifespan of the project including website access, social media interactions, engagement with best practice guides and other project outputs.\r\n3. To support a minimum of 60 SME employers (20 per country) in using the Gender Equality Self-Assessment Diagnostic Toolkit to assess their progress with respect to recruitment, retention and advancement policies and practice, and produce a bespoke assessment report that is tailored to their individual needs.\r\n4. To increase the average number of females recruited by participating employers by 10% (relative to baseline) by the end of the project.\r\n\r\nThe project partners include City of Glasgow College (Scotland), VHTO (Netherlands), Miguel Altuna Instituta (Spain) and EQUATE Scotland (Scotland). All project partners were chosen in response to a demonstrated track record of promoting gender equality within the STEM and associated sectors as well as experience of working in large externally funded collaborative projects.\r\n\r\nParticipants are primarily drawn from the employer networks of participating organisations although additional employers will be engaged by the project team throughout the lifespan of the project. Additional participants include educators, policy makers, employer representatives, third sector and charitable workers and young people.

Exactly this gap was addressed by Clustering Creativity project.\r\nIn order to cope with the lack of synergy between HEIs, online marketing professionals and students as future creators of new media products, a need to strengthen interaction between academia, business and online marketing professionals was identified by the consortium of 7 partners: 5 universities from Lithuania, Latvia, Germany, Croatia, and the UK joined by online marketing and private training companies.\r\nThe aim of Clustering Creativity project was to stimulate synergy among universities, internet marketing companies and students in order to empower Cultural and Creative Industries for the creation of jobs in new media market. To reach the aim, the project pursued 4 objectives all of which were successfully met. Obj #1 was aiming to create international new media community integrating students, online media companies and educators. A Creator Hub platform with over 1000 registered users from 32 countries confirms that consortium has managed to grow this international community beyond the borders of the EU. Obj #2 was aiming to strengthen the skills of students which was achieved by developing hands-on innovative learning methodology and engaging learning materials. Students from all the participating countries had an opportunity to propose their ideas for 8 different challenges, created by real operating businesses, and to be evaluated by and negotiated with the decision makers in these companies, taking the practical part of this project as close to real business situations as possible. Obj #3 aimed at developing an internet platform as a tool for interaction of new media community. The platform offers its visitors 3 blocks of topics (fundamentals; strategy; tools and implementation) that include video, slides and additional material about selected topics in digital media and marketing. Obj #4 aimed to create conditions for acquiring labour market related knowledge and skills during the studies. During the training activities linkages and common understanding among digital business professionals and academia have been created by project partners. Short-term joint staff training event, carried out in the frames of Clustering Creativity, has highly contributed to achieving project's objectives through increased competencies of the authors who developed the training module. Better awareness on labour market needs in digital marketing and new ideas on strategies how to involve students, teachers and businesses as well as build the community around / through clustering creativity platform were among other benefits of the short-term joint staff training.\r\nThe key outputs of Clustering Creativity are a training module and Creator Hub available at www.clusteringcreativity.com and social media.

A central purpose of the foundation is the promotion of education, information, sensitivity and orientation towards the rights of animals embedded in an ecological world view. In this context the protection of animals has to be understood as having a social, emotional , cultural and ethical value as well as presenting challenges in respect of economic  issues and the health of consumers. This idea has been promoted by ERNA\u2019s different activities including legislative means, radio features, the promotion of research, pilot projects in continuous education and the development of teaching materials and books for students. In 2011 the first workshop and seminar for the teaching of teachers and other teaching staff concerning animal protection in class had been organized, together with a work group of the local authorities for school education in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Bildung, Jugend und Wissenschaft. As a consequence of this the project \u201cTIKA\u201d had been started together with the Chamber of Veterinaries in Berlin. TIKA is dedicated for the teaching of teachers in Berlin Schools concerning animal protection and correct care of house animals. For some years EGS has been active in a working group at European level preparing programmatic European activities like the first Conference on Animal Education, which took place in Brussels in 2010. EGS initiated a pilot project at European level called Walk-The- Dog, with a teacher work book and teaching material for pupils that has been  distributed all over Germany and to some other European countries.  A large number of schools throughout Europe are working with the teaching material that has been translated into English and Greek. The EGS board of directors decided in 2013 to participate in the ERASMUs+ KA 1 program in order to strengthen intercultural training and quality in professional education to bring about holistic competence and improved animal welfare in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready in 2010 EGS started  the preparation of european projects in professional education because it is a matter of fact that there is a big need for ecological education especially in professions that deal with veterinary and agricultural tasks. EGS started with a pilot study and decided to focus on the professional education of veterinary nurses in Europe. The aim is to improve and to stress animal rights and ensure correct treatment of animals in professional education. In the framework of KA 1, individual Mobilities, ERASMUS+, EGS initiated a cooperation of all relevant institutions in Berlin that deal with dual education of vet nurses in Berlin on a regional level, called \u201cBerlin Consortium Vet Nurse Europe\u201d. This cooperation is built between EGS, Chamber of Veterinaries in Berlin and the professional school called OSZ Gesundheitstechnik, educating 3  classes of Vet Nurses every year (approx. 80 vet learners). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protection of animals is one central aim of Erna-Graff- Foundation, an NGO that has been founded  30 years ago. The basis idea of \"Vet Nurse Europe\" is to focus and strenghten the protection of animals in the world of professional education in veterinary professions. Following to this the promotion of an holistic  professional competence  is essential as an integral part of social learning last not least in the client contact with animals and their owners. Prevention, self- organization and the development of an holistic competence in the framework of ecological thoughts should be strenghtened and considered in veterinary professions much more in the near  future. All this can be promoted in cooperation with european partners for individual mobilities, esp. of vet learners. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAims oft he project:The project will  improve the professional competence of participants. It will enable and promote individual mobility of vet learners in order to make them profit of learning chances to stay in a foreign country. Furthermore professional education should be improved in regard of ECVET. The systems of professional education should be more transparent and comparable. This is essential for the aims of Kopenhagen.  There is something basically new that gives an innovative approach to this project.  The promotion of ERASMUS+ mobilities will enable a  cooperation between dual  institutions in Germany and university/ colleges in Great Britain in the field of vet nurse education.

This potential includes the ability of ENM to induce damage at the cellular, tissue, or organism levels by interacting with cellular structures leading to impairment of key cellular functions. These adverse effects may be mediated by ENM-induced alterations in gene expression and translation, but may involve also epigenetic transformation of genetic functions. We believe that it will be possible to create a set of biomarkers of ENM toxicity that are relevant in assessing and predicting the safety and toxicity of ENM across species. The ENM-organism interaction is complex and depends, not simply on the composition of ENM core, but particularly on its physico-chemical properties. In fact, important physico-chemical properties are largely governed by their surface properties. All of these factors determine the binding of different biomolecules on the surface of the ENM, the formation of a corona around the ENM core. Thus, any positive or negative biological effect of ENM in organisms may be dynamically modulated by the bio-molecule corona associated with or substituted into the ENM surface rather than the ENM on its own. The bio-molecule corona of seemingly identical ENM cores may undergo dynamic changes during their passage through different biological compartments; in other words, their biological effects are governed by this complex surface chemistry. We propose that understanding the fundamental characteristics of ENM underpinning their biological effects will provide a sound foundation with which to classify ENM according to their safety.

This unique combination is expected to bring solutions for high-density cities with the design of these systems being resilient, scalable, and reconfigurable. Today, academic research and industrial applications in the area of Smart Cities and communities seek to optimize existing city infrastructure, networks, and urban behavior through the deployment and utilization of different approaches. Cities and communities that employ optimization techniques have reported improvements in energy efficiency, water use, public safety, road congestion, and many other areas. However, optimization has its limits. Research and investments in new urban systems are fundamentally critical because optimization will have little effect for rapidly urbanizing cities which experience around the clock congestion.

Over the past 5 years the economic recession, the changing nature of employment and cutbacks in government spending, including welfare reform, have combine to make the next few years particularly challenging for Deaf people and those organisations that seek to improve their employability. There is a direct link between early education, attainment of professional and/or educational qualifications, advancement into the labour market and social inclusion. Apart from financial autonomy, work and paid employment serves to develop a sense of belonging with positive mental health benefits and identification with the wider community (National Disability Authority, 2005). However, Deaf people in Ireland, as well as throughout the world, continue to face barriers in education, employment and access to services such in healthcare, legal and social welfare settings. In a report on poverty in the Deaf community, Conama and Grehan (2001) stated that Deaf people experience higher rates of poverty, social exclusion and employment. Factors such leaving school with no examination nor qualifications, inadequate support for Irish Sign Language has resulted in a worrying picture and 80% of Deaf adults have literacy problems compared to 25% of the population as a whole. (Irish Deaf Society, 2007). Research and data on unemployment is under reported and inaccurate. \u201cDeafness and hearing loss\u201d is often used to report data, and sign language users who are Deaf is under-researched.  The World Federation of the Deaf also reports that figures on (un)employment are inaccurate and difficult to quantify (Hauland, H  & C. Allen, (2009), Deaf People and Human Rights, WFD).THE CONSORTIUMThe DESIGNS project aims to bring together 7 partners from 4 EU countries who are renowned experts in the fields of Education and Training, Employment, Sign Language Interpreting and Deaf Community Advocacy. The overall aim of the project is to create VET and CPD training resources and exchange best practices across Europe to facilitate greater participation of Deaf sign language users in employment.

The company is a specialist in EU project management and HR and employment and has worked with the Deaf community for several years. DESIGNS builds on the a former project SIGNALL which developed practical training resources for employers to increase their awareness of the Deaf community, sign language  and working in interpreted settings.THE SOLUTIONThe solution to increase access to employment and sustain employment is to increase the awareness of Deaf culture and sign language to employers where barriers and obstacles are created from poor communication and access policies.The solutions can be achieved by:- Creating a training module for Deaf job seeking graduates from higher education who are reported to be underemployed and who have a lower  propensity to get a job;- Creating a training module for employers to increase their awareness of deaf job applicants and job candidates to so that Deaf job applicants have a better chance in succeeding in employment;- Creating a training module for sign language interpreters as part of their continuous professional development to understand the nature of interpreting in employment (pre-employment/during employment) settings.

Bearing in mind that integration is a two-way process, the progressively increasing multicultural character of EU societies demonstrates the need to introduce intercultural education programmes that recognise and effectively support diversity, promote mutual acceptance and respect, while combatting racism and xenophobia. \r\nAgainst this backdrop, supporting the efforts of EU member states to help integrate migrants and refugees into Europe's education systems and ensure their skills development is an urgent and demanding task. Its success is dependent on the educators and teachers, who should be appropriately trained to have a deep understanding of basic concepts of culture and intercultural communication, as well as the historic and contemporary international context. This would enable them to develop an inclusive curriculum and integrate intercultural citizenship education so that they can foster interculturalism and avoid archaic educational practices that cultivate monoculture, othering and stigmatisation. \r\nTo achieve this, as well as the wider challenge of migrants' cultural integration, this project will design a programme for adult educators working with migrants. For this purpose, the project partners will: a) investigate the status quo regarding migrant integration policies, existing programmes and training structures on intercultural training for migrants and educators in partner countries; b) compare and analyse the results of this investigation to develop a needs analysis for intercultural education of trainers; c) develop an internationally competitive modularised training curriculum with qualification standards specialised for Adult Education (EQF Level 5); d) produce a handbook for trainers, which will include learning outcomes, a theoretical framework of basic concepts and the training package itself which will include practical exercises and, where possible, case studies. \r\nAt the beginning of the project , a database of stakeholders in every partner's country will be created which will include actors related to the project aim; experts in AE and intercultural education, migration centres providing training, other interested parties etc.\r\nThe main activities of this project are:\r\nResearch on intercultural education; Partners will collect data on existing training programmes designed for migrants and their cultural integration and will point out the needs for updates or the development of new material.\r\nCurriculum development; A Curriculum on intercultural education and training for Adult educators will be developed based on O1 and O2 results.\r\nDevelopment of training materials; The objective is to elaborate a set of sample training materials organised in modules and divided into topics\r\nDevelopment of a MOOC, where the training materials will be uploaded and adapted.\r\nImplementation of a JSTE; Through the JSTE the partners will test the formerly developed curriculum and training materials, will provide feedback on activities and make eventual changes before the final output.\r\nA Training guide and a course syllabus with final material and useful information and tips will be made available to Adult educators and all interested parties.\r\nMonitoring, evaluation and dissemination; Valorisation activities aim to ensure the widest possible dissemination of objectives, the work and outputs of the project.\r\n\r\nDuring the project, the partners will raise awareness of the use of intercultural training techniques in adult education. The project will therefore have a direct impact not only on adult educators and staff involved in the project, but also on the wider target group of adult educators and newly arrived migrants receiving intercultural training focused on the host countries. The integrative nature and the professional relevance of the materials and methodology will also have an impact on the motivation of newly arrived migrants to learn about the culture, customs and everyday life in their host countries.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the project in all its forms will be disseminated and exploited with a view to maximizing their value and impact. The feedback provided by end-users will ensure that the results will be relevant to target groups and will therefore encourage their use. The developed training programme  can be easily adapted and tailored to changing needs. The curriculum can also be used as a teaching and learning aid for other institutions as it focuses on certain topics which can be re\u2212organized according to the needs of different contexts. The course could also be transferable to other educational sectors and that guarantees the sustainability of project results and the project network.", "http://www.hw.ac.uk", "HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA204-047987_coordinator"], [2016, "MOVING Languages - Mobile Virtual Learning for Languages", "HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY", 155725.0, 6, 6, "The migration in the EU is recently rapidly growing, especially in light of the troubled political situation in the Middle East and Asia. Thus it is of extreme importance to provide additional tools to enhance the integration of the immigrants and refugees arriving in Europe. Language learning is one of the key priorities of successful integration, and mobile applications are an effective educational source that can be specifically targeted at the immigrants, as a large percent of them are digitally literate and are looking for new opportunities in their new countries online.In the frames of the project, we deliver a gamified language-learning solution that will help the refugees/immigrants learn the local language and familiarize themselves with the new concepts in their new countries. This mobile application will specifically be targeted at the immigrants in the European countries and will be available for download on the application markets free of charge.Using the smartphone applications created within this project will give them a head start in learning the native language of the country while waiting for their decisions from immigration or after the residence permit has been granted. These applications will also be useful for any other immigrants who have already been living and working in their new home country for some time. The application will be available in 6 target language versions (English, Spanish, Italian, German, Swedish and Finnish) and will have at least 3 support languages each - that would be the languages most widely spoken by the immigrants in each of the partner countries.The language content of the mobile applications created in this project will be covering the topics that are essential during the first steps of living in the new country and contain 2000-2500 vocabulary items illustrated for easy concept recognition. The vocabulary in this application will also contain the topics with selected country-specific concepts not present in other partner countries. As the target group is refugees (and migrants) and as the stake holders are working in the areas of immigration and migrant associations, the project app should be very easy to disseminate to these stakeholders as a free basic language course using a lot of professional images. The expected impact will be large in all the project partner countries. The impact will be noted regionally, nationally and European-wide.

The trips open up new horizons for the participants. They learn  about new educational possibilities and what they can apply for after they finish their diploma courses, discover new vocational routes and ways to set up small companies.The student gains contextual awareness through visits to cultural institutions and not least, interact with other students in Europe through visits to different schools.Another important part of the study trips is the connection that students and teachers make with other professionals working within their chosen areas of study.The project is in step with the aims of the Icelandic governments\u2018s aims to promote the possibility for those who haven\u2018t finished their studies (about 33% of people in work)  of further study and realizing their dreams of bettering their position in the work force.\r\nThe project is also instrumental in revitalising and encouraging teachers to broaden their own horizons in teaching and as professionals in their different fields.\r\n\r\nThe three study trips will address the need to expand all students views and experiences by introducing them to the European education and employment system of further education and possible routes of study. It is expected that the trip will broaden their views on their potential options for work or further studies in their chosen fields as well as inspire them in their studies after their return to Iceland to finish their diploma courses.The three mobilities will take place during the spring term 2017 and are fully evaluated into the participating students\u00b4 education in RSVA to the amount of 5-6 ETCS.

Omnia is for instance starting co-operation in metal field with a new German partner college, security field co-operation with a new Danish college and  going on IT-field co-operation with a new Irish language school after this spring's piloting mobilities there. We also sent first students to Malta and Mallorca via our new partner institutions this year and are looking forward to hear students' experiences in these new areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are exclunding Hungary from our present partner countries in this project, because in two years no student or staff member has applied there. Omnia's biggest partners will continue co-operating with Omnia: they are European multi-field co-operation colleges, with whom we make reciprocal co-operation. Omnian has most of its partner organisations and colleges in Germany. In this application there are ten German institutes. Co-operation with them is well-working and flexible and Omnia's students and experts  consider the country interesting. That is the reason for a big number of applied grants to Germany in this application. We apply also grants for two ten-student-groups to Germany and this fact adds also the number of applied mobilities to Germany.\r\n\r\nOmnia is also co-operating to some scale directly with smaller European companies. Some vocational fields (social and health care) have most of their partners without PIC. We will add these partners during the project period in the Mobility Tool-platform. \r\n\r\nIn this application Omnia applies also 8 grants for long;  5-6 months mobilites for audiovisual communication, tourism, hotel and restaurant field and business and administration fields students. Omnia took part in piloting long mobilities in a project called European Pathway, a Gateway to work and got very good experiences of them. There were no difficulties of recruiting students for these mobilities and we believe that also in future there would be suitable applicants for them.", "http://www.theplacementfactory.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-FI01-KA116-046821_26"], [2017, "2015-FI01-KA109-009203", "The Placement Factory", 206169.0, 18, 32, "Omnia implements the most essential part of its international strategy by coordinating reciprocal student- and expert mobilities. The partner network of Omnia has enlarged by adding Austria and Latvia and new project countries during the last project period. Now our intention is to include even Portugal and Lithuania in this KA1-project. This because we at Omnia, also according to our international strategy, want to offer opportunity for international experiences (mainly in the form of on-the-job learning periods abroad) for possibly many students and from all Omnia vocational fields. In Lithuania we would have two new co-operation fields: logistics and property maintenance and that's why this new partner and country interests us. In Portugal the fields would be hotel, restaurant and travelling and in those fields we have had lack of placements and partners in relation to our applicants from those fields. From the security field Omnia has not either yet had any international activities, because we have now educated this field only for one year at Omnia, but we would find out if any of our existing partners also educates  this field and our objective is to start international co-operation also in this field during this new project period. \r\n\r\nFrom the last projects countries Slovakia will be excluded, because students have not applied there and co-operation was not implemented with the country last year either. Omnia's biggest partners are vocational institutes in Europe, but also a few Chambers of Crafts in Germany are included in this project and they also act as our reciprocal partners, which means that Omnia does not only send students to Germany via them but also receives students from them to practice in Finland in many different fields.\r\n\r\nOmnia has plenty of direct company co-operation in Europe, but because most of co-operation companies abroad act without pic-codes, they are not included in this application. Our intention is to include them later as receiving organizations when implementing the project. \r\n\r\nOmnia's one strategical objective is to offer internationalization opportunities for the whole staff, not only for teachers. That's why Omnia offers possibility to apply expert grants also for administrative personnel, guidance counselors, college nurses, curators, Omnia youth workshop personnel and staff of college canteen personnel. One project objective would also be to use a few of expert grants to reinforce co-operation between Omnia and local Finnish companies, who regularly receive foreign students via Omnia to practice at them. Reinforcing would happen by offering the key persons of those companies an opportunity to make an international mobility period of one week by themselves. \r\n\r\nInternationalization is already built in Omnia Curriculum in the form of one new learning unit called: To be a professional internationally.\r\nStudents can carry out this learning unit by doing an on-the-job training period abroad but also by doing their practicing period at some international company in Finland in case the company language is English.\r\n\r\nMost of the applied grants are single grants, which we coordinate one by one but also try to form pairs or small groups of students to each target country. In this application we apply many group mobilities: for instance a 10 student group in the field of AV-communication to Germany for 12 days, 5 students from social- and health care to Ireland for a month, 5 -student -group in the field of joinery to Estonia for 2 weeks (because our partner has a better CNC-machine than Omnia) and 8 student group from the fields of electricity, plumbing, joinery and house building to the Netherlands for three weeks. We apply grants for accompanying persons to travel with groups, because students in these fields are young and would not dare travel without a safe adult.\r\n\r\nInternational project work, including international mobility periods, will be handled both in the applying phase and during the actual working period of each project, in Omnia's pedagogical development team. There are representatives from Omnia's different divisions in this group. The members of pedagogical development team are working as contact persons between the students and personnel of their own vocational field and management of Omnia and between National project services and International team. With this interaction we try to ensure common interests and lines in different project, development and mobility activities. Good practices will be described in Omnia's pedagogical program and presented in the pedagogical group's meetings. In Omnia's result card numbers of student and expert mobilities will be described and these numbers would be followed and controlled regularly in Omnia's management group and on the level of administration. \r\n\r\nThe number of applied grants is based on numbers of mobilities carried out during the school year 2016 -2017 and on the plans done for next project year.", "http://www.theplacementfactory.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FI01-KA116-034404_2"], [2016, "2015-FI01-Ka109-009203", "The Placement Factory", 170481.0, 16, 26, "The main activities to implement internationalization strategy in Omnia are reciprocal student and expert mobility periods. Omnia\u2019s partner network will be widened by new project countries and organizations: Austria, Latvian and Czech Republic are the new project countries in relation to Omnia Around Europe\u2019s project countries. In addition to these, new partner organizations will become from Scotland and Slovenia. The most important point to implement mobilities is to continue co-operation with known, responsible and trustworthy partner organizations. An important aim is to provide internationalization possibilities evenly to students and experts from possibly many vocational fields from Omnia\u2019s wide international co-operation network. The length of student mobility periods varies from two to twelve weeks and expert mobilities from one to two weeks.  Accompanying person mobilities will be applied for a two-week-group-mobility periods to France. The aim during this college mobility period would be to plan and implement a wooden product under supervision of French and Finnish teachers. In addition to this another group-mobility-period will be applied for a ten-student group for the cooking and baking field students. Two support person mobilites would be applied even to this period. These group-mobility-periods would be done for two different co-operation colleges in France. Omnia has a clear aim to combine internalization strategy to curriculums, develop the studies of internationalization pathway and implement the internationalization strategy. Home college internationalisation will be improved  by developing activities with tutor students for intenational activities. This work will be a strategical aim in Omnia\u2019s international development work in 2016. In connection with it we have started a workgroup working with representants from Omnia\u2019s different vocational divisions, persons from international office and pedagogical heads and some persons from other national vocational sister colleges.( Hyria and Vaasa Vocational College). One aim would be to create a time-bound part of study entity concerning key competencies of lifelong learning, which would be achieved during international mobility periods.

A second general feature is that the teachers' mobilities are getting shorter, e.g. due to the fact that students are no longer as a whole group in on-the-job-learning in companies - this used to be a good moment for the teacher to go on mobility.  Now teaching staff has fuller schedules, and difficulties to find a good moment to go. Both these trends have been taken into account in the lenght of applied mobilities.\r\n\r\nKeuda's international strategy focuses, when it comes to mobility of students and staff, on re-inforcing co-operation with school partners. This focus has been identified especially to allow pedagogical and personal development of staff members. It means in practise that staff members spend some time in the schools observing and participating, take students to the companies and workplaces, observe and guide them, work themselves alongside students, learn about possibilities to obtain learning outcomes in the country and company in question, and get to know the curricula of the partner school, as well as teaching methods and pedagogical thinking behind. All this will first of all improve the staff member's know-how on possibilities and impact of international mobility, it improves them acting as an marketing agent inside Keuda to atract new students to mobility, and of course it will also enhance new thinking to their own teaching and co-operation with working life.\r\n\r\nAnother target for Keuda is to develop skills demonstrations abroad. In some of the sectors this already takes place, however, Keuda needs to make internal benchmarking to collect existing practices and know-how of our staff members, and to build on that.\r\n\r\nThird aim is to keep working on developing international activities also for the key working life partners. In other words, to develop an internal service model for planning, offering and carrying out of \"Working life - Keuda's staff -teams\" mobility periods. The win-win -ideology is to give our key workinglife partner's the change to participate in a wellplanned, thematic, targeted 2-3-day-visit to a country/region/sector/partner they have interest in, and to team them with Keuda's staff member to allow the working life co-operation to develop, and shared ideas for development fo flow during the visit.\r\n\r\nFourth aim is to continue to develop Keuda's practices in organizing mobility. Keuda and VET in Finland are constantly changing, as the big VET reform is changing the ways of providing training in Finland.

This strategy goal will be achieved with own resources of the College and supported by Erasmus+ Mobility project, international project of European Comission as well as by education export project financed by ESR.\r\nErasmus+ mobility periods are regarded as a practical tool for internationalizing the college, working against racism and improving the language skills and life coping skills. These are especially important in our small town, Savonlinna, where there are not many possibilities to meet foreigners and practice language skills in natural situations in winter. In summers the town is an international tourist attraction. Hopefully some of the students stay in this region to improve the international knowledge of the companies. However, most of the students end up in bigger cities, where the international relations are part of everyday life and international know-how is a requirement for employment.\r\nIn SAMIedu we constantly work for equality. In addition to the principle to divide the mobility grants among all fields of vocational education evenly we want to offer exchange periods to students, who haven\u2019t had any previous possibility to travel. Students who get income support are also supported with a 350\u20ac grant of our college. Also students studying in preparatory education are sent with their teacher to a familiarization period abroad. In this project we intend to send more male students by laing more emphasis on marketing and using efficiently the new network partnerships, which have been gained through our previous logistics, forestry, metal and vehicle technology projects. Several foreign student groups of these fields will work in the workshops of SAMIedu college in the school year 2018-2019. We\u2019ll also send students studying competence-based vocational qualifications to exchange periods, e.g. datanomes, masseurs and restaurant cooks. These students are mainy adults with families, that\u2019s why we offer them also short exchange periods of 32 days.\r\n\r\nFurther we are starting co-operation with the apprentices of Savonlinna Works Company. They can get acquainted with the tasks of an assembler in the factories of the partnership network in Europe for 2 months. This co-operation has been planned on the need of the company.\r\nIn this project a large variety of digital equipment is used. Students will report their experiences in the blog www.moprosamiedu.blogsport.fi and they will be mentored in WhatsApp by teachers. In this project we\u2019ll further put effort into developing the coaching and the students will collect video material for marketing of exchange periods and our college. From this material we\u2019ll make augmented reality using Thinglink and 360' cameras.

While the evolution of the mobility of vocational training students in the CAV has reached 10% of the total number of students who finish each year, the mobility of teachers, although improving, does not reach the desired minimums\r\nIt is necessary to give impetus to the mobility of teachers of Vocational Training and above all aimed at the acquisition of competences in innovation projects that are being developed. We consider that a very important part of the technological surveillance that allows to identify referring organizations and good practices, is the use of the projects of mobility directed to the faculty.\r\nIkaslan presents this proposal of mobility addressed to teachers of Vocational Training of the whole CAV, who are working on innovation projects in the centers. In the Innovation projects that are developed, around 200 teachers work part-time in the FP center and half a day in innovation, in the development of those projects that have an average duration of two years.\r\nThe projects that are developed cover a wide range of specialties. Some are projects of technological innovation, others are projects that deal with innovation in management, others with innovation in teacher training and others with the development of Information and Communication Technologies tools. In addition, it is a very important part of the system, the network of entrepreneurs responsible for the creation, by the students, of real companies.\r\nThe main objective of these projects is to reduce as much as possible the time that elapses between an innovation emerges and access to vocational training centers. Teachers working on these projects design the materials and training that teachers will need to catch up in these fields of innovation.\r\nThere are two other very important needs that we want to cover with the development of this project: it is about giving support to the development and creation of other European projects.\r\nProjects for which we organize this proposal:\r\nInternational Management, Sectors of ICT, Sector of Methodologies in Training.

Often, the decision whether or not to offer, or fully engage in modern languages in environments such as ours, appears to relate to adult expectations of the children's capabilities and to staffing resources and confidence rather than to the ability of the children to benefit.  However, our teachers believe learning other languages, by revisiting the basics of language, gives the children the opportunity to revisit concepts which, particularly with our children, may have been missed or poorly understood and, rather than interfering with language development, stimulates its development and an impact can be detected right across the curriculum. The opportunity to practice basic skills in another language makes them seem more adult and sophisticated and, therefore, more acceptable to our children, who may otherwise resent being made to work on what is often seen as infant material; one of the reasons our staff are so passionate about developing their own skills in this area.  Most of our local mainstream schools are already well underway in their exciting journey in implementing effective language programmes in schools.  At Harmeny, we feel that we have a great need to develop our knowledge and skills so that we too can embark on our exciting journey in taking forward the promotion and implementation of Spanish fully in August 2017 in line with our School Improvement Plan.\r\n\r\nHaving met regularly, we have identified that the participants mentioned in this application all have very different experiences/levels of Spanish.  We are all in agreement that by visiting Spain and being fully immersed in a Spanish programme of study and by experiencing the culture first-hand that this would be the most invaluable and memorable way of inspiring our learners back in the classroom.  Furthermore, we believe that we will all be able to share our experiences with the rest of our colleagues at Harmeny in order, not only to motivate them, but also to instill a real enthusiasm for learning Spanish across all areas of the organisation.\r\n\r\nBruner advocates that the most effective way to learn is through active discovery and, as we all support Bruner's theory, we believe that this immersion programme not only embraces the key principles of Curriculum for Excellence, therefore, being given this opportunity as lifelong learners ourselves giving us the opportunity to fully embrace the 1+2 approach in line with Government policy, but will also serve to ensure that the Spanish learning programme we will create and deliver will reflect the seven principles of curriculum design.  Moreover, when teachers themselves receive positive, relevant and meaningful learning experiences, the motivation and knowledge gained from this, greatly helps create engaging experiences and opportunities for our learners.\r\n\r\nThis course encompasses learning Spanish with native speakers, developing a greater cultural awareness and discovering new ways of teaching languages through a variety of media.  It offers invaluable training in the teaching of foreign languages to young learners through observing and participating in modelled activities.  A real incentive of attending this course is the facility to network with other professionals from across Scotland and Spain with whom we can share resources and good practice.  We were also delighted to discover that on completion of this project we will receive a pen-drive containing many tried and tested resources and activities. By having a bank of resources, which can be adapted to suit the interests and needs of all our learners at all levels, this enables teachers to plan exciting lessons to engage all our children in language learning.
