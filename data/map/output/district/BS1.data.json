They will test the e-learning course, modules and content as well as the online portal and give their assessment by interview and questionnaires.Target groups and partnersThe main target groups are pedagogues, cooking personnel, kitchen staff and chefs in kindergartens as well as caterers for kindergartens who need a specific education in sustainability and its aspects in nutrition and food system that they can transfer this knowledge to children and their parents. Another important target group which needs to be addressed are headmasters and personnel manager of kindergartens, decision makers in public administration, universities and higher schools educating (future) teachers, students and parents.The e-learning course and portal \u201cSustainable food in kindergartens\u201d will bring a new and innovative field of skills and competence with a high relevance for the above mentioned target groups. A minimum of 250 persons should be reached in each country by the project activities. For dissemination purpose a European network, formed as a \u201cCommunity of practice for sustainability in kindergartens\u201d with stakeholders from the participating countries, will be installed.

Farm visit as pedagogical methodEducational farm visits provide an alternative and innovative space that enables \u201cinformal and formal learning\u201d to take place alongside the more conventional school learning environment.  Bio-Farms are ideal for teaching. Groups of children and young people can spend the day on farm in practical way. Visits on the farm are interactive workshops. Learning first-hand on a farm about the realities and challenges of food production can be an important formative experience. Farm visits are ideal practical complement to the knowledge acquired in the schools (biology, geography, economics, ecology and environmental protection, sustainability). Teachers and other pedagogues can find in farm life various links to school curricula and experience areas, to open a practical and non-cognitive access to educational subjects and issues. Integration of disadvantaged youthAttending a farm visit brings particular benefits for teachers, who educate pupils with difficulties in mainstream learning systems. Classes including children and youth with special needs (e.g. refugees, children with migrant background, children with developmental disorders, learning disabilities or social problems) get intensive and new experience for the group apart from conventional patterns of learning and competing in classrooms. Visits on organic farms can support teachers in integrating those children and young people.Integration of refugee childrenA special focus in the project will be refugee children and families. Europe has to face the challenge to integrate a lot of refugees in the society. The \u201cLearning place Bio-Farm\u201d has a big potential to offer this group of people new perspectives outside their living in refugee camps. Visiting the countryside offers an inside into the European culture and nutrition behaviour. Therefore farm visits will also address refugee families and adults. And there are a lot of incentives to learn new vocabulary that is connected with the countryside, agriculture and food commodities. Farm workshops can help to minimize language barriers by practical hands on activities. Besides this the organic farming sector is an economically growing branch that needs motivated young people to work in. Job perspectives (as an organic farmer, bakers, butchers, or shop keepers) can be explained during the farm visits not only for young European pupils but as well for refugees.Training of \u201cBio-Farm Guides\u201dNone of the existing training offers are aimed at supporting teachers, farm guides and staff of coordinating agencies. Thus the project intends to develop a comprehensive European training course and portal with various interactive tools and learning materials to educate \u201cBio-Farm Guides\u201d. It will support a professionalization of \u201cBio-Farm Guides\u201d and support them in gaining familiarity with the practicalities and technicalities of hosting farm visits, such as planning and performing the visit in consideration of the health- and safety needs of the age of the visitors. They will gain better knowledge of the needs and possibilities of the schools. They will become familiar with school curriculum, the different subjects and different types of schools and will thereby be able to relate the farm visit directly to the school curriculum and integrate this in the visit. And they will acquire intercultural and social competences for the integration of disadvantage pupils and refugee children.

Access to safe, tap water helps to increase pupils overall water consumption, maintain hydration, and reduce energy intake. In addition, adequate hydration improves cognitive function among children and adolescents, which is important for learning.\r\nIn turn, the project activities will help provide softer outcomes of increased personal development and employability of educators and their pupils, and contribute to EU Sustainable Development Goals, to the Drinking Water Directive and to European strategies to reduce obesity and tooth caries rates in children.\r\n\r\nFor the majority of kindergartens and primary schools, allowing pupils to drink water throughout the day is now commonplace. But to meet the requirements, it takes more than only allowing, it is necessary to implement drinking rituals and active promotion of water drinking in classroom. In secondary schools, water availability is less visible and water may be seen by pupils as a less attractive option than alternative sodas or softdrinks.

All of the five organisations involved in our proposal are highly respected organisations  and include specialists in inspection and certification of organic livestock farms.  Organic management aims to deliver excellent animal welfare and independent annual inspection and certification aims to confirm this and provide a guarantee that animals have a \u2018good life\u2019 that meets the high expectations of consumers who buy organic animal products.  Any failure to deliver on this aspect risks undermining the reputation of organic inspection and certification through the EU.  The problem that we will address is that the legally defined standards for delivering welfare are resourced based e.g. space per animal in housing, type of housing, type of feed, are becoming outdated. Experience and recent scientific knowledge indicates that this approach alone is now insufficient.  A new scientifically informed evaluation of the animals to determine their \u2018welfare outcomes\u2019 is more meaningful in underpinning the inspection process and aiding communication of any deficiencies to farmers in a way that they can understand and act upon.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe use of \u2018welfare outcomes\u2019 is a new and emerging approach that each of the partners has been developing in their own standards and inspection systems.  The time is now right for these pioneering organisations to come together to share experience, evaluate our current work and developed a common and coherent concept.  When this is agreed we will make it into an accessible and easily disseminated training and learning package available to other organisations with the support of an University to support an optimum training approach.  We aim to add this to the widely accepted inspection toolkit that has already been successfully initiated under a previous project by the lead partner organisation GfRS. \r\n\r\nMethodology, project management and quality assurance\r\nOur proposal carefully assigns responsibility and coordinates a stepwise approach to each of these activities as well as ensuring proactive dissemination through multiple platforms including seminars, specialist media and the internet to communication the project outputs and foresees an independent evaluation of the work and impact of the project.\r\nThe work of the partners will be facilitated by Skype meetings, meetings in person and training events.  Our approach to welfare assessment will be piloted and evaluated on farms over the widely different farming systems associated with the diverse geographical locations of the partners and will, therefore, produce robust output that is widely relevant and applicable throughout the whole of the EU.\r\n\r\nImpact and long term benefits\r\nThis work will allow high quality and consistent learning by organic inspectors to improve their performance in and delivery of animal welfare using a harmonised robust approach to assessment.  It will benefit the individuals involved, their organisations, the organic farmers and the wider organic sector that will have access to the high quality \u2018Inspector toolkit\u2019 learning and training materials.

When we switch our focus to the individual, rather than the project, we move away from being fixated on the potential \u2018red herring\u2019 of cinematic release as the ultimate goal.\u2022\tChanging the Language - are film funds perceived as bureaucrats, cr\u00e9atives or facilitators, and does the vocabulary of politics and markets distract from our core aims? Our language and methods must carry the filmmakers\u2019 artistic desire and urgency when we are discussing\tprojects and ambitions.\t\u2022\tBursting the Bubble - are we empowering filmmakers to survive in the \u2018real world\u2019, or creating a dependency trap? Focus must be on enabling talent to take responsibility and reach their own decisions, whilst supporting them to make informed choices about their work and ambition.\u2022\tReinventing the \u2018Microbudget Scheme\u2019 - are such formats inspiring and enabling, or restricting and protecting for first-time filmmakers?

We will collaborate with numerous vocational training centers in Berlin, the participants' training local companies as well as with the Chambers and the unions. Additionally we will improve the \"European competence\" of stakeholders in vocational training and other local institutions through knowledge transfer and will institutionalize this process by integrating these players into our project as project partners.

Most of them can draw on a network of hundreds or more internship companies. They are well connected with the vocational training centers and political institutions  in their respective regions. \r\n\r\nAs soon as the decisive parameters of a mobility flow have been defined together with the local training institution the project is actively promoted to the defined target group. As soon as the participants for a particular flow have been secured the partner organization in the host country is commissioned with carrying out the preparations for the flow. The quality of each flow is ensured by a number of measures, e. g. mid-term reports, evaluation meetings, accompanying visits and/or a preparatory visit. \r\n\r\nThe desired outcome of the stay abroad is always to improve the participants' employability (roughly 10 % of our participants even receive a job offer abroad), improved social integration of participants who are young parents, have a migration background or learning disabilities, improved proficiency in foreign languages as well as personality development. Furthermore, we intend to create excitement for the European Union in general amongst satisfied participants! All of them can be instrumental in internationalizing their educational institutions.

Of great benefit also is the experience gained in the context of CEDRE.S first presented for Leonardo 2013. This allowed us to develop programmes specifically for a post-student public, coming out higher education, not a priority group in our previous programmes. It has also inspired the title given to this 2014 project, which seems to fit our target group.\r\nWhilst CEDRE.S is clearly structured in terms of phases and apprenticeship units, its overriding purpose is to encompass and improve the professional capacities of participants of level V to I, who have left either secondary education, higher education or full-time training of any sort within the past year.

The idea for MobMan TWBL comes from research and the observation that the managing of TWBL can be a daunting, time-consuming process and that the resources currently available are not as helpful or relevant as they could be, thereby discouraging educational and training institutions from offering this type of experience to their students. \r\n\r\nThere is therefore a gap between what institutions require to manage TWBL and what is currently available in terms of resources. Furthermore, if the numbers undertaking a period of TWBL start to increase, there will be an even greater need for a mobility management tool that allows for effective and efficient use of time by staff who organise these work-based learning opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe MobMan TWBL project brings together 5 partners from 4 EU member states and aims to fill this gap by producing a user-friendly & adaptable mobility management platform to facilitate the management of TWBL.\r\n\r\nThe platform will be a comprehensive open-source resource for the management of transnational work-based meaning. It will allow for the grouping of all necessary information into one place and production of tailored key documents with ease.\r\n\r\nThere will be an Training Module, allowing users to develop their knowledge of the functionalities of the platform and in particular the interface and the document generator. There will also be an interactive User Guide to support users in the use of the key elements of the platform and enable autonomous use by education and training institutions, career guidance and job centres, associations and private enterprises both independently or a tool within existing TWBL programmes. \r\n\r\nThese resources can be used on individual computers and also via servers for multiple users thereby enhancing transparency, usefulness & accessibility.  They will be open source and freely consultable and downloadable via the MobMan TWBL web-platform and available in the 4 languages of the project.\r\n\r\nThese materials can be tailored according to the needs of specific target groups.  They will empower schools, universities, training establishment and mobility service providers to manage high quality work-based learning with more efficient use of time. The project thus contributes to the mainstream utilisation of innovative resources, work methods and training for trainers and teachers.\r\n\r\nThe MobMan TWBL platform will also provide a pathway for validation of qualifications, learning objectives and learning outcomes. It will be compatible with & complement the already existing tools & methods developed & promoted by the EU, such as Europass CV & ECVET. \r\n\r\nThe platform will be tested by at least 10 organisations and the project partners on a control group of 100 trainees who will undertake a transnational work placement of 3 weeks to 6 months in duration in 100 host companies and also by the project partners through their networks for additional work placements to be managed during the life span of the project. Some of these placements will involve young people who would not typically take part in transnational mobility, including those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. It is expected that MobMan TWBL will feature up to 600 transnational work placements, involving up to 25 educational establishments and VET providers, up to 500 host companies and up to 30 additional interested parties, such as local public administrative bodies.\r\n\r\nThe promotion of work-based learning will therefore be on three levels. Firstly, on the number of training institutions that offer TWBL to their trainees. Secondly, on the number of trainees who undertake a TWBL. Thirdly, this increase in participation will improve labour market relevance of learning provision, also facilitating formal and non-formal learning and their validation. Well-performing education and training systems that include TWBL provide people with the skills required by the job market and the economy, while allowing them to play an active role in society and achieve personal fulfilment. \r\n\r\nThe MobMan TWBL project will help increase the impact of transnational work placements, leading to added value on a trainee's CV and thereby improving employability by helping to develop the skills required by businesses. This in turn may contribute to improving the quality of the labour force and helping to promote economic development within the European Union. \r\n\r\nAnother anticipated long-term benefit is to facilitate stronger partnerships between the educational and business sectors by increasing the involvement and ownership of host companies in the work-based learning process. \r\n\r\nIn the words of American Tom Freston 'Innovation is taking things that already exist and putting them together in a new way.'

It is an important non-formal education experience for participants, and especially for people with fewer opportunities, to promote their social and professional career. At the same time, the labour market is more and more difficult to integrate and it is important for unemployed people to get knowledge about how to access it, how to capitalize their competences and their experiences and how to promote this in front of employers.  Moreover, relying on their experience, the partners of the project notice that a majority of unemployed people going on a mobility project, are not registered at the unemployment office, at they do not get benefits and they do not perceive the added-value of such a registration. Because of this, they do not get any advice and careeer guidance, and they need to be followed by the sending organisations, which can take into consideration their mobility experience and which know them because of the whole pedagogical process they have followed.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the Competences + project is to help participants to mobility projects access to the labour market at their return to continue the pedagogical process they have before departure. This implies to create attractive tools for participants and to promote the added-value of mobility projects towards employers. The partners want thus to build their project on four outputs, all related one to each other, thus created an integrated training and support for mobility participants to access the labour market. What will be innovative will also be the development of a phone application, as it is a very practical way of recording and capitalizing on a mobility project. \r\nThe four outputs will be:\r\n- a study towards employers to analyse deeply which competences they expect the participants to value, promote and develop.\r\n- a phone app to keep track of the mobility experience through photo, story and analysis of the competences, that could then printed into a logbook to promote the project towards employers\r\n- an online training that will collect all the opportunities in each partner country and which will provide training on CV and cover letter writing\r\n- the content for a two-day training, similar to the pre-departure training but done upon return, to analyse the competences acquired, train to job-interview and inform about labour market opportunities, self-entrepreneurship and return to training.\r\nThe innovation is  to propose a whole integrated pathway, from infoday at the beginning to return to employment and to collect the advice and opinions of employers to make sure participants will make the most of their experience to get access to the labour market.\r\nEach output will be prepared by the partners, implemented and tested on 30 beneficiaries which will provide feedbacks and adjustments so that the partners can make sure the outputs fit the needs and expectations of the participants to mobility projetcs. \r\n\r\nThe expected impact is to propose a better integration to the labour market for participants back from a mobility project, who require support to capitalize and evaluate their competences and who need to be trained on how to prepare their return and their future professional projects.", "http://www.euplanet.net", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA204-037278_2"], [2018, "Competence without borders", "EUROPEAN PLACEMENT NETWORK Limited", 233628.0, 10, 11, "The project Competence Without Borders (CWB) results from a cooperation between the counties of Akershus and Oslo.

Choice of the partners reflects level of demand by country; English and Spanish-speaking destinations tend to dominate language-based requests, but other countries are selected as a function of specific sectors.\r\nTo encourage initiative, evaluate results and publish them, we collaborate with centres located throughout the Ile de France region, which in turn embraces 150 organisations, whose vocation it is to assist this public in obtaining employment. The Region itself is also an active partner in the project: its involvement since our foundation, \u201cguarantees\u201d the quality of our services and will help us to enlarge still further our partnership networks to other teaching organizations or local authorities.

The idea for MATCHSI comes from research and the observation that the quality of the information collected from the trainees, the vocational education training providers and host companies, particularly small and medium sized businesses, before transnational work placements and then subsequently shared is not always in sufficient depth or as relevant as it could be. At present, this leads to a significant gap between the expectations and objectives of the different stakeholders involved in the process including hosting and sending organisations.  In short, the needs of trainees and host companies are not always being fully identified or taken into account. This in turn can dramatically reduce the many benefits of this type of mobility experience resulting in disappointment and even disillusionment amongst those involved. The MATCHSI project brings together eight partners from seven EU member states and aims to fill this gap by producing user-friendly and adaptable toolkit to facilitate the identification, the collection and the transmission of all the relevant information. These innovative, up to date resources will be compatible with and complement the already existing tools and methods developed and promoted by the EU, such as Europass CV. They will notably allow more accuracy in the development of the learning objectives in an ECVET perspective.  The toolkit will be tested on a control group of 80 trainees who will undertake a transnational work placement of 3 weeks to 6 months in duration and also by the project partners through their networks for additional work placements to be managed during the life span of the project. A significant number of these placements will involve young people who would not typically take part in transnational mobility, including those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds. Based on the number of placements completed in 2014-2015, it is expected that MATCHSI will feature up to 1,000 transnational work placements, involving up to 50 educational establishments and VET providers, up to 350 host companies and up to 30 additional interested parties, such as local public administrative bodies.We will also undertake in-depth research in each partner country and produce a multi-lingual work-based learning compendium of good practice for transnational work placements. The bringing together of these resources from seven European countries in one place should make the information easier to find and encourage improvements in the quality of collaborative work between VET providers, mobility service providers, businesses and other stakeholders and perhaps even the development of new cooperative approaches and solutions. The project will be managed by a steering committee and feature 2 sub-working groups. All resources and materials produced through the project will be freely consultable and downloadable via a dual-purpose website and will be available in the seven languages of the project.MATCHSI will help increase the impact of transnational work placements, leading to added value on a trainee\u2019s CV and thereby improving employability by helping to develop the skills required by businesses. This in turn may contribute to improving the quality of the labour force and helping to promote economic development within the European Union. Another anticipated long-term benefit of our project is to facilitate stronger partnerships between the educational and business sectors by increasing the involvement and ownership of host companies in the work-based learning process.

Its pupils prepare a vocational Baccalaureate either in \u201ctrade\u201d, \u201csales\u201d, or \u201creception and customer relationships\u201d. Pupils are expected to become shop-assistants, marketing people, or receptionists. The school is composed of 16 forms, and a total number of 390 pupils; 54% are boys, 46% are girls.\r\n\r\nThe pupils all come from secondary schools; some of them were already in a vocational class previously. Most of them had to go to a vocational school because they failed in their previous school career; so, they did not really choose this course. The educational staff faces high percentages of absentees all through the school year. Due to their absences, some pupils drop out, and not many pupils carry on higher education.\r\n\r\nFor more than ten years, the Head of school and the teachers have implemented some quality course which includes training periods in other European countries.\r\n\r\nThis present project plans to help 32 pupils, who will be selected among our four European forms, benefit from Mobility in Europe, in Bristol, Cork and Seville.\r\n\r\nMobility will enable our pupils to do a three-week training period which is part of the degree they prepare. They will train as shop-assistants or receptionists in companies or organizations ( shops, hotels, offices\u2026) The main tasks they will have to carry out will be those they study at school: welcoming customers, selling goods in a shop or online/on the phone, merchandising, managing stocks, using a till, speaking English or Spanish.\r\n\r\nThis project suits perfectly the European, national and academic orientations, and it can easily be achieved because the school has turned itself towards Europe for more than ten years. Also, it has stable, solid, fully skilled, experienced educational and administrative resources.\r\n\r\nThe participants are teenagers who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. They are not open onto culture enough, especially onto the European culture. Thanks to this mobility and to their work experience abroad, they will get broader and better professional skills and knowledge, enhance their cultural awareness, and improve their language skills and fluency.\r\n\r\nThus their social integration will be made easier. They will be able to apply to very specific jobs in companies dealing with foreign countries. They will feel more self-confident and may carry on higher education in relation with international business. Some may even go and work abroad.\r\n\r\nMobility will reinforce one of the school\u2019s assets which are its European forms. It will enhance the school\u2019s attractiveness and its international dimension. It will make it easier for our pupils to find work placements afterwards: tourism, sales and trade are privileged fields of our economy and French companies, branches of English and Spanish companies settled in France appreciate this double curriculum our pupils get both in foreign languages and professional learning.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the school is aware that professional and social mobility is at stake for the participants. That is why the choice of the local partner organization and of the companies in which the pupils will do their training periods will be made carefully and with great strictness. The teaching staff has got the right tools of checking and rating so as to give this mobility the best possible framework and to optimize it.\r\n\r\nEurope will thus mean something to our pupils.

C&C linked the key social concept of equal rights to emissions with the key ecological need for reduced emissions to issue a challenge to economic systems to develop fair processes for emissions reduction. CONVERGE aims to re-think globalisation by developing our understanding of convergence beyond emissions-trading across wider social, economic and ecological dimensions of sustainability. CONVERGE will research, develop and test the processes of contraction, convergence and divergence in current forms of globalisation. The research will be based on systems science to integrate social, scientific and economic disciplines in order to create coherent solutions to complex problems.  Key to the success of this study is the interdisciplinary approach and working with stakeholders from civil society, government and business. CONVERGE seeks to explore convergent sustainability relationships across different scales from local, national, global-regional to global. CONVERGE will research current examples of convergence in communities, policies and indicators moving towards sustainability. The project will develop a convergence frame for understanding and development in civil society and policy communities; accessible publications providing guidance and tools for the use of this framework; a set of Convergence indicators, quantitative and qualitative, that will be used to test and model the processes of convergence including development of a Computer Programme; and recommendations to assist policy makers to integrate C&C into the decision making process.  CONVERGE will play a significant role in achieving the strategic objective of EUs global partnership: 'to promote sustainable development actively worldwide and ensure that the European Union's internal and external policies are consistent with global sustainable development and its international commitments.'", 62946.0, 1488384.0, 5, 10, "CONVERGE", null, "http://www.schumacher.org", "/docs/results/images/2014/20141119140010.jpg", "fp7_92442_998133493"]]}}, "9JR": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2015, "Medikal Sim\u00fclasyon Uygulamalar\u0131 E\u011fitici E\u011fitimi", "University Bristols NHS Foundation Trust", 26232.0, 2, 2, "Medical Simulation is used in medical education in Europe and United States for many years. In this sense, the history of this practice in Turkey is 7-8 years old and is based on a few numbered of institutions / organizations.  The Provincial Health Directorate of Antalya as project coordinator and two members of the consortium Mediterranean University and Antalya Training and Research Hospital of the Public Hospitals General Secretariat are important organizations working on the administration of education in the health service and serving important for continuity of staff training will be working on creation and dissemination of applications in simulation training of health-related education and service institutions / organizations.\r\n \r\nHealth Sector is a kind of sector can not tolerate the possible complications or losses, which are the results of errors occurred in serving patients/humans because  the patients are human beeings. In addition, patients have an idea that \"they are an experimental subject\" for health personnel training, the conventional patient bedside training is changing and patient safety is being an important issue.  Medical simulation gives opportunities to gain skills and lots of practice to reach to mastery level to health students and health professionals with human patient simulators/standardized, simulated  patients which are very close feature to humans rather than actual patients by enabling the user to receive training by working on these models. In this sense, medical simulation becomes a bridge to fill the educational gap.\r\n \r\nThe project is aiming the development of medical simulation centers and training programs and applications of curriculum-based simulation is to gain knowledge and experience on the evaluation of training and simulation training programs at a Simulation Center which is experienced on simulation applications and use of simulation in medical educational training. Project participants will have the opportunity of participation and observation of practices about simulation related management skills, staff competencies, new teaching methods and tools, curriculum development.\r\n \r\nThirteen participants from 3 organization (Coordinator and 2 member of consortium) will participate to the project. Participants have different experience with simulation training.\r\n \r\nActivities of the project will be as follows; visiting BMSC in Bristol-UK, development and application of simulation educational programs for using in project partners curriculums, dissemination and evaluation of simulation education programmes in health institutions / organizations at national level.\r\n \r\nWith simulation based training programmes it is possible to perform education without giving any harmto the patients whose are the real subjects in health system. The health care givers also gain as reaching in mastery level in skills with repeatability facilities in simulation based education.  In addition to with the simulation based programmes developed and applied inthe light of needs, health care givers and students have a qualified and standardized trainings in international level , quality of care they have given to the patient and also the performance of them will be increased.\r\n \r\nThe expected outcomes in a long term are to have a leading role of these three organization in to raise  and apply, disseminate and evaluate simulation based education programmes for the other health institutions / organizations at national level. It is also expected from these three organizations to present their studies in meetings, conferences and congresses related to simulation for introduction in international arena, Europe, Middle East, etc.\r\n \r\nWith all these applications these three organizations aim to have a leading role in national and international arena in the implementation of training programs based on simulation in long term.", null, null, "erasmus_2015-1-TR01-KA104-018656_1"]]}}}}
