For successful implementation of Smart City technologies two main elements are\nconsidered:\n- Cities are the customer: considering local specificities in integrated urban plans and the need to develop monitoring\nsystems to extract conclusions for replication.\n- Solutions must be replicable, interoperable and scalable.\nREPLICATE considers also the complexity of cities, the tangible benefits for citizens, the financial mechanisms and the new\nbusiness models. The 3 pillars implemented in the pilots with the engagement of citizens, private actors and authorities are:\n- Low energy districts: cost-effective retrofitting, new constructive techniques with optimal energy behaviour and high\nenthalpy RES in residential buildings. Include also efficient measures in public and residential buildings: ICT tools, PV,\nshading or natural ventilation; district heating is demonstrated hybridising local biomass, recovered heat and natural gas.\n- Integrated Infrastructure: deployment of ICT architecture, from internet of things to applications, to integrate the solutions in\ndifferent areas. Smart Grids on electricity distribution network to address the new challenges, connecting all users:\nconsumers, producers, aggregators and municipality. Intelligent lighting will allow automated regulation of the amount of light\nand integration of IP services via PLC.\n- Urban mobility: sustainable and smart urban bus service, electric urban bike transport, 3-wheeler delivery and transport\nservices, deployment of EV charging infrastructures and ICT tools.", 320185.0, 25227198.0, "REPLICATE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_200256_992226096"]]}}, "outwardCode": "BS4"}
