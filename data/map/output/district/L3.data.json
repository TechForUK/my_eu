Over the past 15 years, a substantial amount of work has been done to determine the occurrence, fate, effects, and resulting risks of APIs in the environment and regulatory schemes have been developed requiring environmental risk assessments of all new APIs. However for most APIs currently in use, limited data are available on environmental risks and for new APIs, the testing regimes may not always be optimum. The aim of this project therefore is to develop frameworks that utilise information from toxicological studies, pharmacological mode of action and in silico models to support more intelligent environmental testing of pharmaceuticals in development and to prioritise legacy pharmaceuticals for full environmental risk assessment and/or environmental (bio) monitoring.

To address them, it will be necessary to solve some challenges from the methodological viewpoint, such as the extraction of relevant source signals in a multimodal (MRI and MRS) unsupervised approach, and the identification of the most appropriate number of source signals. A novel Bayesian approach of NMF tailored to facilitate the unsupervised multimodal analysis of MR data is planned to be developed, since Bayesian models deal with multimodal systems in a natural way, and the relationship between variables is explicit, as well as the handling of the prior knowledge.

Progress with MDG 5 in India (slow thus far) is a prerequisite to achieving the goal by 2015.\nBoth Indian programs were started to reduce maternal deaths by promoting institutional delivery and reducing access barriers to maternal healthcare for poor women. The two large scale, state run programs operate in two large Indian provinces. Each of these programs operates through the use of different innovative demand side financing mechanisms, which are specifically aimed at improving access for vulnerable groups. One program is a conditional cash transfer paid retrospectively to the woman on delivering in an institution while the other is a targeted bursary paid prospectively to accredited healthcare providers for delivery of the woman living below poverty. All payments are made by the state. While both programs are based on similar concepts, i.e. financial incentives for the provision and utilization of care; and the participation of the private sector \u2013 there are major differences in the socioeconomic contexts in which each program operates, financing mechanisms, provider payment models and incentives, quantum of financial assistance, level of private sector involvement, all of which will have a bearing on desired maternal health outcomes.

Public health facilities employed fewer obstetricians/gynaecologists than the private sector. JSY benefits were not offered in the private institutions. Moreover, between 15 and 50\u00a0% of JSY facilities lacked essential items such as antibiotics and IV fluids.

Recent studies suggest that vector/parasite genotypic interactions determine the success or failure of Plasmodium falciparum to infect mosquitoes. In this perspective, we will assay genome-wide polymorphisms in both parasites and vectors to dissect important genotype*genotype interactions, thus guiding the development of effective TB vaccines, drugs and remedies, and GM mosquitoes. Effectiveness of TB interventions, especially via use of GM mosquitoes, depends on the balance of infection and resistance costs. Components of this balance will be explored, to foresee the dynamics of vectorial competence in mosquito populations and assess the efficacy of TB strategies, as well as guide the development of new targets. Again, interaction between modeling and experimentation will be a powerful combination.

Current control measures are focused on eliminating the vector reservoir and avoiding contact with humans. However, such remedies have proved largely ineffective due to the rapid spreading of insecticide-resistant vectors.\n\nThe scope of the EU-funded http://www.transmalariabloc.net/ (TRANSMALARIABLOC) collaborative initiative was to develop novel strategies for minimising malaria transmission. Efforts mainly concentrated on rendering mosquitoes unable to transmit the parasite and included transmission-blocking vaccines and drugs as well as strategies to make mosquitoes resistant to parasites. Through model analysis they verified that current measures are inadequate for stopping disease transmission and more effective strategies are required.\n\nIn this context, the consortium screened a plethora of compounds and identified that natural extracts from Neem trees presented with significant malaria prevention properties. Interestingly, their work also unveiled a novel role of HIV protease inhibitors in the developmental arrest of the parasite. This finding paves the way towards the design of integrated therapies for both HIV and malaria infections.\n\nThe epidemiological work of TRANSMALARIABLOC discovered that certain antibiotics posed children at risk of disease transmission. Given the widespread use of antibiotics in African countries to treat other diseases, this result is of great significance to public health. Project teams were nonetheless hopeful that the identification of new transmission-blocking targets and the development of novel vaccines will effectively prevent malaria spreading in the near future. The two most promising vaccines (P25 and P230) are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.\n\nConsiderable efforts went into the genetic analysis of both the parasite and the vector, leading to the discovery of key genes and signalling pathways that are implicated in the process of infection. This strong genetic component of mosquito infectivity could help identify the specific ecological and geographical characteristics of malaria transmission.\n\nTaken together, the pioneering work of the TRANSMALARIABLOC study has firmly established the concept of blocking malaria transmission as one of the most valid approaches to disease eradication.

It is the only college within the city of Hamburg educating in the fields of catering industry and meat processing industry. It covers all aspects starting from occupational orientation and preparation, dual apprenticeship to qualifications earned at professional schools and master classes. The main focus lies on dual apprenticeship and vocational preparation. Dual training will take place for the following fields of occupation: specialist within the field of hotel management, specialist within the field of restaurant management, specialist within the field of catering industry, specialist within the field of hotel and restaurant industry and culinary chef. Also found under the same roof are the vocational college for the meatpacking industry which offers two fields of occupation - butcher and specialist within the field of meatpacking industry \u2013 as well as the vocational business and economics college which is widely known as a school of hotel management. Classes at the vocational college(s) have been set up due to the elected concentrations and not because of former education or working experiences. Our mission statement reads \u201cAbout practical experience, with practical experience, for practical experience\u201d.\r\nAll participants of this project are mostly within their second out of three years of their apprenticeship. The apprenticeship syllabus shows a general studies based working experience for the first part whereas it intends a joined specialization plus demands a specific concentration for each individual apprenticeship type during the second part. The G 11 apprentices are being trained in class as well as at their training properties and companies (=dual system). Classes are being held en block meaning two blocks of five to six weeks per year. About 64 apprentices are being able to receive grants for this programme each year.\r\nTraining facilities and G 11 have to approve the application process. The G11 as well as the participant(s) have to inform the chamber of commerce and the German hotel and restaurant association (DEHOGA).

The hotel and catering industry situated in the city of Hamburg is widely recognized and of highly international importance. Its international focus is the figurehead of the cities tourism industry. \r\nOutgoing mobility arrangements usually does not exceed three weeks length. This way more willing and interested participating apprentices are attracted while a too long absence from school is avoided. No harm in regards to a later reintegration into the former class as well as the curriculum or mid term is being done. \r\nDuring the first half of the first week the participants will be taking language skills and area studies classes. They will also be having the opportunity to join industry based excursions, tours and site inspections in order to compare and discuss the differences to their home company. The following practicum gives the students a good overview of the practical experiences needed in order to fulfil the desired outcome and/or position. Specific goals are service oriented workshops as well as the eagerness to gain additional trading skills in the departments kitchen, restaurant and reception. Extended non-industry specific language skills will be set into a determined cultural and occupational setting. Partnering countries include Spain, Italy, France, Czech Republic, Austria, Sweden and UK. A direct approach between all participating countries and partners is possible due to an excellent long lasting relationship and good standing to one another. The collaboration between instructors, trainers, trainees, apprentices, professors, agencies, chambers of commerce, governmental departments and social partners fosters content and organisational requirements. This guarantees a systematic transnational continuing education in the field of hotel and catering management in regards to content and intercultural relations.

The improved quality of vocational training makes the region attractive to young and high qualified people and gives them a real alternative to university. High qualified young people make Bremen attractive as a business location for companies and foster employment on a long term basis. \r\n\r\nThese objectives will be realized on the institutional as well as the individual level: \r\n\r\n1. Institutions of vocational and educational training should be aware of the fact that lifelong and border crossing learning is an important part of their work. By sending teachers and trainers abroad for study visits and jobshadowing the project encourages them to exchange their ideas of vocational education and training, to compare the different systems, work on international learning units (with the help of the ECVET instrumens) and deepen their own intercultural and teaching competences. They build up partnerships and ideas for more european projects. \r\n\r\n2.

The ultimate goal is to learn as much as possible from one another within the boarders of Europe. The Public Vocational School Hospitality and Nutrition (G11) entails three different parts adding up to about 2.722 students. It is the only college within the city of Hamburg educating in the fields of catering industry and meat processing industry. It covers all aspects starting from occupational orientation and preparation, dual apprenticeship to qualifications earned at professional schools and master classes. The main focus lies on dual apprenticeship and vocational preparation. Dual training will take place for the following fields of occupation: specialist within the field of hotel management, specialist within the field of restaurant management, specialist within the field of catering industry, specialist within the field of hotel and restaurant industry and culinary chef. Also found under the same roof are the vocational college for the meatpacking industry which offers two fields of occupation - butcher and specialist within the field of meatpacking industry \u2013 as well as the vocational business and economics college which is widely known as a school of hotel management. Classes at the vocational college(s) have been set up due to the elected concentrations and not because of former education or working experiences. Our mission statement reads \u201cAbout practical experience, with practical experience, for practical experience\u201d.All participants of this project are mostly within their second out of three years of their apprenticeship. The apprenticeship syllabus shows a general studies based working experience for the first part whereas it intends a joined specialization plus demands a specific concentration for each individual apprenticeship type during the second part. The G 11 apprentices are being trained in class as well as at their training properties and companies (=dual system). Classes are being held en block meaning two blocks of five to six weeks per year. About 48 apprentices are being able to receive grants for this programme each year.Training facilities and G 11 have to approve the application process. The G11 as well as the participant(s) have to inform the chamber of commerce and the German hotel and restaurant association (DEHOGA). Goals and learning agreement have especially been tailored to the participants needs. The hotel and catering industry situated in the city of Hamburg is widely recognized and of highly international importance. Its international focus is the figurehead of the cities tourism industry. Outgoing mobility arrangements usually does not exceed three weeks length. This way more willing and interested participating apprentices are attracted while a too long absence from school is avoided. No harm in regards to a later reintegration into the former class as well as the curriculum or mid term is being done. During the first half of the first week the participants will be taking language skills and area studies classes. They will also be having the opportunity to join industry based excursions, tours and site inspections in order to compare and discuss the differences to their home company. The following practicum gives the students a good overview of the practical experiences needed in order to fulfil the desired outcome and/or position. Specific goals are service oriented workshops as well as the eagerness to gain additional trading skills in the departments kitchen, restaurant and reception. Extended non-industry specific language skills will be set into a determined cultural and occupational setting. Partnering countries include Spain, Italy, France, Czech Republic, Austria, Sweden, UK, Ireland. A direct approach between participating countries and partners is possible due to an excellent long lasting relationship and good standing to one another. The collaboration between instructors, trainers, trainees, apprentices, professors, agencies, chambers of commerce, governmental departments and social partners fosters content and organisational requirements. This guarantees a systematic transnational continuing education in the field of hotel and catering management in regards to content and intercultural relations. The incorporation of new ideas into the apprenticeship enlarges the chances of each individual apprentice with in the European labour market.

The project aims therefore at increasing their competences as regard the use of interactive communication tools based on the web and the touristic e-commerce. The participants will be 110 students at the end of the fourth year of study at the following schools: ITCG Sansovino -Oderzo (Consortium Coordinator); ITST Mazzotti \u2013Treviso; IPPSAR Maffioli \u2013Castelfranco Veneto; ISISS Scarpa \u2013 Motta di Livenza;  ITCS  L.B.

The specific professional skill alone is not sufficient unless it is supported by the mastery of key competences, in particular as concern the communication in foreign languages, the digital competence, <learning to learn>, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, intercultural awareness. The project aims at offering the operators of the future some training opportunities which can strengthen these skills. This will be realized through preparatory activities and the mobility during summer 2017; the mobility will last 5 weeks, being the first one of preparation and the other 4 of full-time work experience in companies in Austria (Vienna), France (Paris), Lithuania (Vilnius), UK (Liverpool, Brighton , Reading, Torquay) and Spain (Valencia).

The reason why these young people leave their country are: escaping from persecution or serious damage, and thus seeking \"physical protection\", economic reasons and future expectations, and eventually reunion with their familiar.\r\nPsycho-social support actions are, therefore, relevant to understand their stories, the reasons that pushed them to migrate, their needs and their future aspirations. Such actions may also enhance, understand and develop their cognitive and affective behaviors, and protect them from the risks they may be exposed, thus facilitating their inclusion process within the hosting society.\r\nYouth workers and youth organizations can play, in these terms, an important role. Through informal and non-formal activities, they may provide the PIN-code, the access key to enter within the host societies, if they are trained and equipped with the appropriate tools. Starting from these considerations, the project \"PIn for ME\" aims at:\r\n- Improving the quality of the socio-educational animation for young migrants through cooperation among youth organizations and youth workers \r\n- Increase the capacity and improve the strategies of youth workers and organizations, addressed to the young migrants\u2019 support/inclusion\r\nThe project includes three complementary activities: a training, six study visits and a final seminar. In all the activities, a non-formal and informal approach will be used, based on confrontation, discussion and field experience and aimed at learning new practices and methodologies. In addition, the project's activities will address three main aspects of young migrants\u2019 inclusion: listening, participation and orientation. On one hand, the youth workers will develop good skills in listening to young people, and on the other hand they will have the opportunity to develop and acquire educational tools and techniques to propose structured orientation and participation to the young migrants. Each country group will consist of three youth workers (18 in total) from 25 years old (without age limits) who will be selected among the staff of the participating organizations or between their local network. These will participate in all phases of the project, supported by their organizations and the applicant.\r\nThrough the activities foreseen, participants will have the opportunity to acquire important cross-cutting skills (identify, prevent, counteract, experience, relate) useful in their personal and professional growth path in an increasingly complex and multicultural society where the phenomenon of migration is increasing. They will improve their attitude towards confrontation, listening, intercultural exchange, interpersonal communication, developing a self-critical attitude. As consequence, participating organizations, besides strengthening their operational capability and their European network, will benefit from the experience, skills and competences acquired by their participants in order to improve the quality of their work towards young migrants.\r\nIndeed, the project will also have a significant impact on them. Emotion management, empathy, self-awareness and knowledge of others, critical thinking, conflict management, are key skills for a positive inclusion that they can acquire thanks to the support of youth workers and organizations involved. In addition, educational programs and the activities carried out by these actors will help to prevent violent radicalization and spread European values such as tolerance, cultural diversity and non-discrimination not only among young migrants, but also among young people in general.\r\nLastly, long-term impact is expected at European, national and local level, both through a well-planned dissemination strategy of the project results and output, of which organizations and youth workers may benefit; and through the designing of a new project I the framework of the Ka.2 of the Erasmus + program, which will improve the quality of project follow-ups at European level and strengthen the partnership.", "http://www.expandinghorizons.co.uk  ", null, "erasmus_2017-3-IT03-KA105-012273_4"], ["4BJ", "International Youth Volunteering Programme", "The British Red Cross Society", 253965.0, "The International Youth Volunteering Programme's mission is to provide high quality long-term international volunteering experiences to 30 young people from across Europe, aged 18-30.

Selected volunteers will have the opportunity to take part in a range of humanitarian projects, which will enable them to develop their understanding and experience of active citizenship in a global world and enhance their employability skills.\r\n\r\nThe various projects included in this application are thematically linked by a common commitment to the inclusion of vulnerable groups, both at the local and community level; this focuses primarily on supporting vulnerable individuals in the community such as refugees and asylum seekers, the elderly, people with learning disabilities. \r\n \r\nIn line with Erasmus+ Programme specific objectives in the field of youth, our project aims to achieve the following:\r\n- encourage young people\u2019s active participation in society by helping them to increase their self-confidence and sense of initiative;\r\n- enhance young people\u2019s employability and career prospects, by enabling them to develop their skills in a safe, supported environment and validating these through the Youthpass framework;\r\n- facilitate opportunities for young people to develop enhanced inter-cultural dialogue. \r\n\r\nThrough a range of informal and non-formal learning activities and experiences, volunteers will be supported over the course of the placement to take an active role in society, and will also have the space for personal development, self-reflection and learning.

It concludes with a certificate of proficiency graded according to the Common European Framework of Reference and will be offered in this form in future. In addition, it serves as a basis for the planning and execution of projects with an alternative concept: two-week placements in cooperation with tried and new partners with the objective of exchanging views and experience of professional practice through company visits and discussion with all of those involved in vocational training. Furthermore, relevant topics can be included flexibly, e.g. current developments in the EU.\r\n\r\nOur contact to Lyc\u00e9e Pierre de Coubertin, Calais, will be reactivated. Rather than the previous three-week twinning with the emphasis on work placement, the future emphasis will be on small groups interacting and discussing. For trainees and teaching staff alike this should enable an international exchange of outlooks \u2013 not necessarily in English alone. Sitting in on lessons, company visits as well as extramural activities provide for enhanced intercultural competence and the opportunity for didactic reflection and development.\r\n\r\nThe relationship with Omnia, in Espoo, Finland, should develop along similar lines, whereby English will be paramount. By bringing together compatible professional sectors, greater emphasis will be placed on topics specifically related to the sector in question.\r\n\r\nOur new partnership with LSE in Liverpool provides two further offers meeting our aspirations: for our apprentices language development is the primary objective flanked by company visits with groups formed more on the basis of the level of fluency rather than their training focus. As our English department expands and is strengthened through the Vocational College English Qualification at the Oldenburg Further Education Centre, Liverpool runs a particularly apposite intensive course culminating in the Cambridge Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT). Participants not only consolidate specific vocabulary, but also through teaching their main subject to the Liverpool study group explore, expand and develop didactic approaches. A parallel course offered by the established International Study Programme gives us even greater flexibility to enable our staff to acquire further qualifications.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have offered our apprentices the professional KMK English Language certificate at Level B2. The successful initiation of the Europakaufmann qualification in cooperation with five other internationally engaged Bremen vocational colleges has attracted 47 participants in 2017. Along with concentration on the theme of International Commerce, the English KMK Certificate Level B1, qualification in a further foreign language at minimum Level A1 and the ECDL, a three-week work placement abroad with intercultural interaction is also required. For this we have the partners Liverpool and ECBM with their great experience. The europass will be issued for this.\r\n\r\nSending staff to support participants has definitely enhanced the success and quality of our Mobility projects to date and further strengthened the Internationalisation awareness of accompanying staff. Our expanding concept for Mobility involves intensifying the participation of staff in project activities.

The collaboration will go on to build loyal relationships with the hosting companies to involve the company mentors mostly.\r\nThe foreign network is enriched with a new partner, the Czech Republic in particular for carrying out work placements for students of the agricultural sector namely the viticulture & oenology ones.\r\n\r\nThe engagement towards the international opening will proceed together with the engagement to link the school to the local institutions and businesses that are the places where the participants will hand out their technical competences as well as the cross-curricular ones such as the communicative, personal and social skills that they acquired through the experiences abroad.", "http://www.lse.uk.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006388_4"], ["5SD", "FORINS 2018", "The Liverpool School of English", 235665.0, "The 95 scholarships for learners will take place in the summer 2019, as described in the project, confirming the same countries of destination as the years before: PL, CZ, EE, SE for technological and industrial  professional profiles; UK, DE, ES, and FR for those connected to services to businesses. \r\nThe learners will have finished their fourth year at high school; some accompanying persons will be required as many participants are under age or non-EU citizens.  Two learners with special needs will participate in the project.\r\nThe 8 staff people will stay in the UK  for two weeks,  4  in   2018 and  4 in  2019: the CLIL training module will be confirmed as the project  aims at increasing CLIL procedures systematically this is considered an investment for the whole teaching staff by the schools of the consortium\r\nThe schools  will introduce new CLIL modules, for about 80 hours, both during the first two years and the third and fourth years. This implementation is carried out through a)  the CLIL team, officially established last year, and whose members are teachers of the Staff mobility of the previous years,  b) school work groups, c) the CLIL network of 5 High Schools located in the area, born as an initiative of the CLIL Team.\r\n\r\nThe results reached so far have led the schools to  increase the participation of the teachers to international activities, therefore  the schools aim at improving the teachers'  language competence by promoting and organizing English courses  to get the staff  ready for B1 and B2 certifications. \r\nThe international activities of the consortium, for which a good competence in  English is needed, are the following: staff mobility, CLIL teaching, cultural exchanges, school trips with visits to foreign companies, support during study holidays abroad, and Erasmus + mobility, tutoring in international competitions (Robocup Junior), guided tours to the Museum  of textile machinery at IT Marzotto, activities to support groups of foreign students of the mechanical, IT and fashion sectors  during their work-training period in Italy (in case the projects submitted  in the countries of origin CZ, BG, PL will be approved).\r\n\r\nThe consortium aims at implementing  B1-B2-C1  language certifications of the students too. In 2017 the number of certifications grew by more than 13% thanks both to European Social funds  and to grants given by Pasini institute to 31 students in order to  cover half the cost of the certification exam. \r\nThe schools will increase the number of language courses for the preparation to the exams; 120 students, who will be interested in the Erasmus + project next year, are going to study holidays in the summer 2018 thanks to the project Move 5.0 that has already be financed by Regione Veneto with ESF.\r\nOther actions to reinforce the competence in foreign languages will keep going on,  these actions include lessons with mother tongue teachers (English, French and German), Cineforum, summer study holidays, school trips in foreign countries,  Smarter English (a full week of language lessons held by mother tongue teachers who, during the week, will be hosted by some students' families). \r\nIn order to foster the interest in the French language, studied  by a few students only,  Pasini institute will take part  in a National  Language Competition.\r\nThe schools will enhance international relationships even through E-twinning,  that will be implemented by 50%,  schools exchange projects for teachers, and new exchange projects with Chester and Malta. \r\nThey  will also keep promoting Intercultura   exchange programs, although it is quite difficult to monitor the results of this type of mobility.\r\nThe schools in Schio will continue exchange programs with Landshut. De Pretto High School will organize the annual exchange professional program for 15 students with Staatliche Fachoberschule. Despite English is the language used in the work place, all the schools aim at improving German learning too as DE is one of the most important trade partner for our local companies, for this reason German courses, addressed to both students and teachers, have already been organized.\r\nThe schools will also improve collaboration with local partners by organizing conferences in English held by Federmanager and by a EU official on international issues (Industry 4.0; Brexit and the implications for European Trading), for students of the 4th and 5th year of study, other conferences will be held for students of the third year on work-linked training issues. On \u201cCities for Life\u201d Day in collaboration with Saint Egidio Community, the schools organize a conference in English to debate on death penalty.\r\nAll the projects arise from the shared vision of the importance of multiculturalism and from the wish to enhance the feeling of belonging to Europe which will also lead to the participation of 40 students to the annual competition called EuroMaster organized by the Center for European Relationships and the  city hall of Schio.", "http://www.lse.uk.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT01-KA116-006432_9"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["2AJ", "Sensor City", "Sensor City Ltd/LJMU", "The centre will house, support and establish commercially viable high tech businesses working on sensor systems and applications.
