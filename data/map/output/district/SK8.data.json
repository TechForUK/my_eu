Based on the young people\u2019s follow-up ideas it was decided that the topic of the current project should be active citizenship. This is an area which seems very distant and inaccessible to young people with fewer opportunities and there is a danger that citizenship becomes yet another area of exclusion as active citizens appear to be generally more highly educated than their peers. Hence, there is a clear need to address the issue of young people with fewer opportunities being grossly underrepresented in formal and alternative modes of political participation. Through the activities in this project we aim to enhance the young people\u2019s knowledge and understanding of active citizenship and provide them with the skills necessary for active political participation at both EU level as well as local, regional, and national level. Furthermore the goal of the project is to enable the young participants to see both the value of engaging with the political process, as well as becoming confident to pursue opportunities for meaningful political participation. OBJECTIVES The objectives of the project are:- Enhance the knowledge and understanding of young people with fewer opportunities of active citizenship - Provide young people with fewer opportunities with the skills necessary for active political participation  - Increase self-empowerment and self-esteem of young people with fewer opportunities- Enhance intercultural awareness of young people with fewer opportunities - Improve foreign language competences of young people with fewer opportunitiesNUMBER AND PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTSThere will be 36 participants, out of which 24 will be young people facing educational difficulties , economic obstacles, cultural differences (immigrant background, minorities), and/or social obstacles. The participants should preferably be at their first transnational project experience.  The rest of 12 are the group leaders and interpreters. The young participants should be between 16 and 30 years old. The group of participants remains the same for both activities.DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIESThe preparatory meeting will take place in Stuttgart, Germany, on the YES Forum\u2019s premises, 15-16/02/ 2016. During the meeting they will review the project\u2019s schedule, activities, methods, evaluation, risks, and venues. As part of the first exchange in May, in Strasbourg, it is planned that the young people participate 2 days at the European Youth Event 2016 organised by the European Parliament. At the meeting it will also be discussed how the young people will contribute to the EYE.The first exchange in Strasbourg, 16-21/05/2016, hosted by Itin\u00e9raire Internationale, will have 6 days of activities.  The theme will be empowerment and will address access to rights and the importance of political participation by young people, with a focus on EU level participation. There will be workshops on active citizenship, preparation for and participation at the EYE 2016, an event aimed at including them in the EU-level decision-making process.The second exchange, hosted by the Stiftung Evangelische Jugendhilfe St. Johannis in Bernburg, 22-26/08/ 2016, will have 5 days of activities. This exchange will be an opportunity to reflect on the experience at the EYE 2016 and build upon it, as the same young people should participate in both activities. But the focus will be on the skills and knowledge necessary for participation of young people at local, regional, and national levels.METHODOLOGY The key concept of the project is based on non-formal learning approaches encouraging the active involvement of participants, giving them space to take an active role, express themselves and share their own experience. The following methods will be used in the project: icebreaking games, team building exercises, situational games, individual and group work, interactive presentations, open discussions, field visits, practical work, outdoor activities, and common project development.IMPACT AND LONGER TERM BENEFITSEncouraging young people to become active citizens has benefits for the young people as well as the communities in which they live. Giving the participants the opportunity to debate, explore first-hand, and reflect on active citizenship, will help them realise their full potential and encourage them to play an active role in their society, while their participation in a transnational youth exchange could improve their mobility. Furthermore, becoming more self-confident and able to communicate more easily could help them in the long term to access educational and professional opportunities they did not even dare to previously consider.

They will have new responsibilities and will be expected to contribute to the curriculum and organisation of teaching and learning in the new language departments,\r\n\r\nWe plan to develop a two-year project focusing on improving the skills of these newest members of staff, enabling them to teach their second/third MFL confidently, develop the skills to lead languages in the future, and maintain excellent provision for our pupils.\r\n\r\nWe would like to apply for 6 mobilities to take part in immersion training courses in France (4 courses), and Germany (2).\r\n\r\nThe courses are a combination of intensive language teaching through classroom-based sessions and focused tasks, cultural activities, methodology and pedagogy sessions, and the opportunity to spend time in a school in the Target Language country.\r\n\r\nParticipation in these courses will give an important boost to the skills and confidence of this very important group of staff as they begin their careers as language teachers.", "https://www.chhs.org.uk/", "Cheadle Hulme High School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047359_coordinator"], ["1JE", "Garga'n'Europe", "Together Trust", 7555.0, "The Special Education School Gargasindi from Calp main aim is the full inclusion of the students, betting on all those projects directed to favour the social interaction and participation of its student body at the same time we must assure a high-qualitiy education compliant with the individual needs of all of them.\r\nThe centre counts on an important career regarding the specialization of its professional team in different fields (new technologies, development disorders, sensorial integration, behavioural-cognitive intervetion, and so on) in order to let not only offer this high-quality educative response but also to lead us to establish ourselves as a Centre of reference of Resources for the rest of professional people of our influence area to keep spreading good practices and methodologies of specific intervention for the student body with functional diversity.\r\nThe purpose of carrying out this Mobility European Project (KA101) emerges so, from the necessity of improving the linguistic competence of the English language professionals since that can allow us to access to a greater amount of scientific and informational knowledge at the same time it pushes us to desire and want to take part in European Projects in the future that pass through the collaboration and cooperation between the different partners around Europe.\r\nOn the other hand, to cover the specialization needs and be able to offer a proper advice and orientation to the Education Community form which we take part, it is needed to go in depth with those educational experiences on the European level which, based on the good practices, let us know and develope strategies of valid intervention for our educational reality; at the same time we accomplish another objective as important as this, which is to spread and make public our centre and those innovative practices that we work as on an international level.\r\nThe activities that we value they lead us to our purposes are, in the first place, those related to the training in its two methods: specific of English language but also in English language for the training en drama methodologies, in order to achieve a greater ability and fluency through the learning of susceptible contents to enrich our project of dramatic arts.

It is essential the voices and needs of all the collectives to be represented and this teamwork in an interdisciplinar way has been reflected in our working methodology based on coordination, cooperation and distribution of tasks for the following discussion: reading of results obtained in relevant European Projects, reading of scientific texts about methodologies of intervention, participation in Courses and Training Conferences, divulgation and updating of social networks, communication with the partners and, also, composition of the project.\r\nRegarding the expected results and due to our previous experience, we expect to improve not only the English competence but also take advantage of this channel for the learning of dramaturgy tools that can be moved to our practices; a greater knowledge regarding training routes offered to students with special educational needs considering their training for social and work life; as well as the acquisition of innovative specific practices destined to get a greater specialization that assures an high-quality educational response in the intervention with the student body as much as the rest of professionals. All this without forgetting the importance of encouraging an enterprising and reliable behaviour facing new challenges as well as the creation of European areas of dialogue and exchange of new practices not only to revert to the centre itself but also to lead us to transform the society we want to build.", "http://www.togethertrust.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-ES01-KA101-049384_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "SK8"}
