Most cases are due to gross mistakes rather than fundamental inadequacy of available technology and methods. The reasons are manifold. Highly simplified calculation methods are used far beyond their domain of validity. Assumed boundary conditions such as occupant behaviour are not in accordance with actual usage; gross malfunctions in control and HVAC systems are left undetected in the commissioning process, while thermal bridges and distribution system losses are left without attention. Moreover, metered and sub-metered data are not used efficiently in calculation tools and engineering based simulation models during the Measurement and Verification (M&V) phase.\nTRIBUTE aims at minimizing the gap between computed and measured energy performances through the improvement of the predictive capability of a state-of-the-art commercial BEPS. TRIBUTE will extend the use of this tool to the commissioning and operation stages of a building. For existing buildings, M&V techniques will be developed and deployed to connect the BEPS model in real time to the pivotal wireless sensing and control systems of a monitored building. This involves modelling building systems to a higher fidelity than done today, developing technology for on-line identification of building key parameters, and automatically adapting the on-line, real time BEPS to the actual building\u2019s state.\nIn addition, BHM and EFM application will compare measured data to the then improved predicted metrics and will enable detecting building deviations. Advanced data mining methods will help evaluate these deviations. Subsequent Energy Efficiency Diagnostic Rules and optimization methods will provide cost effective and corrective retrofit actions accordingly.\nThe methodology and tools will be evaluated in the context of three different building types and locations.", 114734.0, 7955232.0, "TRIBUTE", null, null, null, null, "http://www.zedfactory.com", null, "fp7_109670_953804008"], ["7DF", "Autonomous Management System Developed for Building and District Levels", "Zedfactory Europe Limited", "To solve the energy dilemma, research effort was concentrated on stand-alone buildings weakly tight to their immediate environment. Specifically in each building only key sub-systems were considered individually. Such individual systems were made more effective by becoming pervasive into any building area (the reign of \u201cboxes\u201d and \u201ccontrollers\u201d). Importing parameters from other sub-systems allowed better regulations (Access or Occupancy management systems). Energy Usage Analysis tools are fairly new on the market. They provide the capability to analyse energy profiles of scattered buildings of large corporations. Energy usage analysis and planning on a district level is inexistent. Neither is Energy Usage Modelling leveraged in control schemes. This leaves an unexplored area for more effective building control schemes and suggests a potential of each smart building to contribute to District level energy optimization schemes, thanks to appropriate behavioural and stochastic models.\n\nIn parallel, efforts made many more renewable and cogeneration energy sources available as high capacity energy storage systems. Such systems now increasingly enter into the planning of large districts, but still timidly penetrate individual buildings. Thus, energy flows (electrical or thermal) can be managed through energy usage schemes, planned in time for significant savings.\n\nTo reach this aim, it is proposed to play in real time adaptive and predictive behavioural models of buildings and districts, exposed to weather conditions, human presence, energy-efficient materials and technologies. Such models will allow finding optimal supply/demand balancing. Building energy management systems will be turned in real-time configurable ones, bringing flexibility to the building. Thus, buildings will establish, in real-time, energy schemes with the district energy management and information system (DEMIS).

However, these require integrated approaches for cities, in terms of both research and development of innovative technological solutions and deployment. \n\nThe EU-funded 'Autonomous management system developed for building and district levels' (http://www.ambassador-fp7.eu (AMBASSADOR)) project seeks to implement a holistic method to optimise energy in a city by examining the efficiency of its districts and buildings. To achieve this, it will exploit the possibility of shared use of local energy production and storage. \n\nActivities are centred on the district in its entirety, defined by the consortium as a collection of buildings, industrial facilities, activities or services that consume or produce any type of energy. \n\nBuildings account for a large amount of energy consumption in districts, and this is where project efforts began. Researchers are designing energy conservation solutions, including heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems and hot water preparation, to lower consumption in buildings. \n\nProject work is continuing with the design of real-time energy optimisation strategies at district level by taking into account key actors, including energy providers and distributors, as well as consumers. \n\nResearchers continue to define the hardware and software architecture for a centralised and intuitive energy management system that is at the core of AMBASSADOR. It will work by gathering information from all the smart systems and then decide the best way to balance the energy at district and building levels. The system will be validated in building sites in Greece, France and the United Kingdom. \n\nAMBASSADOR intends to render districts and buildings more energy efficient through the application of pioneering technology.
