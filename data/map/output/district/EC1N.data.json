The market is very interesting, but very competitive too, with an increasing demand of games that are bigger, better and with more realistic computer graphics.<br/>Such qualitative and quantitative advancements in videogames present many draw backs for developers related to increasing costs, need of complex management systems, longer asset creation pipelines etc.. These factors have direct negative consequences on the videogames industry in Europe: they reduce the number of titles released, impede creativity involved (a typical equation is: the more original the idea resulting in a bigger risk and thus lower investment), they stifle innovation and this may cause a financial overexposure of developers.<br/>In CR-PLAY we propose an innovative mixed pipeline for videogames development which will drastically reduce both time and expenses involved in the creation of assets, and make high quality realistic contents accessible even to small game developers. Game developers will be able to capture and reconstruct houses, buildings, trees and other real life elements by simply taking a few sequences of photos and videos to be processed by the semi-automatic software created in the project and integrated with traditional assets made of polygons and textures.<br/>CR-PLAY's approach will represent a major shift in the content creation pipeline for games, with an important positive impact on development costs and time-to-market. The simplicity, speed and quality of the new pipeline will have far-reaching consequences, freeing resources to achieve more creative games faster and cheaper and consequently giving a significant competitive edge to the European SMEs in the game sector.", 137265.0, 2780342.0, "CR-PLAY", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_110377_951566994"], ["2ST", "Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on Movable Cultural Assets. \u2013 Innovative Research for Market Transfer", "Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England", "The MEMORI proposal will provide the conservation market with innovative measurement technology, improved pollution effects knowledge and evaluation and control methods for the reduction of gaseous pollutant impact on movable cultural assets, - facilitating increased and safe use of protective enclosures for cultural heritage (CH) objects located indoors in new or rebuilt buildings for collections, to satisfy demands for energy saving to mitigate climate change.

The project was coordinated by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research and carried out by 14 partners, 4 subcontractors and an advisory end-user group.\n\nTogether, MEMORI partners looked at the role that organic acids (acetic and formic) play in accelerating the ageing of organic materials.\nThey performed experiments at laboratories, primarily testing cellulosic material, varnish, pigments (including inorganic pigments), parchments, textiles and leather.Results showed that all organic materials were impacted by their exposure to organic acids, and in some cases even at very low levels.\n\nNext, the group looked at the use of absorption materials to reduce the presence of organic acids in enclosures. Priority was given to materials with high absorption rates at a low cost. Data from the above experiments were used to develop new recommendations for tolerable pollutant levels.\n\nMEMORI also built on technologies from two earlier EU projects, AMECP and MASTER, to create two devices to measure IAQ.\nThe devices, called dosimeters, are sensitive to indoor climate, light and acidic air pollutants, and come in a permanent and hand-held form.\nOne university partner went further to develop a luminescence-based oxygen sensor to test oxygen in airtight enclosures.\n\nUsed in conjunction with new online software created by MEMORI, museums can now measure IAQ, evaluate its risk and decide on cost-effective mitigation strategies.
