The participants involved are taught how to run marketing, coaching & community activities.  They acquire accredited qualifications, work experience & skills that not only help them get a better job in the future, but also increase their general life chances.  By positioning learning within the context of the Sports industry, we get commitment from participants who have historically struggled with personal motivation towards learning.  This project will further enhance that learning experience by introducing them to best practice in European Football Clubs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll 60 participants will be economically inactive or unemployed before enrolling on the programme, over the age of 16 and living in social deprived areas of Wales.  Specifically we will be targeting: 40 NEET people aged between 18 & 25 years; 10 individuals over the age of 50; 5 individuals living in supported accommodation; and 5 with challenging behaviour or learning difficulties.  Many\r\n\r\nParticipants will be from families of multi-generational unemployment, homeless, or early school leavers, and have little or no aspirations in relation to what employment could potentially do for them.  The mobility widens their horizons and raises their aspirations, and helps break the cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur objectives are that the participants go on to: \r\n\r\n   (a) take a higher level coaching qualifications to UEFA license level. \r\n\r\n   (b) undertake higher level business/marketing qualifications\r\n\r\n   (c) enter the labour market be it in the football or sports industry\r\n\r\n   (d) learn foreign languages\r\n\r\n   (e) achieve positive outcomes and life skills\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the European placement they will:\r\n\r\n- observe and shadow Youth Academy coaches\r\n\r\n- deliver coaching sessions to Youth teams\r\n\r\n- take part in seminars from leaders in major European football clubs (Benfica, AC Milan, Torino FC, etc) on nutrition, Psychology, Commercial development and marketing\r\n\r\n- go on stadium tours, sightseeing and watch a football match\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Erasmus+ project is finally complete, a journey will come to an end.

People whom previously had no skills or qualifications, lacked in confidence, & were long term unemployed; will have a totally different outlook and a renewed sense of hope & belief. They will have a high level of self-esteem, and possess the skills and qualities they need to seek, remain and progress in future employment, training or education. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a sense of self-fulfilment, and for potential employers to fully understand what training they have completed; the skills they have acquired; and the work experience they have gained.

Particularly in Europe, a continent with a great deal of immigration and population movement, it's important to devise innovative, practical approaches to social work with children, adolescents and adults to be successful. Communication, cooperation and the exchange of experiences and expertise between the various organisations at the international level play a major role in this. \r\n\r\nAll of the organisations involved in the \"Peer Aktiv education & cross mentoring\" expert exchange use sport as a platform to facilitate access to the target groups. In this regard, all of the participants exhibit a high level of expertise in the field of educational social work, which allows for a high quality exchange of ideas that can in turn form the basis of a successful practical action plan in the future. Sport plays an important role here as it appeals to all social strata and target groups and has the ability to break down obstacles, such as language barriers.\r\n\r\nAs one of these specialised social organisations and host of the expert exchange, this is the area the Deutsche Soccer Liga [German Soccer League] would like to address. Besides exchanging experiences and networking, the focus of this project should be on forging a plan to deal with out-group hostility. This two-day seminar, involving four partners from Spain, Wales, Romania and Hungary, is the first step in the process. It will involve ten multipliers from each partner organisation, who will then be instrumental in devising, executing and following up on theme-related projects in their respective countries. The discussion will focus on the following key aspects:\r\n\r\n\u2022 swapping personal experiences, approaches and actual cases  \r\n\u2022 reflecting on how hostile attitudes in sport has been reacted to and dealt with in the past and\r\n\u2022 developing viable courses of action and selected training modules that the organisations can use for the purpose of internal training on perspectives. \r\n\r\nThis will be performed using a variety of methods (that have proven highly successful in the past). It's important that all the project participants play an active role is this. Interactive exercises, work in small groups and whole-group discussions will be held to present the topic in an interesting and practically oriented manner. The centrepiece of the project will be a sports module, to be run by the participants, which will provide them with the perfect change in perspective and thus facilitate access to their target groups who find themselves in just this position.\r\nThis is where the German Soccer League's Street Soccer Module comes in, as it makes this change in perspective easier by providing a specially designed set of rules.

In this sense, our project offers a great opportunity to train our students professionally in another country. The aim of this project is to give continuity to the one started in 2011; providing the students with specific mobilities, which encourage their European awareness and having the vocational teaching staff involved in the training process as well.\r\nPrecisely, the project is addressed to vocational training students from IES EL BOHIO( Secondary Education and Vocational Training School ). It aims to accomplish 6 mobilities, 2 for pupils who want to become experts in nursery care, 2 for technicians in Emergency Health Care and 2 for Technicians in Computer Network Systems Management.  In addition, 4 mobilities for vocational teachers are included in the project for having a job shadowing training program in France.\r\nIn order to prepare, settle and start these mobilities, teachers from IT, Health, English, French and Professional Orientation Training departments will work together as a team, counting on the full support and involvement of the management board of the school. \r\nDue to the specific features of our vocational studies, the age range of our pupils varies from 17 to 30 years old, so students under 18 may be part of the program. In addition, they come from middle-lower class families so having the possibility of applying for Erasmus + funds will allow them to have access to opportunities that otherwise they would never have. \r\nThese students will have their internships and work placements, assigned according to their profile; fact which will be certified both by EUROPASS and by workplace training agreements. Furthermore, the EUROPASS certificate will be also granted to the teaching staff.\r\nSo as to guarantee a right implementation of these internships, the tutors from the hosting companies will be fully informed about the capacities, skills and competences that our students will have to achieve during their stays. Their tasks will be clearly stated and specified in training agreements, signed by all the parts involved in the process. Needless to say that the hosting company and the tutors in Spain will have a direct and fluent interaction by means of the internet, using tools such as social network sites ( Facebook,...), Moodle, Etwinning and so on.\r\nThe results and conclusions drawn after the end of the mobilities will be shared by all the members of the teaching community of IES EL BOHIO.  Moreover, it will serve as a reference to other institutions located in our region, Regi\u00f3n de Murcia. The job shadowing training program will also allow the vocational training teachers to have a deeper knowledge of the companies which host our students during their internships. To make the project have a valuable impact, the mobilities will be available and shown in most of the relevant social networking sites and web pages.\r\nThese actions will have a great impact on our students since they will be able to improve not only their foreign language skills but also their professional and team ones. Furthermore, the program intends to make our students be familiar with other working environments and cultures from other countries. These experiences will enable them to adapt and cope with unexpected situations. Obviously, all these facts will enhance their professional qualification, future employability and entrepreneur spirit.\r\nWithin the school, students from lower courses will know the possibility of applying for this type of grants. They will, consequently, be highly motivated to study. It is also important to mention the fact that our school will have an innovative and European projection at local and regional terms.\r\nIn addition, the job shadowing process of the teaching staff, part of the vocational training department will cause a major involvement in their education, and professional qualification. In fact, the job shadowing training in a foreign country and the way internships are organized abroad lead to the international improvement of the teachers\u00b4 methods of management and work.\r\nWe strongly believe that in the long run, all the students taking part in this type of programs will be more competent, creative and self-confident professionals.\r\nAs far as the teachers\u00b4 mobilities are concerned, they will reinforce the ties with the hosting institution (Red Cross Training Institute), achieved with the previous projects.

In this aspect high importance lies in communication, cooperation and exchange of experience \u2013 for instance a professional exchange between different organizations on the international level.\r\n\r\nThe organizations taking part in the project use sport as an instrument and as a platform to develop social competences (in a basic and uncomplicated manner) and to facilitate participation of young people in the society.\r\nBSJ is the largest youth organization in Brandenburg and also a professional social organization with years of experience in the field of international youth work. As the organizer of this international youth exchange, BSJ would like to develop relay bodies, that will further develop the project concept in their own countries; develop networking of the project organizations; implement and facilitate with partners the commonly designed and established concept of Fair play - focusing  particularly to group-specific intolerant behaviour and hostility.\r\n\r\nThe core of the project is the concept \u2018Street-Football for Tolerance\u2019.

An end product will be a book on problem solving techniques to use, examples of problem solving questions and posters to help pupils solve problems independently. Year 2 - Reading - During year 2 we will tackle developing basic skills in reading. Reading is a basic skill that is essential for our pupils to learn to live and work effectively in the 21st century. They need to be independent readers who identify: why they are reading; what they want to get out of the material, and how thoroughly they need to understand it.

Year 3 \u2013 Oracy \u2013 develping critical and open thinkers - We will use books to discuss issues and develop their roles as active and thoughtful global citizens. This will ensure that pupils develop to be critical thinkers through being taught how to create their own philosophical questions which they then explore together to open their minds so they can live interdependently in the 21st century and face any obstacles or challenges thrown at them in life by having an open mind and ability to discuss with appropriate vocabulary.  This will allow pupils an opportunity to create their own philosophical story to promote thinking and discussion based on The Unicef Children's Right's Charter. The final product will include a published ibook of stories.The project will have a great impact not only on professional development our own schools, but also on local schools in the surrounding area and local authorities  as we will share the practices with them. It will raise the quality of teaching and learning and impact on the future of our pupils by raising standards of attainment in basic skills as well as developing them as ethical and informed young Global Citizens. The long term benefits will be far reaching! The opportunities that our pupils will have faced will be invaluable to supporting them to become global citizens who realise their roles and responsibilities.
