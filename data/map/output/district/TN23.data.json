This can be explained through the Salutogenic model; a model consisting of three factors created by Antonovsky (1987). The model questions; \u201cWhy do some people stay healthy, both mentally and physically, and why others don\u2019t during a stressful situation?\u201d According to Antonovsky this is dependent on three factors; to have a greater understanding of one\u2019s life, receiving a greater meaning from life and being able to manage life. Sports has the potential to support young people\u2019s understanding of their situation through purposeful activities and physical exercise. Sports is also a positive way to engage with the local community, create networks and cooperate while encouraging a positive community response. Sports projects with young people is a common tool to increase integration and the individual needs of the young people involved. This project will be informed by Antonovsky\u2019s approach as participation in sports is a way to promote health despite the presence of stress in a young person\u2019s life which will stabilise young people. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are; \r\n1. To promote and empower youth people\u2019s individuality through sport; Confidence, self-perception and self- image. \r\n2. To encourage young people to try and actively participate in a range of sports activities \r\n3. To eliminate gender barriers within sports and challenge the segregation towards the participation \r\n4. To promote positive social inclusion through inclusive sports activities. \r\n5. To help build a sustainable local and international network with young people and their organisations. \r\n\r\nThe project will involve partners from; UK, Italy, Turkey and France and will include a total of 34 young people and their youth leaders. Each country will have 5 young people. The main target group within this project will be disadvantaged young people between the ages of 13-17 years of age of any age while Swedish local participants will be 10. \r\n\r\nNon-formal methods will be used throughout the project with the following activities; Workshops. question and answer sessions, small group discussions, sports session, visual tools- flip charts, online presentations, case studies, images and videos, film making, guest speaking, exercise sessions, reflections, evaluations, intercultural evenings, cultural visits. The expected impact is to give young people the possibility to participate in more sports and to give a sense of both awareness and empowerment about gender issues in relation to sports. Young people who participate in this project will experience positive social inclusion. It will furthermore impact local and international networks motivating them to get more involved in their local communities  and organisations and act out as active and well informed citizen.

This is mainstreamed at the end of the project. Shared teacher training workshops in each country are designed and delivered by expert early years language specialists with a wider interest that incorporates extending the curriculum to take account of culture as well as foundation learning. The CILT Toolkit created across the partnership is tested at a Final Event held in the UK near the end of the project. Each partner hosts one event and incorporates a half day event that is open to a wider audience that includes people from the local community, the media, representatives from support agencies and colleges/univesities and policy makers.\r\n\r\nTo inspire early years language learning in children, the project works class to class through Skype with 24-30 children in each school, using initially Makaton sign language to communicate with each other, then progressing to learning and illustrating simple, everyday words in each language, building into a picture dictionary, illustrated by the children themselves. At the end of the project this dictionary is marketed to parents and the wider community.\r\n\r\nThere is a final Seminar in the UK to disseminate project results and to debate the future of language learning in a wider, united world, led by a cohesive Europe, promoting mobility of opportunity, equal opportunities and social justice for all.\r\n\r\nIn a widening Europe it is essential that schools offer the most effective social and educational integration for newly arrived pupils.

Despite its significance, measuring metastatic potential as well as potential indicators of therapy efficacy remain unmet clinical challenges. Recently, it has been demonstrated in vitro, that aggressive metastatic cells pull on their surroundings suggesting that metastatic potential could be gauged by measuring the forces exert by tumours. Furthermore, many solid tumours show a significantly increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) which prevents the efficient uptake of therapeutic agents. As a result, a reduction in IFP is recognized as a hallmark of therapeutic efficacy. Currently, there is no non-invasive modality that can directly image these forces in vivo.\nOur objective is the non-invasive measurement of both IFP within tumours as well as the forces they exert on their surrounding environment. This will be used to predict a tumour\u2019s metastatic potential and importantly, changes in these forces will be used to predict the therapeutic efficacy of drug therapy. To attain this goal, the biomechanical properties of the tumour and its neighbouring tissue will be measured via MR-elastography at various measured deformation states.  Resultant images will be used to reconstruct images of the internal and external forces acting on the tumour. We call this novel imaging modality Magnetic Resonance Force (MRF) imaging.\nWe will calibrate MRF via cell cultures and pre-clinical models, and then test the method in breast, liver, and brain cancer patients. Thereby, we will investigate whether MRF data can predict metastatic spread and measure IFP in patients.  We will also investigate the potential to non-invasively modulate the force environment of cancer cells via externally applied shear forces with the aim of impacting cell motility and proliferation.
