Improved energy efficiency within buildings is, therefore, a priority objective in enabling Europe to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments. Whilst a desirable architectural feature enabling enhanced occupier comfort, windows are recognised as a key weak spot in the building envelope, resulting in heat losses during winter months due to inferior insulating properties, and excessive solar heat gain during summer months, resulting in energy-intensive air conditioning. Such window-related losses represent 10% of a building's energy consumption (4% of Europe\u2019s total energy use).\n\nWhilst super-insulating window designs are commercially available, more limited progress has been made towards cost-effective solar heat gain control (SHGC) technologies. Existing solutions are primarily based on low-cost tinted films that permanently block a proportion of light entering the room (leading to room darkening and negative energy efficiency during winter months). Whilst dynamic (switchable) films have been developed, such materials demonstrate either inferior properties or are cost prohibitive.\n\nIntegrating emerging materials science with a cost-efficient polymer-extrusion process, the SOLARGAIN project will develop an innovative low-cost all-polymeric switchable reflective SHGC film. The film will enable dynamic optical properties in response to the changing lighting, heating and cooling needs of the room, and thus improved natural lighting, occupier comfort and enhanced energy efficiency. The SHGC films will be incorporated within:\n\n\u2022 A highly-insulated sealed-window-unit design targeting > 90% window-related energy saving\n\u2022 A retrofit window-film structure targeting > 90% energy savings associated with room cooling\n\nThe window systems will integrate photovoltaic and sensor technologies, thereby enabling self-powering and intelligent activation. Achieving cost competitiveness with existing window systems, the SOLARGAIN technology will also demonstrate significant long-term cost savings through enhanced energy efficiency.

If the heat- and light-filtering properties of windows can be dynamically controlled, energy costs could be significantly reduced.\n\nSOLARGAIN is an EU-funded project that aims to develop the materials and production processes required for such smart windows. Specifically, the intention is to create a polymer window film that will allow an energy saving of more than 90\u00a0% by controlling heat loss and gain.\n\nResearchers investigated and identified the best commercially available chromophores (chemical compounds that absorb specific wavelengths of light). These were combined with various polymers to form a film able to coat glass. Several combinations showed strong potential for future use and further research will focus on developing the glass-coating process.\n\nThe complete smart window should also incorporate photovoltaic (PV) and sensor technologies. These would allow autonomous activation or deactivation of the various film components.\n\nSOLARGAIN has thus already made exciting advances towards implementing dynamic polymer films for smart windows.

For most young people digital technology is an everyday part of life and many of them are eager to learn how to creatively engage with it. In view of this fact it is surprising that there are so few learning opportunities for this group of young enthusiasts who are usually left alone when they venture into authoring their own \u2018apps\u2019. In Poland there are very few learning spaces for young digital makers and none in the region of Wadowice. The UK is leading developments in this field, still the learning experiences on offer are much below demand. Wavemaker is the only such initiative in their area. Our main aim is to engage young people in collaborative digital making and foster their technical and social competencies relevant for employment. We are addressing two current call priorities.- Horizontal priority: open and innovative education, training and youth work, embedded in the digital era- Youth field priority: promoting high-quality youth workOur main target group are young people with fewer opportunities, particularly those who:- go to school but have very few opportunities to get involved in extracurricular learning activities due to their location, accessibility, price, etc.- finished school but neither continue education nor work; this group is particularly hard to reach with an educational offer, still it includes a large number of young people deeply submerged in a digital world.We will provide a range of experiences for the young people that are innovative as a whole. We will give open access to a social learning space with an informal workshop atmosphere distinct from school environment. The young participants will be able to manipulate both hardware and software to co-create their digital laboratory. They will co-author an online platform testing various plug-ins to customise it to their needs and preferences. They will create apps with support of qualified staff and colleagues who already work in the industry. This direct contact with professionals will help them better understand career routes in this field and their own progression. The support we plan is thus complementary and innovative at the same time: usually ICT learning opportunities for young people, if available, include onsite computer workshops teaching specific technical skills and online materials for self-teaching. We aim at a much wider range of benefits than those gained from (self) development of technical expertise. Our baseline research findings highlight this point: progression into digital creativity with prospects to real jobs means not only mastering a set of specific technical skills but also developing social competencies in a community of practice.Besides offering digital making activities in both our centres we will develop the following results.- Online platform: the platform will serve as a learning and communication tool for young digital makers and facilitators from Poland and the UK thus bridging the two sites. All the digital objects developed by the participants will be shown on the platform as well as links to external resources supporting the learning.- Community of practice: face-to-face and online communication around a set of shared interests will lead to emergence of an authentic community of practice. Through the process of collaborative learning the young people will have an opportunity to develop themselves both professionally and socially.- Digital stories: there is evidence that an ability to imagine what real careers look like is essential in planning one\u2019s own pathway. Young people need to relate their emerging identity to role models in the field they are engaged in. We will go beyond facilitating face-to-face encounters with such young creative and successful people who may serve as role models and encourage them to share their career experiences in the form of digital stories.- Digital club toolkit: there is high demand, both in Poland and the UK, to create new or scale up existing social learning environments for young digital makers as the current number of opportunities is lacking when compared to the levels of interest. We will distil effective approaches from our initiative and other good practices and present them to educators and youth workers.- Research report: we will explore young people\u2019s progression into digital creativity and jobs in Poland, where there are very few datasets on this, and present conclusions to stakeholders in the field of youth work and education.
