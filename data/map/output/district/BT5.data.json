In such situations, Collaborative Crisis Management (CCM) is usually coordinated by local authorities or dedicated civil protection organisations, supported by a variety of different national and international crisis management organisations, all acting relatively autonomously. The process is typically coordinated through periodic physical meetings of the involved organisations, in which information is shared about the situation, priorities are set and responsibilities allocated.

For example, due to the sudden flow of asylum seekers to Europe there is an urgent need in the adult education sector to learn new ways and methods of how to teach newcomers in intercultural settings.This project aims at promoting intercultural learning by developing arts-based and action-oriented methods and by producing new, high quality material for intercultural teaching and learning. Moreover, the project\u2019s objective is to enhance educators\u2019 capacities to shape intercultural awareness and teach intercultural competences in culturally diverse settings.Participants and methodology: During the project, we create, test, teach and evaluate a variety of methods in the six adult education institutions in Finland, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Italy, Romania and Poland. Each partner will be piloting different arts-based and action-oriented methods in their local groups. These pilot groups will be culturally diverse and there will be learners from a variety of backgrounds. For example, participants include deaf people, people with disabilities, refugees and people with different socio-economic backgrounds. As intercultural competences consist not only of knowledge but also skills and attitudes such as empathy and active listening, learning beyond the book is vital. That is why we are exploring how different kinds of arts-based and action-oriented methods can be effectively applied in multicultural settings. By combining creative practices with theories on intercultural competences, we develop new insights on how to create spaces for intercultural learning.Results, impacts and long term benefits:The project results will bring a lot of innovative approaches to the choice of the methods for intercultural learning activities. The main output is a digital guidebook which contains all the materials developed through the project. The book provides new theoretical approaches on intercultural teaching and learning as well as practical methodological tools for educators. Moreover, the e-book is interactive and includes game-like elements and learning via social media.

Caregiving has appeared as an emergent job where more and more workers are demanded all across Europe. Even though the employability level, the majority of home care workers don\u2019t have adequate training in the tasks they are regularly required to carry out as they receive more theoretical classes than daily practices training in the home care sector. Moreover the training has not taken into account the differences regarding health protocols and best practices in the different EU countries, limiting the caregivers\u2019 capacities and opportunities.\r\n \r\nCARE4U objectives are to provide innovative approaches based on practice (better than theory), and to focus on the individual needs and expectations after their first approach to the labor market. CARE4U offers a participatory method supported by ICT-based methodologies, using an online learning tool with different ICT technologies that will provide to the participant the training in their preferred format.\r\n \r\nThe majority of home care workers don\u2019t have adequate training in the tasks they are regularly required to carry out, as they receive more theoretical classes than daily practices training in the home care sector.  In consequence, adequate training is required in the home-based sector for two reasons: on the one hand, it is recognized that adequate training attainment improves the employability of people and, on the other hand, because better and more innovative training programs are required in order to avoid that under-qualified people carrying out works where the lack of qualification could be translated in risks for those who require their services.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo tackle with this, CARE4U provides an online learning platform which fosters knowledge and training exchange for those people who, in spite of their training through educational courses, need additional practical knowledge for the achievement of relevant and high quality skills and competences in the home care sector. CARE4U allows experienced people to share the knowledge they own after several years of working in a bilateral learning/training process where all the sides involved are benefited: either for learning a new skills, sharing experience or gaining new contacts and opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to share this knowledge in the most proper and suitable way, a set of methodologies for teaching/learning (i.e., video, tutorials) will be defined based on the user\u2019s preferences: moreover specific training CVs will be defined, based on the needs identified by the caregivers and the specificities of each country, and generated, creating proper training material to cover them.\r\nSo, CARE4U provides the training and mutual learning on the topic, preparing better those who are already active as caregivers, allowing those who are unemployed to acquire skills which can help to open up a career in the care sector at home. In consequence, the bank of knowledge that CARE4U will own, will be focused on caregivers. Thus, our main direct target groups are:\r\n\u2022         Non-experienced caregivers that are trained by experienced caregivers in a trustworthy space.\r\n\u2022         Unemployed caregivers that seek for adequate training or learning a new skill in order to increase the possibilities of employability.\r\n\u2022         Formal and informal caregivers that require committee by professionals about a certain topic.\r\n\u2022         VET and higher school professionals when reaching the labour market as a training guide for practical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPatients and the care sector as a whole will also benefit from the personalized and adequate training provided by CARE4U constituting the indirect target group of CARE4U. The project will generate a community which will help to enhance cooperation among caregivers across the continent. In consequence, CARE4U will put in contact qualified and non-qualified caregivers located in different parts of Europe so the knowledge could be exchanged between them, creating a definite benefit to the home-based care sector of Europe.
