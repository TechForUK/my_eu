We have the \u201cCurriculum for Excellence\u201d, the new \u201c1+2\u201d approach and a range of new/revised qualifications, including National 4/5 and the new Higher and Advanced Higher. Curriculum for Excellence emphasises developing students to be Successful Learners; Confident Individuals; Responsible Citizens and Effective Contributors, as well as highlighting global citizenship. The 1+2 approach is a pledge to secure wider languages learning for all Scottish pupils. The new qualifications emphasise the new need for pupils to reflect on the advantages of learning languages. There is an enhanced European/Citizenship dimension, coupled with a more relevant, career languages approach. Realia, real contacts and new technologies are emphasised. Languages teachers are required to use the target language in lessons far more than previously and to have more up-to-date experience and awareness of developments in the foreign language country. Teachers are required, with the move away from text books, to be able to plan and develop many new kinds of resources in a more evolving manner, with emphasis on real materials and new ICT.\r\n               In Eastwood High School, languages are gaining even more prominence as the school undertakes to meet these new requirements. Spanish is becoming ever more popular and this has implications for curricular choices and for staff training. \r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nMalaga Immersion Course (FM) aims: to enhance my ability to teach Spanish, adopting the above new changes and requirements, with enhanced linguistic and cultural skills and more up-to-date teaching methods and resources. I aim to contribute to Eastwood High School\u2019s successful implementation of all of the above important changes and requirements.\r\n               Exchange with Cordoba aims: We aim for our students to experience Spanish life and culture - and to develop: enhanced linguistic skills for their future work lives; potentially lasting links and friendships with Spanish citizens and a wider sense of their own global and European citizenship values.\r\n\r\nNumber and Profile of Participants\r\nApplying to travel for the 3-week Spanish immersion course: 1 (Fiona Malcolm)\r\nInvolved directly in Spain-Scotland Exchange Visit Planned June 2015: 70\r\nImpacted on more widely from exchange visit planned June 2015: potentially 1000+\r\nImpacted on from wider exchange (using ICT etc.): potentially 2000+\r\n\r\nActivities\r\n1. 2014 onwards: Exchange using new technologies between students from C\u00f3rdoba and from Eastwood High School\r\n2.

The three week immersion will enable the participant to enhance their personal language skills and increase their competence in the language with particular regards to speaking the language. \r\n\r\nThe participant will be exposed to the culture, geography and history of Spain and be equipped to share this knowledge and experience with learners. \r\n\r\nNew resources will be developed which will focus on contemporary Spanish culture and new ICT methodologies will be explored. \r\n\r\nThe course will also help the participant to transfer skills and good practice from teaching French into teaching Spanish. \r\n\r\nThe school wants to develop our participant\u2019s Spanish language skills and teaching abilities so that it can expand the number of languages offered and increase uptake numbers. This is particularly important within the context of the Governmental Languages Policy which entitles all pupils to exposure to two foreign languages before they leave Primary School. Without the training of our participant the school cannot adhere to this policy. \r\n\r\nThis application is being submitted on behalf of one member of staff. She currently teaches French and has studied Spanish in her free time to learn the language but has never experienced an extended period of residency in the county nor received any substantial pedagogical training specific to the teaching of Spanish. This course addresses the needs of our participant. \r\n\r\nThe course will also enable the participant to be registered as a Spanish teacher with the General Teaching Council for Scotland who have endorsed this course.  \r\n\r\nThe course combines language teaching which will be targeted to participants individual needs and pedagogical training on how to teach the language. Language training will be conducted in small groups or on a one to one basis. Teacher training will take the form of workshops, lectures, group work and personal assignments. The course will be run entirely in Spanish. Cultural experiences will also be organised and participants will be encouraged to converse in Spanish solely throughout their time on the course.\r\n\r\nParticipants will take part in micro teaching, swap ideas and materials and gain fresh perspectives from other teachers from different settings. All of this contributes to ongoing professional development and will sharpen her teaching practice. \r\n\r\nThe staff member will have the opportunity to engage in professional dialogue on the topic of language learning with teachers from across the country. Engaging with teachers from different settings and with different experience will provide a unique opportunity for our staff member to gain fresh insight into how Modern Languages are being developed throughout the country. \r\n \r\nThe participant will return from the course with enhanced linguistic abilities and a fresh enthusiasm for the language. Her increased proficiency and confidence in the language will enable her to use more target language in the classroom. New resources and methodologies that can apply to the teaching of French and Spanish will benefit learners of languages in the school. In the short term the participant will be able to use their experience to promote the language in the school by offering a lunchtime Spanish club and running other events such as European Day of Languages or celebrating Spanish festivals as a way of making Spanish more visible in the school.\r\n\r\nPotential long-term benefits include Spanish becoming a feature of the timetable in Primary with progression all the way through the Secondary school. Pupils will have the option to study two foreign languages and study the culture of these languages thus widening their horizons and adding a more European dimension to their learning experience. There may be also be the opportunity to develop European links through further engagement with the Erasmus programme.", "http://www.belmontschool.co.uk", "Belmont House Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-013253_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6AH", "ACUTUS PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT LIMITED", 21915.0, "Legal advice, litigation and infringements \u2014 Legal expenses (25.01.08)", "fts_2017_14598", 2017], ["6AH", "ACUTUS PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT LIMITED", 4252.0, "Legal advice, litigation and infringements \u2014 Legal expenses (25.01.08)", "fts_2017_28499", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "G77"}
