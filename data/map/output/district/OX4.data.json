We propose that it will be possible to modify brain function and pathophysiology by targeted delivery of specific curative factors to selected populations of brain cells that are affected by disease. This opens the door for effective treatment regimes, which can be tailored to individual patients needs. However, currently available gene transfer vectors have limitations regarding safety and efficacy, as they do not allow for targeting of specific populations of neurons or glia or regulation of transgene expression.  The NEUGENE consortium has been founded by leading European scientists from academia and industry to overcome these limitations. The consortium will develop Adeno-associated virus (AAV) and Lentivirus (LV)- based tools for targeted and regulated gene transfer into different populations of CNS cells. The consortium will provide a selection of vectors that are optimized for different therapeutic approaches, e.g. regulated expression of neurotrophic factors or manipulation of neurotransmitter synthesis in specific neurons. NEUGENE has three major goals:1) targeting gene transfer vectors to specific populations of neurons and glia, by transcriptional regulation and miRNA-mediated de-targeting and by exploiting the cell-specific tropism of novel types of viral vectors, 2) tight control over expression levels of therapeutic genes by using regulated systems based on different principles, and 3) establishing the safety of the novel vector tools.  NEUGENE will verify the functional efficacy of the novel CNS gene transfer tools in a well-established animal model of Parkinson's Disease (PD).

European scientists aimed to apply this approach to neurological disorders where no alternative treatments are available.", "Great progress has been made over the last decade in understanding mechanisms and principles of both normal brain function and central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although this information makes new treatments for nervous system diseases more realistic, current pharmacological treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases offer only symptomatic relief and cannot influence the course of the disease.\n\nAlthough still an experimental approach, gene therapy presents a promising strategy for permanently correcting a genetic phenotype. Several proteins and regulatory RNAs have been identified to regulate normal brain function and affect disease progression. Targeting these molecules directly through gene therapy may be more time- and cost-effective compared to medications developed through classical pharmacology.\n\nSeeking to treat major neurodegenerative disorders, the EU-funded 'Advanced gene therapy tools for treatment of CNS-specific disorders' (Neugene) initiative worked to overcome existing limitations of current gene therapy vectors for safe and efficient approaches. The consortium used Parkinson's disease as a model with a goal to target viral vectors to specific cell types of the brain and achieve regulated, efficient and safe expression of therapeutic molecules in either neurons or glia.\n\nVectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus (LV) were developed that specifically delivered therapeutic genes to astrocytes and to the main target cell population affected by Parkinson's disease. Through specific promoters and regulatory protein-based approaches, partners achieved targeted transgene expression.\n\nWith respect to safety of the developed vectors, the consortium showed that existing immunity towards AAV serotype 2 could compromise the efficiency of transfer and transgene expression. The use of alternative vectors based on equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV), to which humans are not naturally immunocompetent, argued for a superior safety profile.\n\nNeugene vectors were functionally validated in a mouse model for Parkinson's disease, demonstrating restoration of motor performance. Also, neurotrophin-expressing vectors were patented and put forward for clinical development.\n\nOverall, the Neugene research solved significant issues regarding the gene therapy of CNS disorders.

The economic sectors most represented within the province are agriculture, construction and services. The industry is centered mostly in the forest wealth of the province (wood and resin). In addition, Cuenca has 1 Business Park and 3 Industrial Estates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that the City Council decided to promote this initiative is due to the worrying situation which the city finds itself in, due to unemployment which is currently made more urgent due the economic crisis which we are experiencing. Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence. The training periods of 3 months and will take place between middle of April and July 2015. The countries that will host future participants will be the UK, Italy and Austria.\r\n\r\nParticipants will receive language training before their departure through the online course which the Erasmus+ Program will make available to them, since the languages of the host countries are integrated into the course. In addition, prior to departure, participants will receive socio-professional and cultural training organized by the Consortium team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results which CUENCA PLUS provided are:\r\n- To consolidate practical training that strengthens the knowledge acquired by young people.\r\n- To promote the improvement of the teaching-learning relationship and academic training.\r\n- Professional specialisation.\r\n- Promoting language proficiency with the aim of achieving bilingualism.\r\n- Promoting the autonomy and responsibility of young people.\r\n- To understand how an EU company operates promoting the entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n- To promote intercultural education as a basis for quality European training.\r\n- To improve social skills of young people.\r\n- To promote mutual understanding of academic training in the different EU countries.\r\n- To develop values such as solidarity, tolerance and respect amongst young people.\r\n- To promote recognition of their studies.\r\n- To promote the multiplier effect of mobility experiences.\r\n- To encourage the economic development of the city through better preparation of their young people.\r\n- To encourage the economic development of the city through better preparation of their young people.\r\n\r\nThe expected impact associated with this project: \r\n- Increased competitiveness at local, regional, national, European and / or international levels; \r\n- The flow of the economy, knowledge and ideas; \r\n- Increased collaboration and cooperation between institutions and businesses at international level; \r\n- A social and cultural impact which will create more tolerant citizens.\r\n\r\nThe expected long-term benefits are: \r\n- Improving the quality of candidates for jobs; \r\n- Expanding frontiers in the search for work; \r\n- Generation of new skills; \r\n- New approaches to work.", "http://www.amey.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA102-002297_20"], ["2JY", "ENCOURAGING SOCIAL COMMITMENT", "Oxfam", 24329.0, "Instituto Cuatrovientos Strategic Plan 2012-2015, has two Strategic Objectives reflected in Strategic Line 3: The internationalization for the development of transnational mobility programmes\u201d and \u201c systemize the services management of information and labour guidance\u201d.

The theme of the project is 'Democracy and Diversity' enabling young people to look at how they can have a voice in their own futures, learning respect for the democratic process and an ability to value diversity in terms of culture with a particular emphasis exploring what they feel it is important to stand up for in relation to their human rights as young people. This theme will be taken into Mesh and reflected in all aspects of the programme from the types of interactive workshops on offer, to food, through to the social programmes that run alongside the creative ones.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to give young people from different countries the opportunity to collaborate and share their work with young people from across Europe improving understanding and acceptance of different cultures and a step towards building community cohesion, through creativity, performance, debate and discussion and social activities. This will enable young people to respect and value democratic processes in relation to diversity by considering how young people feel about this in their own countries and in relation to Europe and the different cultural influences within it, reflecting on how a society and a culture see, create and record their experiences of the world.\r\n\r\n Together the young people will explore and develop a positive pragmatic European response to this principle transcending barriers and perceptions and opening doors to new understandings especially thinking about how the human rights principles of freedom, respect, equality and dignity are manifested or not. 40 young people many from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and some  from single parent and low income  families in the UK, Netherlands and France,  will take part in an 8 day and 6 day residential exchange which will include workshops, discussion groups, a structured social programme and practical hands-on tasks related to the daily management of the exchange.  Another component of the Exchange is the creative exploration of the theme through a variety of artistic expressions such as street theatre and parades, individual and collaborative performances and skills based workshops. Local community volunteers will contribute to daily practical support in areas such as catering and interpreting.\r\n\r\nIntegral to the exchange will be the nurturing and honing of the young people's creativity and ensemble working which requires the young people to be personally open yet also sensitive to the needs of the whole group in its cultural diversity, ensuring democratic processes are engaged in to make decisions and to give an equal voice to all. The young people will be supported to be creative and artistic risk takers encouraged to see these skills as transferable in all walks of life but especially in relation to creativity and \r\nentrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Exchange a full report will be written in collaboration with all the partners detailing the key outcomes  of the arts workshops, performances, discussion groups, debates, and any other relevant sessions. Much of this report will be the result of ongoing narratives from the young people involved and will detail the longer term benefits of enhanced intercultural awareness and dialogue and a deeper understanding and tolerance of diversity.

The young people will socialise, eat and live together for the duration of the exchange and practice speaking in a foreign language. Throughout the 8-days they will spend time in their own country groups reflecting on their learning, considering changes and developments they want to make during the exchange and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to give young people the opportunity to collaborate and share their work with others from across Europe, improving understanding and acceptance of diverse cultures and building community cohesion. This will enable young people to respect and value democratic processes in relation to diversity by considering how they feel about this in their own countries and in relation to their role in Europe, reflecting on how a society and a culture see, create and record their experiences of the world.\r\n\r\n Together the young people will explore and develop a positive pragmatic European response to this principle, transcending barriers and perceptions and opening doors to new understandings, especially thinking about how principles of freedom, respect, equality and dignity are manifested or not. 20 young people, many from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and some from single parent and low-income families in the UK and France, will take part in the exchange.  Local community volunteers will contribute to daily support.

It will support EU schools to meet this need by increasing their capacity to use youth participation through global citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSFYOUTH is delivered by 5 organisations who run support programmes for teachers and schools to use youth participation and global citizenship. They are Oxfam GB (UK), Oxfam Italia (Italy), PAH (Poland), CARDET (Cyprus) and the Institute of Education (UK).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is based on the partners experience that when delivered effectively, these approaches help schools by:\r\n\r\n- Creating more engaging curriculum and using learner centred pedagogies: using real life global issues to inspire, and informal youth/adult methods to inform pedagogy, e.g. Future Workshops \r\n\r\n- Engaging and motivating youth: global issues interest youth (e.g. Think Global/MORI 2008), and being active change agents motivates youth\r\n\r\n- Developing transversal skills and competencies: YPGC supports skills (e.g. critical thinking, communication)  and personal development (e.g. confidence, self esteem)\r\n\r\n- Increasing civic engagement: YPGC inspires youth actions for social justice locally and globally, and supports peer leadership\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project methodology is to use the current experience of partners promoting two programmes in particular: Future Workshops (by Oxfam Italy) and Youth Ambassadors (by Oxfam GB). The project will widen and deepen youth participation through global citizenship by supporting teachers to apply these informal youth methodologies to core parts of the formal curriculum. It will also support youth to apply these methodologies more effectively by themselves in informal and formal education. It will also support school systems to better recognise and support teachers and young people to do this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore the project objectives are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJ1: To develop innovative support for European teachers to use these approaches effectively through their core teaching \r\n\r\nOBJ2: To develop innovative support for European youth to use these approaches to support social actions through their formal and informal education\r\n\r\nOBJ3: To influence school systems across Europe to increase opportunities for teachers and young people to use these approaches in school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, SFYOUTH will work with 4 hub schools in the UK, Italy, Poland and Cyprus to develop 6 high quality intellectual outputs that are innovative and relevant for target audiences in project countries and across the EU.  These include innovative online support tools for teachers and youth to use these approaches, an online sharing portal, and academic reports and policy recommendations into their effectiveness at improving educational outcomes and civic participation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resulting outcomes will be\r\n\r\n- Teachers using these approaches for new and engaging curriculum and pedagogical methods \r\n\r\n- Young people using better quality processes for youth engagement in school, inspiring greater motivation and interest in civic participation\r\n\r\n- Increased sharing of these approaches by and young people online\r\n\r\n- Increased motivation to embed these approaches by key stakeholders in the school system, including education ministries\r\n\r\n- Increased confidence of project staff to support teachers and young people using these approaches in new ways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will lead to the following direct impacts with 176 teachers and 4400 youth:\r\n\r\n- Improvements in teachers practice, youth motivation, transversal skills and civic engagement in project schools \r\n\r\n- Increased sharing of these approaches by staff/teachers/young people in project schools \r\n\r\n- Improved scale of support for YPGC offered by our partner organizations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough our dissemination activities, this will also lead to the following indirect impacts with 10,000 teachers and 250,000 youth:\r\n\r\n- Greater use of YPGC by schools, and subsequent improvements in teachers practice, youth motivation, transversal skills and civic engagement across the EU\r\n\r\n- Greater support for YPGC across the school system in our own countries and across the EU\r\n\r\n- Wider use of these approaches in these and other fields across the EU\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will improve in the capacity of the applicants to support schools with such approaches, achieving educational improvements and improved civic participation.
