The life science industry has come to realise the trends and potential of miniaturisation which already have effected the information and communication industry in the last decades. Combinations of microfluidics, microelectronics and microoptics provide striking opportunities for advancing biomedical research and creating new markets for the medical sciences industry. In terms of economical and ecologically worthwhile processes, complex Micro-Nano Bio Systems (MNBS) have greatest potential to enhance processes for cell-based assays, chemical analytics and medical diagnostics.However, there are three main challenges for such (MNBS) market to overcome which hamper growth of the market: First, a lack of economical micro-fabrication methods hamper the implementation of lab-on-chip solutions in an industrial scale. Second, inefficient interfaces between laboratory equipment and mircofluidic devices cause a lack of interoperability. Third, there is no integrated manufacturing platform which provides flexible and cheap design and re-design opportunities.<br/>ML\u00b2 will overcome these three main challenges by developing a cost efficient production system for new generation MNBS, combining microfluidics, optics and microelectronics.

The situation becomes more complicated if the condition of less opportunity refers to disabilities and when these disabled are young people. Nevertheless it is proved and it is shown everyday from TV and social media how people with disabilities own very special competences or skills in specific fields and can be as much efficient and effective as the others. The struggles that young people with disabilities have to face in life are challenging but we don\u2019t have to see them being limited by their disabilities. On the contrary we have to understand their different abilities and we have to accept that thanks to those they can play important roles within our communities and work environments.\r\nDespite this, the problem of inclusion of people with disabilities is real and felt in all countries, no matter how much good they are in developing social inclusion policies. Indeed, we see the problem on 2 sides. People with a disability are often excluded or given a different status by other people because they do not fit the social expectations. On the other hand often the mainstream activities finalized to include people with disabilities do not include people who don\u2019t have any disabilities and in this way activities implemented by institutions have the opposite effect which is contributing to raise the exclusion for disabled people.\r\nThe main issue is exactly the common consideration that the society has of disable people. We need to start to consider their qualities, what they are able to do and regard them for this rather giving them some benefits for what they are NOT able to do.\r\nThanks to our everyday work with young people that own disabilities (mental or physical) we have had the opportunity to prove that all that expressed above is completely true.\r\nThat\u2019s why ABICI has decided to promote this project: Evenehanded opportunities for youth disabled, a contact making event aimed at bringing together 24 youth workers representing 12 partners from all over Europe to discuss and share best practices that effectively work for including young people differently able at any level in our societies. Our ultimate goal is to create a network of different actors (youth NGOs, public institutions\u2026) that commit together for developing effective strategies for supporting real inclusion of youngsters that are differently able.\r\nIn this context the objectives we want to achieve are:\r\nto promote cooperation in the youth field to create better opportunities for inclusion of disabled youth\r\nto promote a better understanding of the added value that diversity can bring to our societies\r\nto create actions to help our societies to face the economic crises with fresh entrepreneurial ideas\r\nto build up partnerships for projects that help disable youth to acquire competences for entering the labour market\r\nto use the Erasmus Plus programme as a tool to support personal and professional development of young disabled\r\nto get to know best practices to improve social inclusion and recognition of different abilities \r\nto promote intercultural learning and diversity.\r\n\r\nConsidering what described above the objectives of this CME goes in the same line with the objectives set up by Erasmus+ Programme as we are promoting active citizenship, participation, inclusion and respect for diversity. The project, even if it is a contact making event is not only designed to set up new partnerships but also to reflect and to foster inclusion of youth with disability, focusing on positive examples from different countries.\r\n\r\nEvenhanded opportunities for youth disabled will be based on three main parts: \r\n1) exploring the concept of inclusion and exclusion in our societies and find tools useful to foster inclusion;\r\n2) sharing good experiences in disability field, presentation of possibilities that Erasmus+ Programme is offering for young disabled people; \r\n3) Setting up new partnership and design concrete project ideas within Erasmus+ working mainly on promotion of inclusion, participation and active citizenship.\r\nFirst and foremost we have considered that the priority for young people with a disability to find out more about EU and its opportunities is going abroad and share his/her time with young people from other countries. We have chosen some of our partners through Salto-Youth database who have a policy of including young people with a disability in their regular activities and some of them were already our partners involved in the field of disabilities.  We have discussed and found out more about the topic of our project through online meeting and emails . We have selected partners with a good level of experience in working with people with fewer opportunities, or that work with young disable people and interested in creating high quality projects in this field.\r\nAfter the selection of the partners we have clarified the sharing of responsabilities during the project ( as development of the project,  the application for funding, the preparation of participants, the journey planning , booking and preparing the venue, the implementation of the programme and the reporting & follow-up, etc.). In this way all partners involved have a clear picture of all commitments and the project has an equitable and satisfactory division of tasks.\r\nThe variety of organizations will allow to have participants experienced and  well-trained in EU regulation framework linked to the topic, participants with experience in promotingg resilience among young people resident in deprived communities, participants that have already implemented activities linked to the topic with the involvement of local body, trade associations, unions, ye-clubs, private foundations and universitites.\r\nThank to this \"mix\" will be possible to ensure to have a good level of participants highly motivated to find out more about the topic above and reach the objectives of the project.\r\nThe variegated nationality and culture of the partners will give an additional value to the project as different is the approach to the topic in their respective countries. The fact that we will have 8 partners will help the dissemination of the project results. All the partners share the objectives of the project and are committed in work together to achieve the project\u2019s results.\r\nThe participants will be chosen by the partners and they will be selected after filling an application where they will explain their motivation, contributions, expectations, commitment to collaborate in the follow up of the project and in the dissemination of te rsults. The final application for the call for participants will be created during the preparation phase and  by al the partners.\r\nParticipants should not be here on ly to listen, but they will have to bring the experience of the work of their organisation, as well be able to share it and take back the knowledge and skills developed during the activity. \r\nWe will advice to have people with different kind of experience in the group, different disabilities and abilities, different cultural and social background. It will be an extra opportunity and value to work in groups made of youth with disabilities, with experience working with disable, with experience working with \"normal\" youngsters, with people that never worked with disable youth... all of them will put their effeorts to enrich the experience of the group.\r\nIn conclusion our target group of participants will be made of youth leaders and youth workers (some with experience in activities addressed to young afflicted with disabilities, some with experience in youth work in general, some working with different kind of disadvantaged youth) all motivated to acquired skills, knowledge and competences from eachother.\r\nIn this way, we will also guarantee the diversity of level of experiences that can bring to positive dialogue and exchange of practices, points of view, and ideas.\r\nWe, in association with our partners, will make special application forms which will indicate questions regarding the topic of the contact making event. Interested people will apply through their own organizations and then after discussion with the partners we will make selection which will be based upon their experience, knowledge and willingness to participate and contribute.\r\nIn order to ensure diversity in the project we are expecting people from different ages, but always at least 18.\r\nBecause the topic of youth disability is quite wide and disputable we will prepare the content of the contact-making event in a way that allow us the opportunity to be flexible with the age group, as far as we are bringing people from different  sectors. Nevertheless, we will make sure that there will not be a very big age gap between participants. Due to this requirement we believe that the project will involve a proper age range coherent with the perspectives and atmosphere of this topic. \r\nThe same attention will be put on gender balance. It is important that the participants will feel thenselves in a friendly and safe environment where they can feel free to express what they are. We will ask to our partners to pay attention that gender balance will be taken into considerationwhile spreading the call and during the selection. Our organization will also take care about checking that this rule is respected, unless there are important reasons for exceptions (i.e. motivation and experience), which cannot anyway represent a too big gap between the numbers of the people from the different genders involved.", "http://www.disabilitykarate.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-3-IT03-KA105-009524_11"], ["0QB", "Network of Inclusive Communities in Europe", "THE DISABILITY KARATE FEDERATION LTD", 36076.0, "Around 15% of the population of Europe has a disability.

One of the outcomes we noted was that there was a significant difference in the strength of the sense of community in the northern European compared to the southern European groups of disabled people.  The southern Europeans appeared to have a far stronger sense of community but also appeared to face greater barriers to participation in society.  The northern Europeans sense of community was very weak even though barriers to participation in society had largely been removed and this was evidenced when many British parents, carers and disabled athletes did not join the celebration meal and after party which had been arranged for them.Disabled people have been marginalised within traditional communities and they are now being marginalised in the new communities of social media.

Social media are free to use and are utilised by young people as a communication tool to keep in contact with people all over the world. They inform friends about their lives, share information and arrange events or meetings.  Twitter may even be used to publicise events and buy tickets, Instagram used to communicate through images and facebook for longer and deeper conversations and even relationships.  Young people are able to identify like-minded people by looking at their lifestyle and comments on social media.  Young people are creating groups on social media to connect people from different countries, backgrounds and cultures and promote inclusion.  Young people are more likely to be informed about world events through social media rather than watching traditional news media. Young people are exposed to many different and varied opinions.  Opinions are formed by talking directly to the people who may be involved in a news story rather than receiving the information second-hand.  Social media has the effect of reducing tensions in society and increasing understanding of different cultures thereby reducing the barriers between people and creating inclusion and strengthening communities.\r\nNICE 2 TALK intends to be the final  outcome of the iknowledge and understanding we gained in two previous projects looking at media, communications and communities with Kyu Shin Kan, and to build on our ongoing relationship with Hayashi from Germany who work in the same disability field as the Disability Karate Federation.  NICE 2 TALK will investigate the relationships of disabled and disadvantaged young people and the barriers to inclusion they face within local communities, the barriers to relationships within the local community and with a particular focus on the wider communities of social media.  The objective will be to utilise the findings of our previous projects and extend this knowledge through further work with a group of 12 disabled young people and 12 disadvantaged young people. 12 carers and parents will support the young disabled people along with 10 disability, communications and social media experts from the three partners.  The project will be supported by CITA charity which will provide expert volunteers from University College London to carry out the coding work. \r\n\r\nThroughout the project, young people will learn to extend their communication competence through different methods; non-verbal and verbal, written and social media including Twitter, facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Whatsapp, Skype, pintrest, Tinder, Googe Translate.  The project also aims to develop young people's skills in social and civic competence, language and social media and increase their digital competency and cultural awareness so that they can be more fully included in society.  \r\n\r\nOur previous Erasmus projects found that there are serious safeguarding concerns about social media amongst parents and carers for both young non-disabled people under the age of 18 and for young disabled people of all ages many of whom who remain vulnerable whether they are thirteen or whether they are 30, especially those with learning disability or autism. \r\n\r\nThe main object of NICE 2 TALK will be to help disabled and non-disabled young people understand how to safely use social media while they will inform the design and build of a safe inclusive social media app that will assist in creating inclusion, strengthening friendships and communities and changing self-perceptions of disabled people in different countries.  \r\n\r\nAll of the activities within the project are designed to address the communication needs of the young disabled and disadvantaged people and to assist them to fully participate, achieve and enjoy the feeling that achievement brings", "http://www.ikkaido.eu", "IKKAIDO LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035350_coordinator"], ["0QB", "Empowerment, Vitality and Assertiveness - Female Education in Mentoring", "IKKAIDO LTD", 67685.0, "EMPOWERMENT, VITALITY AND ASSERTIVENESS - FEMALE EDUCATION IN MENTORING (EVA-FEM) will bring together 39 young women and girls and leaders from Ireland, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia France and Greece.\r\n\r\nEVA-FEM is a project to develop competences around the well-being of disadvantaged young women who have experienced different psychosocial threats and exclusion, immigrants, victims from conflict and disaster, traumatic events like spinal injury, victims of violence and additionally for young females from the wider community who may have had a personal crisis. The project intends to empower the young women, promote independence  and increase competences and different types of communication skills that will enhance their psychosocial well-being.\r\n\r\nThe main aims are to empower and integrate young women and girls who are disadvantaged giving them a sense of their identity and value and their improve their competences and strengths by exploring the self-confidence gained through self-defense tools. Ultimately they will explore the need to create a framework for a course of self-defense and empowerment which they themselves may go on to teach.\r\n\r\nAggression can take many forms.  Martial arts and self-defense are not just a physical response to violent aggression.  Self-defence is firstly about not putting yourself in danger and always being prepared.  Self-defense is the realisation of what constitutes an attack and that physical aggression is often an escalated level of attack that began with a verbal confrontation or some imagined slight.  Self-defence is about defusing those situations before they have had time to escalate.  A physical response is the last line of defence.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, studies have shown that by being physically active, and the strength and stamina that is developed, some conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, depression and high blood pressure can be eliminated or reduced.  The stronger sense of values and identity that is developed through martial arts can help disadvantaged women and girls to maintain a higher level of independence which increases self-esteem and self-confidence which can lead to education and employment opportunities.\r\n\r\nEVA FEM will create resilience for young women who have had significant life events so that they gain the ability to react and adapt positively to difficult and challenging events and experiences and bounce back from them in a positive way  \r\n\r\nEVA-FEM will show that sport can change the lives of young women from different disadvantaged backgrounds in Europe and beyond to get them more involved and integrated into society and also make them happier and more motivated.\r\n\r\nTo address these issues three youth exchanges will be organized involving self-defense, sports and outdoor activities. These activities will be based on non-formal and informal education methods.\r\n\r\nThe activities allow the improvement of skills and potential in self-defense and provide self-motivation, self esteem, a sense of safety and independence to the participants. The participants will have the opportunity to get an insight into self-defense tactics and gain new experiences and use their abilities and knowledge to improve their skills.  They will learn to share their feelings and how to build trust.\r\n\r\nThe activities will be monitored by experts who have dealt with disadvantaged people and women and girls for a long time.\r\nThe objectives are to show that young women and girls are able to share and take responsibility;  that they can participate and cooperate successfully in society. \r\n\r\nThe context and objectives revolve around the topics of inclusion, equity, gender violence, gender discrimination, and the empowerment of women in general but specifically those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Whilst internet access provides great benefits in discovering things about the world, it also causes collateral issues in terms of e-safety,.  It was felt that digital literacy was poor.  A recurring theme was that bullying and intolerance had become rife on social media not just for young people, but for everyone in society and this seemed to be reflected powerfully in traditional communities, creating intolerance, hate speech and prejudice especially against people with fewer opportunities as well as a rise in \"fake news\" and populism.  It was thought that social media had had a significant role in the current shift from democratic liberalism to a rise in prejudice and right-wing extremism.  Reflection and review from participants in the recent EVA-FEM project on the empowerment of women showed that bullying and cyberbullying were the greatest issues facing young people and digital literacy was what they most wanted to address.  The young people have led the idea for this project and have been active in the writing of it.\r\n\r\n93% of 16-24 year olds access the internet in the Eurozone (Eurostat 2016).   Mobile devices proliferate at an increasing rate with over 90% of young using mobile devices in work, school and leisure (Eurostat 2014).  As a result, young people are considered to be \"digital natives\" but they are neither digitally literate nor adequately prepared to deal with the emotional challenges of social media as they begin to chase \"likes\" and positive comments to their posts. They may feel pressure to be constantly connected and worry about their online image as their social interactions become more complex.  Following unrealistic lifestyles on social media creates a double-edged sword making young people feel inadequate and self-conscious about their online image whilst they face rising cyber-bullying.  Free and ready access to the internet has created a huge increase in unreliable information for young people and a lack of critical thinking is reinforcing stereotypes, inciting hate speech and increasing bullying, prejudice and xenophobia.\r\n\r\nSMART objectives of BEAT IT! are  as follows:\r\nObjective 1 To improve critical thinking skills\r\nObjective 2 To improve communication skills\r\nObjective 3  To improve competences in creativity in digital media\r\nObjective 4  To improve collaboration using digital tools\r\n\r\nDisabled people from each organisation will bring accompanying persons who will provide support to the participants and will lead some activities during the different exchanges.

In accord with the 2017 Youth Action programme the project will promote the values of diversity, human rights, intercultural dialogue and tolerance whilst enhancing media literacy, critical thinking and a sense of initiative.  This inclusive project will give priority to people with the obstacle of fewer opportunities including young disabled people and people who have a lived experience of bullying, intolerance and prejudice in order to be able to fully address the issues of e-safety, the lack of digital literacy and appropriate use of social media amongst young people.

No comparable EQF-compatible framework for martial arts coach education and accreditation currently exists. As an unusually diverse and adaptable group of movement forms, the martial arts offer popular contexts for engaging and supporting the healthy development of persons with a disability. A supplementary goal is to increase access of persons with a disability to self-defence learning experiences, an important outcome in light of evidence that persons with a disability are often targets for violent crime, including homicide, assault, rape, and robbery across Europe.Specifically, this proposed programme seeks to develop, trial and implement a coaching framework for coaches of the martial arts working with disabled people. The project aims to build on the evidence demonstrating the importance of coaching quality in promoting positive sporting experiences. It would ground the new framework on the lived experiences of disabled people (both those who have and have not experienced martial arts instruction), a strong understanding of national and Europe-wide policy and legal expectations for coach education, and interactive web technology.The PRIME partnership is a unique consortium of international agencies, organisations representing a range of martial arts styles, and from different EU Member States.
