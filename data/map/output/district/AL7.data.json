The technological objective of NEUWalk is to develop novel microtechnology, microelectronics, brain decoding algorithms and smart control interfaces that can be flexibly assembled to address neurobiomedical issues that not only impact the quality of life in thousands of individuals throughout Europe, but also create a significant economic burden for European countries. These innovative neurotechnologies will be combined to achieve an integrated cortico-spinal neuroprosthetic interface. The underlying objective in NEUWalk is to restore motor functions in individuals with severe spinal cord injury (SCI) and to establish a more efficient, less invasive and safer strategy to alleviate Parkinson's disease (PD) syndromes. To achieve this ambitious goal, we will capitalize on recent breakthroughs that demonstrate the impressive capacity of spinal cord stimulations to promote the recovery of full weight bearing walking in paralyzed SCI rats and to alleviate severe Parkinsonian symptoms in rodents. Elaboration and validation of the NEUWalk concept will be carried out in rats with SCI and non-human primates with PD. To accelerate the translation towards efficient clinical therapies, preliminary testing will be conducted in humans with SCI. The potential impact of the microtechnology, microelectronics, and treatment paradigms developed in NEUWalk is tremendous. These advances will open avenues for revolutionary clinical applications and will contribute to fill the increasingly wider gap that separates European research on Neuroprosthetics to similar studies conducted in the United States. Beyond SCI and PD, the NEUWalk concepts will fertilize new designs for the treatment of other neurologic disorders.", 197921.0, 9504537.0, 6, 13, "NEUWalk", null, null, null, "fp7_95307_989382056"]]}}, "1EW": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2017, "Regionalisierung, Nationalisierung und Internationalisierung von Unternehmen II", "Atech Ltd.", 33384.0, 5, 13, "This project is suited for trainees as industrial clerks or trainees in wholesale and foreign trade with the additional qualification \u201cEuropean Business Management with foreign languages\u201c in the area of the Chamber of Commerce \u201dS\u00fcdlicher Oberrhein\u201d. An integral part of the training is an internship in a company in another European country which is supposed to last several weeks. As many trainees as possible will take part in the Erasmus+ project in their second year of training. Some companies already have partners with whom they exchange workers frequently outside Europe and therefore do not participate in this project.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce considers an internship lasting several weeks as a prerequisite to achieve the additional qualification \u201cEuropean Business Management\u201c. This experience as an intern in another European country is essential for the course \u201cEuropean Business Administration and Economics\u201d as part of their curriculum.\r\nTheoretical knowledge gained during the first two years of study will be improved by gaining practical working experience.\r\nDifferent consumer types, product and assortment strategies, market communication strategies, service and price strategies (as in unit 4.3 of the curriculum) should be experienced and put to the test during the internship. \r\nOther topics, which will be experienced first-hand and then reassessed after being thoroughly prepared in the lessons, are personnel quality management (curriculum unit 3.3) and the difficulty of acknowledging different training qualifications (curriculum unit 3.6). \r\nThese issues should be dealt with within the topic \u201ccontinued education in companies\u201d. \r\nThe curriculum explicitly asks for an internship in a foreign country for the trainees: \u201cEuropean exchange programmes for young employees\u201d and \u201coptions for an internship abroad\u201d should be shown and discussed according to curriculum unit 3.7. \r\nIn general the trainees should have acquired high intercultural and social skills during their training, which should enable them to deal with European business partners adequately and competently. \r\nThis can be best achieved by doing an internship of considerable length abroad. \r\nOne goal is to enhance their personal experience, language skills and knowledge in their field of business and with respect to the curriculum. Another very important goal is to share the gained experience with the other trainees of this programme. From July to October 2017 the trainees should do their internship in different EU-countries. To gain an even wider picture it is important that as many participants as possible go to different places to gather different insights and share those with their classmates once they are back in school for their final year.
