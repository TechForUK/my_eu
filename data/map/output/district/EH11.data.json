To strive to increase an interest in the learning and implementation of languages with the intention to enable students to reach a higher level of confidence and find new perspectives on the world around us. This will support the idea of active citizenship in Europe equipping learners with skills and attitudes necessary for personal fulfillment and  vocational development also gathering the benefits of modern and inovative techniques.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n\r\n We aim to decrease the number of students who terminate their studies before completion. By changing their attitude to education through internationalization, students would thereby be encouraged  to fulfill their studies. This presupposes that in order to reach our goal an increasing number of teachers from the different national programmes should be given the opportunity of exchanging experience with colleagues from other countries.  Also to extend their competence though participating in language courses and keep abreast  of changes in life and society, educational systems and language development. To gain a variety of new  teaching ideas and improve/perfect their language skills.\r\n\r\nParticipants:\r\n\r\nTeachers will participate in international study programmes as well as job shadowing. We will reach our set goals when teachers increase their knowledge through recent research on education  and exchanging ideas with colleagues from other countries.\r\n\r\nDescription of activities and methodology: Our global world requires our students to find motivation to communicate in English as the labor market has been widely extended. Our teachers should provide the motivation and inspiration which will eventually lead to a more qualified education and better results for the students.  Furthermore this will give our school a decidedly more powerful position in the competitive situation between schools today. Consequently the teachers need to be updated on the latest educational developments of the English language. Teachers should be provided  with teaching ideas and be given the opportunity to practice designing activities for classroom activities  relating to different aspects of Life in Britain Today (e.g. youth culture, popular culture, the media, politics).\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits: \r\n\r\nTo achieve a  deeper knowledge regarding similarities and differences in educational issues,  overall subjects and be given the opportunity of exchanging experience  and ideas  as well as to develop links with teachers from other European countries. Internationalization should permeate the intercultural education of our school through teachers sharing newly gained competence and learning skills with colleagues. This will  benefit our school in a longer term perspective resulting in an enrichment through a greater understanding of  different cultures.\r\n\r\nWe strive to reach harmony in our goals for a sustainable development of our school and society in accordance with other learning institutions in Europe not only on the social level in reference to the multicultural school  environment. Furthermore from an environemental perspective we should constantly take a stand to issues of climactic nature and take precautionary measure as to preserving our resources.

As a result, the students' prepardness and awareness of linguistic, cultural, cognitive and social factors contributing to successful employability outside their home country will improve. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt local, regional and national level, the aim of the project is to continue testing and implementing the ECVET-system into the international practices of Salpaus Further Education. The aims are to; 1. specify exactly the content and learning outcomes of each OJL and study period - in terms of knowledge, skills and competence -, 2. further develop the assessment of the achieved learning outcomes and, 3. further develop the processes of recognition and validation of learning outcomes achieved abroad during OJL or studying period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt an organisational level, this project will benefit both the students and staff of Salpaus in developing the international school concept; the preparatory course for international learning periods will be offered as a voluntary course for all students and obligatory for those going abroad. The learning outcomes of European and international placements will be shared in workshops, classes and tutorials for disseminating the new techiques, latest machinery, equipment and tools, new learning environments and arrangements for learning, in addition to the personal portfolio, blog, learning diary and Mobility Tool report.

All the participants will be experienced youth leaders involved with work on political and social participation in their local communities, including participants with fewer opportunities. The main objective of the training course is to educate youth workers in the method of legislative theatre, which they can later apply and disseminate in their local communities, thus becoming multipliers of this method. Legislative theatre is a special branch in TO dealing with the process of legislation itself. I.e. it aims to present and educate deprivileged groups in the mechanisms of the legislation process, thus empowering them to influence this very process and implement a legislation which is more favourable to them. Europe today is facing an erosion in political participation, especially among youth since young people often feel that their voice does not count and their engagement does not bring any results. This results in the political passivisation of youth. Legislative theatre aims to change this. It gives (young) people the knowledge and skills to affect political and legislative processes and attain concrete changes in their political reality. The course will bring together experts and participants with different backgrounds from diverse fields of social activism, youth work, legislative processes etc., in order to allow for a sinergy and exchange of ideas and working methods and to enable participants to further disseminate these approach in their local communities. \r\n\r\nThe long-term goals of the project are to prolong international cooperation among participating partners in future projects aiming to develop legislative theatre as a form of youth work; to positively influence the area of active citizenship; and to explore new possibilities of increasing the participation of youth in decision-making processes in society at the local, state and international levels and to promote better understanding of the social, cultural and legal diversity of the participants in order to build a common European identity.", "http://www.activeinquiry.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-SI02-KA105-013040_2"], ["4DE", "Focus on Skills, Competence and Quality Assurance in Mobility", "Edinburgh College", 69422.0, "FOSC III for Quality Assurance in European placements offers students in vocational education and training opportunities to learn core competence and life long learning skills in an integrated manner to bring out the full potential in professional growth of each student.

Europe has largely become one area of work and young people finishing their studies are eager for the opportunity to live and work around the world, to gain diverse experience and learn about new cultures that will in turn enrich their native societies.\r\nThe objectives of this mobility project are to give students at TCR the opportunity to finish part of their vocational training at companies abroad, or to study at schools in other countries and gain valuable experience. The cornerstone of vocational education is the vocational training that students receive as apprentices with various firms and companies. The situation in many vocational fields remains difficult in Iceland and students have had problems finding apprenticeships. This is especially true of art and design related fields such as dressmaking, tailoring, upholstery and cabinet making. Vocational training taken abroad is fully credited at TCR and great care is taken to ensure that the companies TCR students train with are fully qualified. It is important for our small nation to keep up with the development of education and industry, and students receiving vocational training abroad return home with invaluable knowledge and experience that benefits our schools and job market. \r\nIn this mobility, 14 students have applied for grants to do their vocational training abroad or attend trade related courses for one to six months, with companies in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Lithuania and Italy (see Appendix 1).\r\nStudy trips for groups of students serve to introduce to them the opportunities available in working and studying abroad. Vocational studies in Iceland are not at university level but in certain trades students can complete the first year of university studies in Iceland and finish them with top-up degrees abroad. TCR emphasizes collaboration with schools in other European countries, making sure to keep students informed of the possibilities of studying abroad and encouraging them to make use of the possibilities. On their return students give presentations about their trips to teachers and other students  and lately, video presentations have gained popularity with the students which has led to an increased interest among other students. \r\nGetting to know how study programs for specializations in certified trades are set up and carried out in other countries offers students a valuable experience and after going on group trips former students of TCR say that they gained confidence and courage to apply for work or schools abroad. In the spring term of 2018 graduated students of TCR are studying at schools they visited on their trips and others are applying for work with companies they visited with their groups. \r\nThis application is for groups of students to go on 14-day study trips or courses with accompanying teachers. Previous trips have shown that student groups are received in a different manner when accompanied by teachers, and students have therefore requested to be accompanied by teachers during the first few days of their trips. During and after group trips students are expected to do projects that are a part of their final grades.\r\nThis application is for 11 student groups to go on14-day trips, a total of 89 students and 11 teachers.\r\nThe opportunity to get to know how study programs for specializations in certified trades are set up and carried out in schools abroad is invaluable for teachers. Many of the schools to which visits are planned are larger and offer a wider range of study programs than Icelandic schools. TCR is constantly looking to increase the range of study programs that meet the needs and expectations of new students as well as the job market. The study programs and courses at TCR are in constant development to ensure that students are ready for the requirements of the international job market when they complete their studies. Schools from other countries have also been very interested in visiting TCR to work on collaboration and student exchange. By visiting schools abroad teachers and the staff of TCR get a better and deeper insight into their operations before sending students abroad to study. \r\nThe grant application includes an application for grants to 16 members of staff for 5-day trips.\r\nPast trips have made a great contribution to school work, and as an example, the project manager of studies and two students at the School of Web development recently received recognition for their work, the project manager for the development of studies in web development and the students for their work in web design. The project manager says that the cooperation with KEA has been fundamental and important to the development of the program.", "http://www.edinburghcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IS01-KA116-038732_13"], ["2JY", "LegiLAB 4 Progress", "Active Inquiry Community Interest Company", 51961.0, "The main intent behind the LegiLAB project is to search for political involvment (mostly of young people) in Europe, their interests and ways of communicating with decision makers. All four partner organisations \u2013 Giolli (Italy), Active Inquiry (Scotland), Dobra Wola (Poland) and Pekarna Magdalenske mre\u017ee (Slovenia) are working according to the method of Theatre of the Oppressed with diverse target groups and young people. Legislative Theatre is a very important, but seldomly applied technique, which is strongly connected to communication with decision makers is. It is one of the techniques of Theatre of the Oppressed, also called theatre for social change in which the main roles are reserved for those who are usually not heard and not empowered. Our starting-point is that it was easier to engage the public to achieve social change and change of legislation in the time of Boal's original invention of this technique (the 1960s) as it is today in the so-called democratic Europe of the 21st century.\r\nThis is why we are undertaking the research and implementation of the applied project LegiLAB 4 Progress in which we will exchange examples of good practice in the field of Legislative Theatre, compare political involvement and communication with decision makers and produce two intellectual outputs: a booklet and a film in which we will give voice to the young, who are usually excluded from the processes of decision making, and enable them to be 'heard'. The common thread of both will be a discussion of the possibilities young people nowadays have to establish political participation as compared to the times when the technique of Legislative Theatre was invented. In a 20-minute film we intend to present Legislative Theatre as a method of youth work for encouraging political participation of young people. It is a new tool for youth and youth workers who are looking for ways and means of working in this area. The booklet will present expert articles on Legislative Theatre and Theatre of the Oppressed, examples of good practice in the field and articles on political participation of youth in Europe. By comparative analysis of the state of political participation of youth in the countries of participating organisations we will gain insight into the ways of social engagement of youth in individual countries and thus allow for transferring good practices elsewhere.\r\nThe project will last for 15 months, from June 2017 until September 2018. During this period each of the organisations will develop its own form of Legislative Theatre in its country and local environment, while at the same time exchanging their results on four international meetings that will take place in each of the respective countries. Here we will also conceive and process the results gained together. The conclusion of the project will be a multiplicative international event that will take place in September 2018 under the auspices of the applicant organisation in Maribor, Slovenia, where both of the intellectual outputs will be presented. It is important to emphasize that the film and booklet will be freely accessible to the general public and the youth sector, as they will both be published and accessible on the internet by which we intend to assure further dissemination of the results of the projects in the years after its conclusion.", "http://www.activeinquiry.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SI02-KA205-014103_1"], ["4DE", "Between yesterday and tomorrow", "Edinburgh College", 122129.0, "In this project 7 schools are working together, 6 of them finished a highly efficient and successful project in 2014.  Romania is a new partner selected for the reason that they have many affected children facing the danger of social exclusion and early school leaving.\r\n\r\nDue to the very challenging circumstances all the partnerschools are dealing with, all the schools have numerous learners with disadvantaged backgrounds. (Marriotts' school and Ipsia Cattaneo: situated in urban problem zones, Zespol Szkol Elektronicznych i Ogolnoksztalcacych, Przemysl and \u015ecoala Gimnazial\u0103 \u015eura Mic\u0103: situated in remote areas, Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Secundaria Abyla, Ceuta: situated in a peripheral region, Edinburgh college and Leksands Kommun Sammilsdalskolan: cultural differences integrating many immigrants and refugees.) During the last project (www.gfgm2012.com), the topics of resilience, good practices to face impacts of trauma in the daily school life were already identified as important for all partners. A brochure about trauma and school was written by two partner schools and disseminated among all partners. It turned out that all partners have their special knowledge, competences and sensitivity to the topic. Therefore, we came along to choose \"trauma and school\" as the main topic to head together to new solutions and good practices dealing with afflicted and even traumatised students. \r\n\r\nWe have split our project in a strategic and a teaching level. The strategic level consists of the topic \"trauma and school\" and addresses teachers, heads of schools, social workers, that means experts in a pedacogical field.\r\nOn the strategic level, the title \"YESTERMORROW\" makes understandable that the past of our students has an impact on their future. With a present where the new knowledge how to meet with traumatised and impaired students is applied we can increase their chances for a better 'tomorrow'. This knowledge is based on the new technology of functional brain imaging and neurobiological science. The integration of neurobiological science in the pedagogic daily life makes our project highly innovative and applicable to all schools. The adaption of the brochure to new tendences, the publishing of good practices on our project-website will disseminate our outcomes among teachers and social workers. We are convinced that it will help to reduce ESL and contribute to the development of a European Area of Skills and Qualifications. \r\n\r\n\"YESTERMORROW\" on the teaching levels means including mainly the subject history (= yesterday) and the subject ICT, maths (=tomorrow) to enable our students to improve their basic and advanced skills. Integrating the gained knowledge about trauma in the didactic approach by teachers we will enhance better skills even with weak learners. The method of project based learning and peer-learning will help to adapt to the skills of all students and challenge good learners too. These outputs will be disseminated on Wiki platform linked to our project website and is accessible by everyone. The teaching experiences will give us interesting inputs about the efficiency of our methodology. That means that the horizontal strategic and teaching levels are vertically linked in both directions.\r\n\r\nOur new Partnership YESTERMORROW is built mainly with partners with whom we have already carried out project activities successfully.  (See the website of our previous project: www.gfgm2012.com).  Therefore the partners in the project have already tested their capacity of planning and management of the agreed activities, the habit of working together, their intercultural approach, the possibility of working on teaching methodologies that will be shared and that will become shared contents. We know and will apply effective methods of evaluation to stick to the agreed content and to get the best value possible for everyone. Disseminating our outputs results will be a main issue of our work.\r\n\r\nThe longer term benefits for the schools and countries involved as well as Europe as a whole are evident. Our outputs (the brochure, cases with objects, videos on youtube, collection of good practices, etc. everything translated in different languages) will help integrating children with learning difficulties, with emotional behavioural and social difficulties. That means that the pedagogical skills of the involved teachers must be raised and the often tabooed topic \"trauma\" and \"traumatised children\" have to be priorised. Our outputs help to do this in an efficient and effective way.\r\n\r\nIn addition to child maltreatment which occurs in families we face a world where so many people are displaced (more than after World War II) where war is threatening people within Europe which can traumatise them. That means we have to work on methods to improve mental health and resilience in a scolar environment too.", "http://www.edinburghcollege.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-SE01-KA219-012259_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "EH11"}
