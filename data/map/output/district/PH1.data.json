However, although technology is not yet fully matured and ready for wide commercialisation,  a large demonstration project will facilitate the market up-take of electric buses in Europe. Furthermore, as unambiguous and extensive information about overall effects of electrified bus systems and related needs for changes on infrastructure do not exist today, UITP sees its objectives and those matching perfectly, and this led UITP to build a consortium of 40 partners, who were already considering their actions along this theme, and to collectively design the 42-months demonstration project ZeEUS \u2013 Zero-Emission Urban Bus Systems.\n\nZeEUS project focus on the today's challenge in the electrification of bus system, the extension of the fully-electric solution to a wider part of the urban network. This goes through the development of electric vehicles of large capacity, and the creation of an infrastructure capable of providing the required charging energy, operated according to non-disruptive and grid-balancing principles.\n\nThe ZeEUS project will cover innovative electric bus solutions with different types of electrical power-train systems.

In consequence certification by the regulation authorities is restrictive.\nIn order to implement robust and reliable quality assurance procedures for adhesive bonding, the main objective of ENCOMB (Extended Non-Destructive Testing for Composite Bonds) is the identification, development and adaptation of methods suitable for the assessment of the adhesive bond quality. Since the performance of adhesive bonds depends on the physico-chemical properties of adherend surfaces and adhesives, testing methods for adhesive and adherend surface characterisation will also be developed.\nThe implementation of reliable adhesive bonding processes by advanced quality assurance will lead to an increased use of light-weight composite materials for highly integrated structures minimising rivet based assembly. The expected weight savings for the fuselage airframe are up to 15 %. These weight savings will have further effects on the size and weight of the engines.

The physicochemical properties are affected by a variety of factors, e.g. the degree of contamination, curing parameters, ageing or the activation after surface pre-treatment.\n\nTherefore, one of the ENCOMB project objectives was the adaptation of methods for characterisation of adhered surfaces before application of the adhesive. The second challenging goal was the development of techniques for evaluating the bonded components. Scientists defined this newly developed quality assurance technology as extended NDT (ENDT).\n\nFirstly, the most representative aeronautic application scenarios were identified. Suitable specimens were developed  and characterised using ENDT methods. The results were compared with those of a variety of conventional analytical methods and mechanical testing to evaluate their suitability for the specific measurement tasks.\n\nAmong others, researchers applied optical methods like laser scanning vibrometry, active thermography and a wetting test to characterise the state of adhered surfaces. Sensor-based techniques such as embedded optical fibre sensors or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also tested as well as laser-excited and non-linear ultrasonic techniques.\n\nIn total, 31 ENDT technologies were tested for the assessment of adhered surfaces and the evaluation of adhesive bonds.

Both teachers main language knowledge comes from their individual secondary education which is 10yrs/20yrs ago. One of the participants gained a Scottish higher in French, the other a Scottish O'Grade as well as attending evening MLPS course run by the Local Authority.   Both participants after attending the Course will support staff as well as school development of teaching and learning of French throughout the school which will aid the implementation of the Scottish Government1+2 strategy which is being introduced nationally throughout Scottish schools in the academic year 2014/15. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will develop relationships with teachers in other European countries to raise awareness of European culture within the school and wider local community.  In collaboration with these partners abroad it is expected to provide opportunities for pupils using internet and ICT platforms to engage with other learners abroad which promotes embedding learning French in a holistic, ad hoc way encompassing European culture as well as language aspects in their learning.  It is expected that these 'real-life' learning experiences for pupils will aid promotion in the development of a European identity for our learners. \r\n\r\nParticipants attending the Course will also support colleagues throughout the school in developing their competence in language knowledge as well as in their teaching of  French through sharing ideas and resources they have gained from attending the Immersion course which will be shared through collegiate sessions.  The opportunity for participants to visit a  local school in France will provide a valuable insight for both teachers to see good practice first-hand as well as gaining knowledge of the French education system. \r\n\r\n An Information evening for parents will be arranged during the school year by teaching staff as a way of communicating with parents about the Scottish Government 1+2 strategy but also as a way of identifying ways that they can support their own children at home through accessing a variety of online resources which will be made available to them at both local (school/Local Authority website) and at national levels ( Education Scotland website).

One of our educational focuses lies on teaching modern languages. For years, we have been networking with other European schools organising a high number of well-established student exchanges, hosting exchange students or sending our students abroad individually and within the framework of study trips to various European countries. In order to establish these relations even more and in order to prepare our students for a working life that is based more and more on international relations, we would very much like to participate in the programme of Learning Mobility of Individuals. \r\nIt is our aim to enable teachers of various subjects and with varying professional experience to participate in this programme in order to get the highest outcome. Consequently, our teachers serve as examples for our students by establishing and maintaining international relations. Thus, we set an example of European interaction to our students.\r\nIt is important for us to boost general education, skills and employability. Additionally we place great importance on mobility, an essential  quality in the context of our students' future, which might involve \"Youth on the move\". We want to raise their awareness for multilingualism, life-long learning as well as social cohesion and solidarity in a modern Europe fit for the future.\r\n\r\nThe participating teachers and social education workers are looking forward to getting to know not only other European educational systems practically and first-hand, but also other methods of structuring educational processes. Moreover, they want to seize the opportunity to undertake various advanced vocational trainings on teaching and educating students as well as vocational trainings on cultural awareness and language skills. Studying abroad offers the possibility to expand our language teachers\u2019 knowledge. Furthermore, it is the best way to get into touch with native speakers to establish and maintain bilateral relations. Our social education workers regard an educational training abroad as a valuable means to develop their professional and personal skills. Thus, they can contribute substantially to our school culture. Based on Europe 2020 we selected our activities abroad, which comprise job shadowing, educational training and language courses. All the activities enhance key competences, transnational learning and mobility of all the participants. Thus the participating teachers can convincingly and authentically enable our students to enter the job market or continue their further education and meet the challenges of the future. \r\nAll in all, the programme Learning Mobility of Individuals offers the possibility to enhance the quality of our education \u2013 be it social or professional education. Additionally, it is a great opportunity to get an insight into other methods of teaching, to establish and improve our cultural awareness and to gain experience in the field of applying modern technologies profitably in the classroom. Thus we contribute to our students' equality of opportunities. We hope to reduce the number of early school leavers and to increase the number of students completing third level education (cf. \"Agenda for new skills and jobs\").\r\nBeing one of the first so-called media schools (Medienreferenzschule) in Bavaria, modern technology in the classroom is of great significance for us. Smart growth in Europe focuses mainly on modern information and communication technology in a digital society. It is all the more important to provide the teachers with the relevant skills to fulfil this task adequately.\r\nThe follow-up and dissemination of all knowledge and experiences gained includes both, extracurricular staff meetings and teacher trainings to pass it on as well as the application in our daily lessons and educational work in the full-time day school. Moreover, all  knowledge and experiences gained will positively contribute to our already existing European relations. Members of the school administration, the computer systems supervisor and our social education workers will likewise benefit from the insight into other European edcuational methods and (technology) systems. \r\nAll in all, every single training will strengthen our school culture. It is of high importance to us to enable our students to become self-confident and sophisticated personalities who are interested in steering our globalised world and who are capable of using all the opportunities Europe has to offer. Our teachers already use these bonds and opportunities. Consequently, they serve as an example to convey the European spirit to our students. Our aims are to facilitate the transition from school education to the job market, to tackle youth unemployment, to teach key competences and life-long learning and to guarantee equality of opportunities.

Only teachers with a high language competence can run CLIL-lessons, only teachers with high language competence can set up a learning environment that challenges the pupils to use English as a medium of instruction and communication. Therefore we need to qualify our teachers in terms of language competence as well as in methodology and didactics.

Internationalization is therefore embedded in the organization. Nimeto Utrecht is searching for more anchors points abroad to connect with. This concerns internships for individual students, as well as collaboration projects or exchange programs with partner schools abroad. The project Internship Abroad 2 caters to both students and employees who wish to do an internship abroad for a certain period of time. With the aid of Erasmus+ funding, an increasing number of students and employees will become eligible for internship experiences in Europe, regardless of their financial situations.\r\n \r\nDuring the project Internship Abroad 2, 12 students will be able to do a 5-month professional internship at a company in Europe. Compared to last year, this would mean that the number of students participating in an internship abroad has doubled, supporting the objectives of the internationalization policy. The project also offers 4 employees a possibility to acquire knowledge and experience at an educational institution in Europe for a period of at least 2 weeks. The optional component Internationalization II supports this development.   Especially for the benefit of students and employees participating in European internships, Nimeto Utrecht has given one of its employees the responsibility to coordinate all activities involved in the project Internship Abroad 2 and work closely with the department for business contacts and the business coordinators who are responsible for the internships.   By participating in education and/or doing an internship abroad, students and employees of Nimeto Utrecht will become acquainted with different cultures, have new experiences and broaden their horizons. An internship abroad will lead to additional challenges as well as motivated students and employees. An internship abroad will also lead to more in-depth knowledge and experience within a particular field of expertise, professional insights and a better understanding of differences in European cultures, education and work environments. \r\n\r\nStudents will experience enormous personal growth by doing projects abroad. It will turn them into world citizens, make them more mobile and help them expand their network and increase their chances on the European job market. Students with experience abroad also set a good example for other (future) students. With their newly acquired experience and knowledge they will have a positive influence on their peers.   Because our employees maintain contacts with international educators, trade organizations and partner schools abroad, the quality of education is enriched with new educational ideas, curriculum possibilities, organizational structures and a broader outlook on education and fields of expertise in Europe.   The impact of an experience abroad on students, employees and the organization is invaluable. Both internally and externally, we will communicate this added value with our stakeholders: future students, parents, business relations and governmental organizations.", "http://www.paintycait.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA102-038771_1"], ["2NX", "Movilidades Erasmus+ FP Castilla y Le\u00f3n B\u00e1sica y Grado Medio", "Perth College UHI", 421028.0, "The regional mobility Consortium \u201cMovilidades Erasmus+ FP Castilla y Le\u00f3n B\u00e1sica y Grado Medio\u201d aims at the management, development and implementation of mobility for students and teachers from VET providers offering Basic or Intermediate VET diploma programmes in the Education System.

This project is designed to place ICT and specifically Geo-media at the heart of the project. An overarching objective is to develop a framework to enable collaborative studies of environmental issues with outputs fully embedded in the digital age. Atlantic salmon are found throughout the bio-region of the North Atlantic. They inhabit the rivers and seas of a significant number of European countries within their range. As they are a migratory species, they therefore face an array of environmental pressures. The studying of Atlantic salmon acts as a catalyst to investigate these numerous environmental problems in the fields of sustainable food production, ecotourism, renewable energy, pollution, agricultural impact, forestry, ecosystem management, fishery management, conservation methods and most notably climate change. Each partner country within the project presents a different perspective to study these issues. This opportunity has enabled the development of  4 distinct themes; (a)The value of Atlantic salmon.(b)A comparison between Baltic and Atlantic salmon.(c)The southern range of the Atlantic Salmon.(d) Industry and Atlantic Salmon. The project will provide 78 students aged 16 to 18 years, from the UK, Finland, France, Germany and Greenland an opportunity to participate. The students are from a range of socio-economic backgrounds. A variety of methods will be used to deliver the project aims. These will include field trips, collection of environmental data, workshops and seminars all of which are underpinned by an inquiry-based learning approach. The project outputs by the students will be collaborative in nature and consist of video presentations incorporated into Geo-media applications. The methodology used, will foster relationships between schools and established conservation communities. The project will make full use of social media as a means of dissemination and also to promote future engagement by schools not involved in this project. This will be done be enabling contributions by other schools to the Geo-media outputs as well as inclusion in the ongoing eTwinning project. Such an approach ensures a sustainable legacy of the project results.This project provides an opportunity to engage young people in science and environmental learning in an innovative way. It also provides a route to increasing skills for life and skills for life long learning.
