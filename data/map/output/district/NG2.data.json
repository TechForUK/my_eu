More European countries are emphasising the importance of making visible and valuing learning that takes place outside formal education and training institutions, for example at work, in leisure time activities and at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, despite a number of initiatives and recommendations on the recognition of informal learning (c.f. European guidelines for validating non\u2011formal and informal learning, CEDEFOP) there is a wide gap between the recognition of formal and informal or non-formal learning. Access to the recognition of informal learning is patchy and the outcome of recognition process is  too often treated with suspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mozilla Open Badges, an initiative launched by the Mozilla Foundation in September 2011, provides a response to the needs for the recognition (formal and informal) of learning (formal and informal).  Open Badges are portable and verifiable, allowing learners to showcase work, document skill sets and competencies, and create a robust portrait of their abilities wherever they were acquired: whether in school, in the community, on the job or online. Millions of badges have already been delivered and the initiative has received the support from leading organisations in the field of education, business, policy and citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aims and objectives of Badge Europe, BEU (pronounced \u201cBe You\u201d) are to exploit the benefits of Open Badges to:\r\n\r\n- To create the conditions for a Europe-wide and world-wide recognition of learning achievements;\r\n\r\n- To open and facilitate the systematic access to the recognition of non-formal and informal learning;\r\n\r\n- To place formal and informal recognition of learning on a par; \r\n\r\n- To create new employment and learning opportunities for all; and\r\n\r\n- To bring a European contribution to the leadership of the world-wide Open Badge movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nBEU will be developing a network of organisations and practitioners to: \r\n\r\n- Promote the use of Open Badges for the recognition of learning;\r\n\r\n- Develop Open Badge initiatives at institutional/local/city/regional/national levels (e.g. Cities of Learning, developing the example of Chicago Summer of Learning - http://explorechi.org);\r\n\r\n- Promote Open Badges at policy levels;\r\n\r\n- Develop innovative practices in learning and employment; and\r\n\r\n- Make recommendations and implement improvements to the Open Badge Infrastructure, technologies and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose activities will be carried out directly, with the support of Open Workshops (6) and of a MOOC. (Massive Open Online Course )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTCOMES\r\n\r\nThe main outcomes of the project are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Developing a trustworthy infrastructure to increase job market fluidity and a seamless environment for the recognition of individual skills to full qualifications;\r\n\r\n- A European Open Badge Network led by a steering committee composed of associate partners to contribute to the outcomes of the project and prepare its self-sustainability;\r\n\r\n- A dynamic Inventory of Open Badge Initiatives and resources;\r\n\r\n- A series of guidelines, green, white and discussion papers on Open Badges for Individuals, Open Badges for Organisations, Open Badges in Territories, Open Badges and Quality management and Open Badges and Policies;\r\n\r\n- Guidelines for bridging ECTS/ECVET/Europass documents with Open Badges;\r\n\r\n- Recommendations for the improvement of Open Badge Infrastructure, technologies and services;\r\n\r\n- A Research Report on Open Badge Implementations;\r\n\r\n- A Community Portal, bimonthly Newsletter and regular webcasts; and\r\n\r\n- A series of Open Workshops and a MOOC;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPECTED IMPACT\r\n\r\n- Empower individuals to make their competencies and talents visible;\r\n\r\n- Empower teachers with the means to challenge traditional assessment models;\r\n\r\n- Provide early school leavers with the possibility to have their competencies recognised and further developed in a setting more appropriate to their goals, styles and desires (self-study, home schooling, school of second chance, apprenticeship, etc.);\r\n\r\n- Recognise the competencies acquired at work into a currency that is valuable on the job market;\r\n\r\n- Increase transparency and establish trusted communication between employers, jobseekers and education providers;\r\n\r\n- Increase the confidence of adults to participate in lifelong learning by providing a simple and straightforward mechanism to have one\u2019s current competencies recognised, as a foundation for further learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG TERM BENEFITS\r\n\r\nThe long term benefits are a more inclusive learning provision, a more open employment market and an increased trust in the data relative to individual achievements (CVs, diploma transcripts, etc.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS\r\n\r\nBeuth-Hochschule fuer Technik Berlin (Germany) Coordinator\r\n\r\nCambridge Professional Development (UK)\r\n\r\nADPIOS (France)\r\n\r\nEDEN (UK/Europe)\r\n\r\nDiscendum Oy (Finland)\r\n\r\nDienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (The Netherlands)\r\n\r\nRadom Institute (Poland)\r\n\r\nDigitalme (UK)\r\n\r\nARTES (Italy)", "http://www.camprof.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DE01-KA200-000675_8"], ["6EN", "Increasing SME Apprenticeship Engagement", "NGi (UK) Limited", 271477.0, "To combat youth unemployment the European Union and its member states are using apprenticeships as a solution. Public money is being used to encourage employers to invest in young people as apprentices. For employers however, it is not a level playing field the barriers for micro, small and medium sized enterprises are significant and prevent them from taking on apprentices. In the UK less than 10% of SMEs will take on an apprentice compared to a third of large companies who will do so. Given that the consensus, amongst academic studies and labour market experts is that  growth in employment will come from SMEs, there is a danger that these business organisations will not engage with apprenticeships and public investment will not be as effective as it could be.\r\n\r\nThis is what the project will seek to address, it will take good practice from two countries which have good records at assisting SMEs to take on an apprentice, and import this into three who wish to do better. The partnership will then continue to work at developing further innovation, so that a training programme and resources are produced that help SMEs overcome the barriers they face in apprenticeship engagement. We wish to create an easy to access, one stop shop where even the smallest of businesses have all the knowledge and skill they require to recruit an apprentice of their own.\r\n\r\nThe coordinating partner is a local authority, with a low job density, and 99.85% of businesses within it are SMEs. The vision is that by the end of this project they will have based within their Economic Development Team capacity and capability to deliver the training and officers equipped to provide the one stop service local businesses require.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this project we will have worked with 270 SMEs who will have taken on at least 1 apprentice for the first time, and a total of 360 young people will have completed or be on course to complete an apprenticeship. We will see significant increase in awareness among young people of the opportunities an apprenticeship will provide as the project will engage with 30 secondary schools in partner countries. Further, we will see a significant increase in the understanding of SMEs about the benefits of having an apprentice. An expected impact is within the regions that partners in Bulgaria, Poland and the United Kingdom operate, there will be a significant  increase in SME Apprenticeship Engagement.\r\n\r\nFinally the project will host a large UK based dissemination event hosting a minimum of 300 stakeholders, with the aim that the projects transferable outputs will be adopted elsewhere.", "http://www.ng-i.co.uk", "Gedling Borough Council", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013764_5"], ["6EN", "YouNG Goes Euro", "NGi (UK) Limited", 240039.0, "The European Union promotes entrepreneurship as a key factor for competitiveness and has highlighted the importance of advancing a European entrepreneurial culture by fostering the right mind-set and entrepreneurship-related skills.

Fighting rising levels of unemployment has become one of the most urgent tasks for European governments. Too many young people leave school prematurely and run a high risk of being unemployed. The same risk threatens high number of adult workers with low skills. One quarter of the working age population in Europe, almost 80 million people have only low or basic skills, and a great percent of them area hardly educable or trainable because of different disabilities. Activation of school drop-outs or low-qualified job seekers is a primary field of cooperation in the Public Employment Service (PES) 2020 strategy of the EU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost relevant priorities of the project are contributing to a reduction in the number of low-skilled adults (re-skilling and up-skilling) and developing partnerships between education and employment. Targeted topics are new innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses and labour market issues incl. career guidance / youth unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget groups:\r\n\r\n1. Unskilled or low-skilled disadvantaged young people and adults between 16-36, who have troubles in finishing/ taking part of trainings in the regular school system as well as of the employment centre, being mentally and/or psychologically unable to follow the usual courses. These persons are excluded from the labour market and belong therefore to a disadvantaged group in social life. Members of the target group are not mentally handicapped, but the social-economic background did not allow them to develop skills, moreover the family and social surrounding often suppresses existing skills and motivation. \r\n\r\n2.Trainers, tutors, teachers of the above mentioned group of young adults.
