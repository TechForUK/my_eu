In that way artworks become active artefacts that react on users' attention and emotions and provide more information about them! This leads to the new generation of mobile museum guides based on the novel concept we call Adaptive Augmented Reality (A2R).The realization of such an ambitious result will be based on the prior work of partners in the domain of Augmented Reality for Cultural Heritage, Affective Computing and Complex Event Processing, which ensures the quality and reliability of generated outcomes and it will be driven by the three complementary use cases from Cultural Heritage domain, which ensures the usefulness and reusability of results.Very rigorous and comprehensive evaluation and exploitation plans ensures that this work will produce exploitable research results and influence the selected research areas, as well as the usage of advance ICT in the CH domain in general.", 124709.0, 3619501.0, "ARtSENSE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_97475_974134432"]]}, "creative": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0AH", "Virtual Sets: Creating and promoting virtual sets for the performing arts", "PACIFICSTREAM ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONSCOMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY", 153403.0, "ViSet will promote cutting-edge digital technologies for the arts, in order to demonstrate the many social, economic, commercial and cultural advantages of these technologies for the arts.

Key objectives are to:\r\n(1) develop a recognised standard, curriculum, course and qualification that will give professionals an incentive to add to their knowledge and skills;\r\n(2) stimulate demand for and increase the uptake of innovation through stakeholder engagement and co-creation of course development ;\r\n(3) provide the opportunity to continuously update the curricula and standards by linking the professionals to a strong knowledge cluster.\r\n\r\nStrategic relevance: Across Europe, quadruple helix partnerships are striving to scale up smart solutions to address the demographic challenge of an ageing population. But, successful scaling of innovative solutions especially for the elderly with long-term conditions remain patchy.  The difficulty in securing health and social care professionals\u2019 engagement to utilize, help people to use and accept the adoption of assistive living technologies is a key obstacle to supporting people to live independently for longer. Partly, this is due to the shortfall of training opportunities for practitioners in assistive living technologies along with the lack of a recognised qualification for competence in their suitability and use. As a result, awareness of what assistive living technologies are available, what they can do, when they are suitable, who could benefit from them and in what way remains low amongst front line health and care workers and their managers. Moreover,  at European level, it has been recognized that there is no standard nor consensus as to what should be taught. \r\n\r\nMethods and actions: The ALTAS project intends to plug this important gap. It will develop, test and evaluate ALTAS standards, curriculum and VET course that can provide health and social care professionals with the knowledge, skills and confidence to utilise, deploy and recommend appropriate ALT devices, technologies and related services. It will also create an accreditation scheme that will be a key step on the road to a national and European- recognised accredited qualification.\r\n\r\nALTAS will be delivered in 3 phases: Design, Delivery and Evaluation. The design phase will define the standards, develop a curriculum and generate initial content for course delivery. Needs analysis and stakeholder engagement will support the development of the curriculum and alignment with specific cross-cultural and health and social care characteristics within each partner country and region will be a key principle. \r\n\r\nUsing an iterative learning methodology, the delivery phase will develop an assessment framework, build the training course with the trainers and pilot an eCourse in one region. This phase will also develop and deploy a toolkit to support training course implementation. The assessment framework will form the basis for an accredited qualification, planned to lead to European wide accreditation. In parallel the course and e-course, developed by ALTAS  training organisations, will be launched to VET trainers during a 5-day coaching session incorporating different modes of delivery.

These deliverables will be supported by an eCourse, a course deployment toolkit and a comprehensive evaluation report. The ALTAS project is expected to (1) raise awareness and increase knowledge of ALT for front-line health and social care staff and their managers, (2) increase motivation in staff to take ALT courses, (3) increase staff willingness and confidence to promote ALT, (4) increase interest in the ALT workforce to exchange and share good practice across Europe and (5) increase collaboration and cooperation between training organisations and ALT suppliers.", "http://www.liverpoolccg.nhs.uk", "NHS Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA202-013710_coordinator"], ["0AB", "Developing Adult Educators' Competences to Promote Learners' Life Style Entrepreneurship", "The Women's Organisation Ltd", 155506.0, "The project has been developed to solve the issues of low adult participation in life-long learning and high unemployment.  This project will contribute to meeting the Europe 2020 goals to increase employment rate by 75% and participation target of 15% in lifelong learning through development of the basic and specific competences of adult educators-practitioners. \r\nAccording to the data of the need analysis in European and partner countries, the following needs are addressed within the project: \r\n\u2022 To develop the basic and specific adult educators\u2019 competencies working with disadvantaged learners with focus on innovative ways of outreach and delivery of learning activities;\r\n\u2022 To provide necessary knowledge and information to adult learners with fewer opportunities and from disadvantaged background on access to adult learning services and the possibilities for employment on the basis of their lifestyle, abilities and talents.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are: \r\n1. to strengthen the competencies of adult educators-practitioners supplying them with innovative and attractive training material and ICT tools based on the Lifestyle entrepreneurship (LSE) approach;\r\n2. to enhance the professional development of adult educators by introducing the innovative education methods: blended learning, reversed/flipped training, Open education recourses (OER);\r\n3. to develop OER tailored to the needs of adult educators in order to support digital integration in learning to reach learners from disadvantaged backgrounds;\r\n4. to increase the motivation and reduce disparities in learning outcomes of adult learners with fewer opportunities and from disadvantaged backgrounds using the LSE approach and ICT tools with the long perspective of getting self-employed.\r\n\r\nTo meet the above mentioned needs and implement the objectives, the partnership will develop three intellectual outputs: \r\n1.

The project will involve 320 adult educators-practitioners, 72 disadvantaged adult learners (senior citizens, people living in remote areas, in long-term unemployment, women in social exclusion, low-skilled, etc) and 60 stakeholders.\r\nDuring the project the main activities will be implemented: developing of the curriculum and training material; creating and collecting digital stories on successful real life style entrepreneurship experiences; creating e-platform for adult educators and learners, also presenting the project outputs as OER; testing of the training material on adult educators; developing of the guidelines for adult educators how to offer LSE for disadvantaged learners and testing them on adult learners; translation of the project outputs into national languages; organizing learning/teaching activities for adult educators practitioners; dissemination and multiplication activities.\r\n\r\nThe methodology of the project is based on the blended learning approach using the reversed/ flipped training method, ICT tools, OER. The project adapts the good practices from UK to project partner countries on lifestyle businesses as a useful alternative to self-employment around their lifestyle, abilities and talents for adults with the few opportunities and from disadvantaged backgrounds. \r\nThe main impact on adult educators-practitioners is developing their competences enabling to provide qualitative adult education services using innovative teaching and learning methods to deal with different groups of disadvantaged learners (disabled people, single parents, women, senior citizens, living in remote areas, etc.). The adult educator will improve general competences, namely since of initiative and entrepreneurship, digital, social and specific competences (being an advisor/ counselor/facilitator; dealing with public relations and marketing) responding to the economical and political challenges of the 21st century. \r\nThe main impact on learners with disadvantaged background and fewer opportunities is reducing social exclusion, enrolling them in active lifelong learning activities and enabling them to be self-employed and built the business around their lifestyle activities.

The final beneficiaries targeted by the project are adult learners in non-formal education, but also students from formal education, in need of a holistic discovery of new technologies. The starting point, which motivates the project, is the fact that ICT literacy considers only a limited approach in this field. It showcases the software used in desktop applications (for future professionalizing goals), and services to citizens and consumers (for goals of citizenship and social inclusion). Other important aspects are overlooked, and important dimensions of the society's transformation by new technologies are sometimes ignored.The project aims to involve (basic) ICT trainers and teacher (and all educational staff people) in a different approach, with a wider vision of ICT emergence in our society, and a wider understanding about the way that ICT influence our culture,  our professional life and everyday life. It aims to increase the critical thinking about new technologies. It aims to act on usual educative actions about ICT, implemented by regional, national and local governments, by demonstrating its wide openness on different view angles, and its motivational virtue.The project is centered on the production of open educational resources (OERs) to be used for professional purposes in the area of ICT learning, with adults and students. These OERs are structured in: \"raw\" educational resources related to 45 learning objects in the field of programming, narratives methodologies, rich media production, and digital art ; a skills reference and validation guide; two curricula of 120 hrs each (one for ICT training for adults in non-formal education, the other for students in formal education), in 3 levels each, structured in 2 LMS platforms, including all educational resources, pedagogical informations and assessment processes.
