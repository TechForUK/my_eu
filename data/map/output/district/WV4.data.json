But E\\\\ will add another unique dimension: not only will we encourage ReIO and RoM to work together, but robot system customers and users will be involved \u2013 connecting the suppliers directly with the market. To this end, there are two innovative new pillars: the Pre-Commercial-Procurement Pilots (PCPP) and the Knowledge and Innovation Centers (KIC). The PCPP will enable public procurers to become demanding buyers of new R&D. The complete PCP process will encompass robotics R&D for the first time, resulting in, demonstrable prototypes that can be evaluated together with the process at the end. The KICs are open experimental facilities that will that allow new robot customers and users to interact with roboticists with no entrance barrier and at very low cost so that new communities can form \u2013 and radically new ideas can take shape. E\\\\'s scientific work is structured in scenarios and research foci, directly derived from the SRA.

The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan.

Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.

In Colton Hills, German students will be able to work and socialize with predominantly Asian students, together with significant numbers of students from the Caribbean and, especially with the vote for \u201cleaving the European Union- Brexit\u201d for those students at Colton Hills it is necessary to get in contact with Europe and in this case with dominantly \u201cwhite\u201d students to get out of their cultural niche.\r\nHelpsen has a student population where there are few students from ethnic groups, apart from white German. The rural communities of this area have little experience or knowledge of the diverse nationalities represented at Colton Hills, and this brings fear and anxiety. As the borders of Europe have opened within our project we aim to provide students from both schools with opportunities to challenge these attitudes and stereotypes.\r\nThe activities in our project will be in year 9 because of the high communicative competence which is needed for the deeper understanding of the partners.

In adddition the students will present new ideas they have learnt in the project what the whole school can do to prevent racism.\r\nModule 7 will be a study of political right wing parties , their ideas and what their attitude towards our project would be comparing  the party AFD in Germany and the UKIP party in the UK.\r\nAs all students in both schools in the same year group have got partners , due to our objective \u201c understanding people better by getting to know my partner\u201d the partners will interview each other about their own perspective to the modules  to then introduce the partners in their classrooms.
