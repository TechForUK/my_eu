It is one of the most variable human diseases with complex, multi-systemic and progressively worsening clinical manifestations. Despite the huge impact of DM1 on the daily life of both patients and their family members, DM1 patients fail to receive the quality of healthcare that is available as they are not assertive users of the health care system.\nThere is no cure for DM1. The aim of treatment is to relieve impairments, reduce limitations and support participation in everyday activities. Based on our DM1-specific model which shows that physical activity and experienced fatigue are main determinants of DM1 health status (Kalkman 2007), OPTIMISTIC investigates the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in combination with exercise training  to improve functional capacity and to stimulate an active lifestyle.\nOPTIMISTIC compares the outcome of a treatment regimen with regular management in a multi-centre, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial, designed to 1) result in evidence-based clinical guidelines on exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in DM1, 2) capture clinically meaningful changes in existing and novel outcome measures, and 3) identify both individual and composite biomarkers as surrogate treatment outcome measures that are reflective of the disease state.\nThere is an urgent need for an European clinical trial infrastructure for DM1. High prioritization of this is required to enhance the speed of clinical development of new putative DM1 therapeutics approaching the market. OPTIMISTIC will provide this and safeguard the rapid uptake of the developed clinical guidelines ensuring improvements in DM1 care and quality of life.", 26603.0, 3092868.0, "OPTIMISTIC", "The trials of muscular dystrophy", "For the first time ever, the EU is funding a multi-centre clinical trial in Europe to develop evidence-based clinical management guidelines for patients suffering from myotonic dystrophy type\u00a01 (DM1).", "DM1 is a form of muscular disorder affecting over 75\u00a0000 people in Europe alone. This chronic, inherited, progressive and multi-systemic disease has no cure. DM1 symptoms include severe muscle weakness and cardiovascular disorders.\n\nCurrently, treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms through exercise training and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). However, health care facilities for DM1 patients and their families are often sub-optimal as the disease is rare.\n\nThe EU-funded http://www.optimistic-dm.eu (OPTIMISTIC) project is working on improving clinical management of DM1 patients through the development of standardised outcome measures and guidelines. For this purpose, 286 patients will be recruited.\n\nBesides evaluating the efficacy of treatment intervention, efforts will also be made to identify relevant predisposing genetic factors and other potential biomarkers. Fatigue reduction and increase in physical activity will be used as outcome measures.\n\nProject members already achieved significant progress with regard to obtaining requisite approvals, CBT therapist training, harmonisation of outcome measures and developing standard operating procedures. Patient recruitment has already started and trials are in progress in three out of the four sites.\n\nOptimising interventions that combine exercise with CBT should improve patient adherence and enhance their quality of life through better mobility and reduced fatigue. This data could also be extrapolated for research and clinical care of patients suffering from other neuromuscular disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\n\nTrial outcomes will provide enough scientific proof for optimising DM1 management in the clinic. Moreover, the necessary infrastructure for faster assessment of promising putative therapies for DM1 such as antisense oligonucleotide therapies will also be established.", null, "http://www.catt-sci.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/157334.jpg", "fp7_106243_954827843"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["4NS", "Patobulinto ir alternatyvaus bendravimo ir i\u0161mani\u0173j\u0173 technologij\u0173 naudojimas ugdant speciali\u0173j\u0173 poreiki\u0173 vaikus", "Rowan Gate Primary School", 14366.0, "The school community wants to develop an international cooperation strategy and responsibly participate in activities together with partners from other EU countries seeking for educating quality of higher education of mentally retarded children with special needs (SEN students).

Each partner school has been given responsibility for organising and taking the lead on one of the activities planned. The learning activities planned for children are -- Exploring the links between electricity and sound/ Sound inventions - Science- Music powered by electricity - exploring music as a form of communication that can change the way of feelings, thinking and acting; exploring and creating sound using new technologies - ICT- Programming rhythm - ICT- Composition - write a song about sounds - Music- Music appreciation - exploring and responding to work of famous composers using electronic instruments - MusicThis project brought together different types of schools - some specialise in Special Education Needs, one is a mainstream school with designated special provision or inclusion and one school without any experience in SEN provision, though having children with learning difficulties. We wanted to compare and contrast special needs provision in different European Countries as well as share best practice, knowledge and experience. Some schools have previously been involved in Comenius Projects. Through their knowledge of eTwinning the teachers collaborated via eTwinning to plan and discuss a future project. We aim to deliver several training activities during the mobilities - Professional development is a core principle of the project as we would like teachers to observe each other when they visit schools and discuss techniques and methodologies they use.eTwinning training materials and ICT resourcesAmazing ICTKniess methodTraining in logorhythmics andScientific activity ideasDuring mobilities children and teachers will have opportunities to visit other classrooms, observe teaching strategies and engage in teaching and learning activities regardless of abilities or needs. The mobilities are also an opportunity to experience and engage with other European cultures.The project will prepare pupils for their social and professional life, by stimulating their creativity, spontaneity, ICT competencies and language skills by working in a multicultural space. By the end of this project we would like to see a progress in children's results in Science and Computing. We are hoping to see at least 10% progress in comparison with previous years. There should be an increase in children's interest, especially girls (girl's are underachieving in many European countries in Computing and Science) in studying Science and Computing through involving them into cross-curricular activities. The activities involving Music are very motivating for all the children.Parents and carers will have opportunities to be more involved and engaged in their children's life, especially in disadvantaged areas. The results of the project will be used and exploited continuously  in a long term by maintaining and  developing  after the end, for example-dissemination of training to staff who did not attend the training, -a more creative and motivating cross-curricular teaching for all children, -a greater understanding of children's individual needs, -better inclusion of all children irrespective of needs, -maintenance of the project website with additional information from schools regarding the project impact,-inclusion of the project into the curriculum to ensure learning impacts all subjects-motivated and inspired teachers who will go on to motivate and inspire others", "http://www.rowangateprimary.co.uk", "Rowan Gate Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024418_coordinator"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1AH", "BRITISH FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION*", 1080.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_18677", 2016], ["1AH", "BRITISH FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION*", 334.0, "Other management expenditure (04.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_20405", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NN8"}
