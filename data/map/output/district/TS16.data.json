No instances of true multi vehicle chargers (ie many types of vehicle/charging system on charge at the same time) were found.\nThis is due to the complexities arising around electrical harmonic interactions between vehicles under charge and the various charging methodologies. Sufficient work to define these has not been carried out and no vehicle or charger unit impact data is available over the longer term. Potential service providers face a choice between cosmetic combinations or multiple different charging stations, a costly option, low in flexibility.\nThe MultiCharge project will deliver a comprehensive picture of the harmonics between different vehicles and charging methodologies, before using software modelling to analyse the interactions and develop a Harmonic Filter to enable true multi-vehicle charging. MultiCharge replaces the active electronic module and multiple transformers present in most current EV chargers, with a single 3 phase 440 volt main passive unit comprising a zigzag auto transformer, harmonic filter, interphase transformer & rectifier block and distribution bus & control unit.\nThe project will deliver social and economic growth via increased uptake of cleaner to run, cheaper to use Electric Vehicles.\nWe will achieve this through delivery of an affordable re-charging system based upon market leader Carroll & Meynell's own technology, patented buck boost units and zigzag transformer to enable significant reductions in the cost of providing appropriate electricity supply to EV charging stations.", 35842.0, 51203.0, "MultiCharge", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_196224_952374810"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["0RD", "Daniel Challenge 2017-2018", "Taking Ground", 28536.0, "Daniel Challenge is a youth year out programme, it is a European Voluntary Service programme through Erasmus+, funded by the European Commission. Daniel Challenge involves personal development and growth through  social action and community involvement  It draws young people from across the UK, Europe and further afield between the ages of 18 -30 years, in groups of between 8 and 16 in number. They are from wide range of social and academic backgrounds. The programme is a 10 month course that starts in September and finishes in July. We can take up to 7 volunteers per annum through Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nThe programme is designed to develop and enhance the life skills of participants and prepare them for the world of work or further education though creating environment for opportunities to  impact the society as part of this vocational course. \r\n\r\nUnderpinning the development of the young people are accredited qualifications that ensure a rigor in the academic elements and ensures that participants leave with qualifications to add to their CV.  \r\n\r\nThese activities are facilitated through the Salt and Light North East family of churches and partnerships in the local community and associations. This allows us to develop working and training in the following areas:\r\n\r\nCommunity Development\r\nWorking with local links to deliver community outreach (Family fun, garden tidying, litter picking, special occasions), visiting and helping the elderly and vulnerable (Painting kitchens, bathrooms and gardening), mentoring and peer dialogue.\r\n\r\nSchools\r\nSchool assemblies, breakfast clubs, childrens work, classwork activities, international students, sex education, toddler groups, youth clubs and youth outreach.\r\n\r\nTraining\r\nMentoring, teaching, growing life skills (Financial management, time management, CV writing) and providing level 2 & 3 qualifications (Youth Practice and Principles; Skills, Employment, Training and Personal Development; and Religious Education). \r\n\r\nThe underpinning of our organisation is the support of many churches across the North East of England, which allows comprehensive pastoral support from many people with many years\u2019 experience.  \r\n\r\nWe also have in place comprehensive policies on diversity, children protection and vulnerable adults.  These allow us to accommodate and support any young person within our organisation.", null, "Taking Ground", "erasmus_2017-2-UK01-KA105-037061_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TS16"}
