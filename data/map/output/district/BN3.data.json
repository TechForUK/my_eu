It\u00b4s essentially adressed to prospective participants taking part in non-commercial trainings. Commercial trainees can also be considerd but in lower ranking. By involving their  vocational training colleges (BBIs) in the prozess of organisation and implementation of the project the mobinardo- foreign work placements are developed quantitatively but above all qualitatively. (eg, the precise description of the learning agreement is stipulated by experts versed in the subject, the placement is recognised as a component of the vocational course in the BBIs.\r\n\r\nMobinardo+ is based on the structure of the previous projects, mobinardo I \u2013 IV (2007-2014) certified since 2010. Within this framework approx. 600 participants of the target group \u201c initial vocational trainees\u201d have taken part in foreign work placements, usually of a duration of 4 \u2013 8 weeks. All mobinardo projects consist of the three areas, mobinardo flow, -individual and \u2013groups, but the emphasis in each case is different. \r\n\r\nIn mobinardo flow, the original form of scholarship allocation, the EU-Service Center (EU-GS)  arranges work placements in various countries, organises and supports the complete stay abroad. Experience has shown that this form of placement is especially suitable for inexperienced young candidates. In other cases taking only limited responsibility in the preparation for the trip, disposing of  limited support from the BBIs and sometimes bad matches for participants has all led to dissatisfaction. Mobinardo+ therefore offers small flows aimed at certain groups of candidates (eg. 3x5 nursery teachers). These flows relie on trusted partners abroad. This enables the special requirements of the individual candidates to be better met, for example, improved intercultural training and support, better recognition of the foreign placements in the development of the vocational courses as well as an increased formal recognition through the cooperation with BBI- teachers and -instructors. Small flows also provide the EU-GS with the possibility to gain initial experience in innovative contents and organisational forms. \r\n\r\nSince 2008, mobinardo individual has been offered in addition to mobinardo flow. This is aimed directly at individual candidates, who, independent of their BBIs, organise their own work experience abroad. Building on the growing interest of individual students and teachers in mobinardo, mobinardo+ wants to use the contact to individual applicants to win BBIs so that they become more active members of the mobinardo projects. This could be supported by assisting teachers in the intercultural and expert preparation of their students and relieving them of certain administrative tasks. Through this close cooperation with the vocational college staff, the EU-GS, as project promoter, can quickly utilise new developments in the courses and steer the project as required. During the further duration of Erasmus+ an extension of the project is planned for the vocational college teachers und instructors.\r\n\r\nThe third project area, mobinardo groups, is aimed at small groups in a certain course, who organise and carry out their work placement abroad together with the supporting teachers and the EU-GS. Since its introduction in 2010, mobinardo groups has seen a continual growth in demand so that this project area has developed into a strong transmission belt imparting practical knowledge and process related know-how to the BBIs. Mobinardo+ will continue to diversify in this area in order to better satisfy the needs of the interested groups and also to achieve the aims of the project more precisely. Mobinardo groups takes vocational courses into consideration, whereby long-term only a small percentage of the students can take part in the scheme.

By participating in this project, the college not only wants to make a contribution towards giving young people good career prospects and a positive perspective in life, but is also making a contribution to co-existence within Europe.\r\nAchieving intercultural and linguistic skills can be expected to open up a multitude of career prospects at a European and even international level.\r\nWith this project application, we intend to send two trainees for studying Management Assistant for Tourism, three Specialists in Media and Information Services and one Bookseller abroad.\r\n \r\nThe three tourism trainees all work at the same travel agency and will be spending their period of practical training at the partner agency in England . This will clearly improve their chances of finding work abroad in the future. Since many companies in this branch operate throughout Europe, or indeed internationally, work can be found in many countries. Participating in this project will help the students develop their language skills and improve their technical vocabulary. Experience gained during a training period abroad strengthens their self-confidence in their own abilities, thus broadening and developing their opportunities on the work market.\r\n \r\nThe three Specialists in Media and Information Services will be in three different countries during their practical training period. One student in her second year will spend her training at the British Library, where she will get to know an institution with an international reputation. A further student in his second year will be at a library near Copenhagen. As this library aims to extend an attractive selection to international guests, this will also contribute to intercultural competence. The third participant of this course is currently in her first year of study and will be going to the Austrian National Library. On the one hand, this project will focus on intercultural differences between two German-speaking countries and, on the other hand, concentrate on work in a national library, which cultivates international contacts due to its assignments.\r\nThe necessity for Specialists in Media and Information Services to have a command of specialist vocabulary is ever increasing due to the expansion of the use of electronic sources of information. Specifically in scientific and technical fields, these are often, and sometimes exclusively, in English.\r\n\r\nThe bookseller will spend her internship in a bookshop in Liverpool. She is in her first traing year and has a very good command of English which she hopes to improve regarding her technical vocabulary. All staff of the bookshop in Liverpool is responsible for all kind of decisions. Also the range of  booktitles is very different to the bookshop in Germany, it holds a lot of scientific and bilingual literature.\r\n \r\nFor all of the trainees, their stay abroad will be an opportunity, not only to learn to adapt to new social structures and ways of life, but also to get to know new work surroundings with their own specific demands.\r\nThe trainees will all take part in a preparatory seminar before they leave. This will take place in a youth hostel in the vicinity and will include an overnight stay. The seminar will focus on intercultural and linguistic preparation and will clarify technical formalities. It will be extremely helpful and interesting for the participants to meet others in a similar situation.\r\n \r\nA special blog has been set up so that all participants have the opportunity to collect and exchange information (http://european-trainee-mobilities.blogspot.com/).\r\nDuring the entire project the EU representative of the Berufskolleg Bachstra\u00dfe and the school\u2019s present coordinator will be in contact with the participants via Mail, telephone and, should it become necessary, in person.\r\n \r\nWhen everybody has returned there will be another meeting to which the trainers are also invited.

They only miss school for two weeks because the second two weeks of their period of practical training in England take place in the summer holidays.\r\nTo prepare the students for their stay in England they all receive lessons of vocational English. Many of them also take part in our school\u2019s business English courses that lead up to B2 exams of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI. EFB, Level 2).

Within this framework approx. 700 participants have completed practical placements abroad in various participating countries.\r\nThe main aim is that the participants are able to partake in the European job market. On the one hand, this goal is aspired to on an individual level through the attainment of necessary competencies, (e.g. foreign language knowledge, insight into company structures in other EU countries, understanding of the domestic market as a part of the European Economic Area etc.). On the other hand, the participants receive support in their personal development in that they have the opportunity to develop, for example, their self- confidence, intercultural competence, curiosity for things foreign, and their ability to change perspectives. Both aspects are reliant on and strengthen each other and contribute not only in a quantitative but also in a qualitative manner to the continuing development of the project according to the Erasmus+ Project aims. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the participation of vocational training personnel has not only triggered individual changes but also changes on an institutional level. Within the organisational and personnel structure of the participating vocational training institutions procedures must be developed to provide an official and meaningful project participation, in terms of content, for the vocational training personnel. For example, replacement arrangements, if required work, or rather, labour law requirements, agreements amongst colleagues, board resolutions, recognition of additional acquired competencies and expertise in advising students, building networks. The participation of vocational training personnel improves the quality of the practical implementation of the placements for the students, for example, through empathic and better informed support for the students during their placement abroad, and, if necessary, also through personal meetings and quality controls of the placement work place as well as improved communication with possible providers of placements for the students.\r\n\r\nMobinardo identifies four project areas:\r\n\r\n1. Mobinardo flow: is suitable for students who are not so confident and have little experience abroad. The journey to and from the placement is organised by the EU-GS. Additionally it arranges, with the help of the partner organisations in the participating countries, the placements and accommodation as well as preparing the students linguistically and culturally. It also sets the departure dates. During their stay abroad the students are looked after comprehensively by the local partners. Mobinardo flow can be used when there is sufficient demand. (Approx 20 individual enquiries)\r\n\r\n2. Mobinardo individual is suitable for participants who, with the support of the EU-GS, are able to organise their placements themselves (placements, accommodation, departure date, and journey), here the level of support can vary. The EU-GS ensures that the Erasmus+ Programme KA1 requirements are met at every stage of the individual planning, implantation and follow up phase of the work experience. Normally only applicants over 18 are eligible for this project area.\r\n\r\n3. Mobinardo groups is suitable for groups of vocational college students who require custom fit, highly specialised placements (for example, 8 weeks compulsory work experience). Vocational training staff at the vocational training institutes are partly responsible for the organisation and for the intercultural, linguistic and subject matter preparation. The allocation of tasks between the EU-GS and the vocational institutes varies according to requirements, depending on how much EU-GS support is necessary. This process does not only lead to high quality work experience, but also achieves, above and beyond this, a transfer of Know how to the institutes of vocational training in the field of Erasmus+KA1.

Therefore it is necessary the support of multiple profiles to give coherence to a competitive tourism offer in a relatively little known territory to the general public. It is important in the first place to offer future operators educational opportunities that reinforce more key skills: communication in foreign languages , digital competence, learning to learn, sense of initiative and entrepreneurship, cultural awareness. The experiences of transnational mobility will put them in contact with foreign business realities of their sector operating according to quality criteria, in which they will have the opportunity to acquire or upgrade skills in the multimedia field. Web technologies and social instruments are in fact necessary to the whole chain to communicate and promote new flows, to intercept, to organize accommodation, to manage tourism industry.

The fallout of the project outcomes within sending schools, besides strengthening existing network ties and the sharing of methodologies (in particular on the definition of the learning paths in non-formal contexts, on validation and recognition of the results) will contribute to raising their internationalization, fueling the interest and willingness to carry out projects with foreign countries (language studies, exchange experiences).

In the last few years there have been many changes in the Department of Education which support Natural Science teaching at the expense of foreign languages. However, we think that the current situation in the European Union requires more attention and high-quality education for this generation and those who will follow so that the idea of a united and tolerant multicultural society can become real. The unfavourable situation in the area of language education at primary schools supported our interest in participating in the project because we would be able to strengthen the position of foreign languages in education once again. We are convinced that an active citizen of the EU should be able to speak at least two foreign languages and it is extremely important to support their teaching, as well as the awareness of multilinguality and cultural differences in the EU from a very young age. Mutual tolerance and peaceful co-existence can only be achieved by means of language comprehension by representatives of different cultures.Main aims of the project:- to cooperate with foreign partners and thus participate in high-quality education focused on foreign language teaching in the context of European cultures- to become acquainted with innovative methods in foreign language teaching used abroad and to implement them afterwards in our teaching system- participating in educational mobilities to support the main idea of the project: Teaching a foreign language as a base of a working European society- to improve the level of key competences of our teachers and thus to improve the quality of foreign language teaching at our school- to create new relationships with other participants of educational activities and in the future cooperate with foreign partners in an active way- to raise the standard of education of our school nationally and internationally There are 5 pedagogical employees and 1 administration employee that will take part in the project. They  all have been chosen according to their previous activities at our school. Most of them teach a foreign language, but some of them also teach Slovak and History. They are involved in the education of pupils at our school and outside the school with some of them teaching Slovak as a foreign language to foreigners living in our city.  They prepare pupils for different competitions, take part in language activities organized by different educational institutions and participate with pupils in different projects to support the language skills of pupils as well as projects thematically oriented on the life of Eurocitizens in the EU in the past and present.The project is divided into several stages. We consider the educational mobilities of employees in the EU countries the most important part. The mobilities will be aimed at foreign language teaching concerning culture, society and new teaching trends. After completing the mobilities, we are planning to create a manual in the form of a document which will contain knowledge and experience gained during the mobilities. We will try to implement that into our foreign language teaching not only by means of the participants, but also other pedagogical employees to whom the manual will be introduced. We are planning to process and introduce innovative methods, new techniques and didactical aids gained in the project into our school system; to lead debate clubs and discussions and workshops about current issues in the EU; to present the process and results of the project and share the experience gained in the project outside our institution.By putting the project into action, we expect that we can improve the competencies of our teachers \u2013 not only the language competencies, but also pedagogical, social and cultural, thus improving the educational process. They will enhance their knowledge about the culture and society of the country they will stay in, broaden their horizons about current life and share opinions on current situations and events in the EU with other foreign teachers and colleagues. Thanks to this, we can implement new methods and procedures into foreign language teaching at our school, strengthen European awareness of our employees and share it amongst our pupils. After a successful completion of the project we would like to cooperate with foreign colleagues and partners in the future, not only in the area of further teachers\u00b4 education, but also participating in international projects with our pupils. We expect that the position and  the credit of our school will be reinforced at the local and regional levels, and also nationally and internationally.

To reinforce the European concept in the M\u00fcnster region, three vocational colleges have joined together to take advantage of synergies and to intensify cooperation on a regional level. This consortium is supported by the EU office in regional government and has built on collective experiences gained through the EU programme, Leonardo mobility, which has been running successfully since 2010.Aims:Within the project framework apprentices and full time students from the region, who have comparably few opportunities to gain experience in foreign work places, are given the chance to gain work experience at a foreign work place and to improve intercultural as well as foreign language skills. The cooperation also offers educational establishments the chance to build a network with the aim of establishing support for the individual and in the preparation of work places.Number and profile of participants:Approx. 80 students attending business courses full and part time. Description of the activities:The participants receive the chance to take part in a work experience at a foreign work place. They are supported by selected foreign partner organisations in the choice of their work placement companies as well as in their accommodation and any language and intercultural preparations in the country of their work experience. These receiving organisations ensure the on-site support whilst the support of the sending organisations is ensured through the use of new communication and information technology (e.g. email, mobile phone).Due to the positive experience made with the individual training companies and due to the personal commitment of the participants in the companies offering training, the participants are offered a funded foreign work experience. The sending organisation, or someone within the organisation, takes responsibility for the language and intercultural preparation. The organisation sending students abroad ensures the quality as well as continuous support of the students during the placements. Project implementation:The vocational colleges and the partner organisations taking part in the consortium are responsible for the selection of suitable candidates. Together with the participants they decide on the goals for a placement abroad. They help the candidates complete the necessary documents and prepare the journey. They guarantee support during the placement and evaluate the success of each placement abroad together with the individual candidates.Description of the expected results and consequences as well as long term benefits:The results of the project reflect the goals mentioned above as closely as possible. Experiences during the project are used to help improve planning and implementing of the next project.The students aim for long-term results affecting both their personal development and their chances in the job market. The project is also meant to promote the European competence and responsibility of the participating companies and, furthermore, support future employers. In general this project is supposed to  promote European concepts and ideas in the M\u00fcnster region.Additionally the schools within the consortium improve their project based skills.

It is a project intended to be serving the interests of the whole school and has been developed further continuously.  Enlarging the project was one of the goals we were able to achieve with the new Erasmus+ program. 122 students of our school were able to participate in our AVE Erasmus-program between 2014 and 2015. The project was a huge success which is the reason why we would like to start the follow-up project AVE Erasmus 2 this year.Particularly interested and suited students and apprentices of the PSB are enabled to get to know the world of work in another European country. Furthermore, they are able to increase their theoretical knowledge and their jobwise skills as well as their command of different languages and get a non-touristic impression of the respective country. Within the last years, the experiences the PSB has shown that the participants have better chances to get a job and above that to develop their personality. Besides its economic focus the PSB also promotes students with a technical, commercial, health and socio-pedagogical orientation. The program is intended to be open for all students attending an eligible course of education. About 70 students can participate in the different offers of internship. The new Ave-Erasmus- program can be regarded as an innovation of the previous project. Besides being a German acronym, Ave is also Latin for \"be greeted\". In Spain the word is also used to refer to a big bird and a high speed train. Values like flexibility and mobility are therefore covered by the selected acronym. The AVE program contains three different modules: Ave-flow, Ave-individual and Ave-Canarias. In all three cases the PSB is the applying and responsible organisation.  There are four different partners in the Ave-flow module which host the students. These partners are located in Spain (Seville), England (Brighton), Ireland (Dublin) and Italy (Sizilien/Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto). The duration of the internship is four weeks from September till October, including the autumn break. The PSB and its partners organise the flight, transfer, internship, accommodation, language course and a cultural program for the students. The internships are selected to fit the students' course of study. This module is equal to the one that has been carried out over the past few years. The Italian organisation has been our partner since 2014. All other organisations have been well-known and trusted partners for several years. Within the Ave-individual module the students organise everything themselves. The PSB just checks the application and the suitability of the company and supports the students whenever necessary. The departure can, in this case, take place throughout the whole year and its duration can vary depending on the students' needs. However, both aspects have to be discussed and specified in detail. This module was especially created to serve the special interests of students whose training company has either a branch or close business partner in a European country.Last but not least, the Ave-Canarias module cooperates with a partner on the Canary Islands and offers internships in upscale hotels. The PSB is well acquainted with the partner organization on Tenerife by now. The jobs assigned are again depending on the students' course of education. The hotels can employ various professions from carpenters to hair dressers and office clerks. The duration of this internship is five weeks and includes three and a half weeks of the summer break.

They will have already obtained knowledge concerning such matters of commercial correspondence as enquiry, offer, order, delay in payment and notice of defects. Further, they will have learned how to handle different types of forms in the field of foreign trade and will have acquired detailed knowledge in the subjects of business administration, national economy and infonomics. In the latter they will have learned how to use computer programmes like Excel, Word and Powerpoint and will be well trained in word processing.Due to all these skills acquired, they are qualified for working in international importing and exporting enterprises, shipping companies, international industrial concerns and organisations as well as in hotels and/or language schools.At a time when their state of knowledge enables the trainees to deal with responsible tasks in a company or an institution, the internships offer the opportunity to link their theoretical knowledge with practical training. What concerns us primarily is that for teaching purposes didactically reduced case studies become verified in a real environment in order to enhance the students\u2019 chances on the European labour market.As this is a full-time vocational school training, the trainees have got few opportunities to work in side jobs to earn their own living. Thus, doing an internship in a foreign country does not only mean financial losses during the time of their stay but also considerable problems in raising the funds for a period abroad.

For already three years now, we have been applying the ECVET instruments in co-operation with these partners. In recurrently held workshops we regularly update and adjust the instruments to the corresponding needs.All details described above are mainly applicable to the Foreign Language Correspondence Clerks/A-levels, except the fact that these students are at the initial stage of their vocational training at the time of their internship. The trainees of the dual educational courses benefit from their three-week internship by testing their practical knowledge in other European countries. The teachers draw upon this experience by improving the quality of their training and to provide the entire staff with the newly gained knowledge and competences. The participants of the project will benefit considerably and sustainably, both, in their professional and private life from the improvement of their language skills, newly gained cultural insights and, last but not least, their personality development. 1 The students of the triennial course do a combined degree course of AVCE and State-certified Commercial Assistant for Foreign Languages.2 Dual courses are a combination of theoretical vocational training at school and practical training in a company.", "http://www.elc-brighton.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-002949_8"], ["2DJ", "spread your wings - Poolprojekt f\u00fcr Azubis", "STAGES LIMITED", 312159.0, "The company LearnBiz.com GmbH organizes a poolproject for apprentices in the German Dual System.

As we are regularly conducting seminars in preparation of study tours to Turkey for our students, we are well prepared for these activities and have qualified members of staff.Concerning the organizational development, we are at present involving our advisory office for students conducting practical terms. Up to now, the responsibility for students in foreign countries was with the European office, in future, the advisory office for practical terms will be responsible for the European students as well. This is part of our internationalisation strategie, to launch european aspects into regular work.With the introduction of a new curriculum there will be a stronger focus on European subjects. We plan to introduce a new seminar for students as follow-up to their European practical term.Educators as well as heads of institutions of early childcare are already active in the supervision of foreign students doing practical work there. As part of our strategy of internationalisation we will involve these colleagues in the exchange of staff with foreign professionals.While the homepage of the PFH is being revised at present, we will improve the presentation of European work with the help of a former colleague of the European team. We will install a platform to improve continuous informal communication with our European partners. We have already installed texts concerning European educational systems on the platform of our partner organization in Lyon. Further development concerning the evaluation of feedbacks from our students will be differentiated beyond the existing in the course of the present application period. We will introduce a more systematical evaluation and develop new forms for the students. As a greater number of colleagues is involved with European matters than ever before, there will be a regular date for meetings during the forthcoming school-year to improve exchange between members of staff.To enhance public relations we had a conference in 2007, on the occasion of 10 years European work at the PFH. 2017 would be a suitable date to have a conference on 20 years of European work here, so preliminary considerations are made.In general, we are consolidating the international aspects of our work, we are improving organizational aspects at our institution, and we are expanding the number and quality of staff playing a role in these activities.

To reinforce the European concept in the M\u00fcnster region, three vocational colleges have joined together to take advantage of synergies and to intensify cooperation on a regional level. This consortium is supported by the EU office of the Bezriksregierung M\u00fcnster and has built on collective experience gained through the EU programme, Leonardo mobility, which has been running successfully since 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nAims:\r\n\r\nWithin the project framework apprentices and full time students from the region, who have comparably few opportunities to gain experience in foreign work places, are given the chance to gain work experience at a foreign work place and to improve intercultural as well as foreign language skills. The cooperation also offers educational establishments the chance to build a network with the aim of establishing support for the individual and in the preparation of work places.\r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants:\r\n\r\nApprox. 100 students attending business courses full and part time. \r\n\r\nDescription of the activities:\r\n\r\nThe participants receive the chance to take part in a work experience at a foreign work place. They are supported by selected foreign partner organisations in the choice of their work placement companies as well as in their accommodation and any language and intercultural preparations in the country of their work experience. These receiving organisations ensure the on-site support whilst the support of the sending organisations is ensured through the use of new communication and information technology (e.g. email, mobile phone).\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the positive experience made with the individual training companies and due to the personal commitment of the participants in the companies offering training, the participants are offered a funded foreign work experience. The sending organisation, or someone within the organisation, takes responsibility for the language and intercultural preparation. The organisation sending students abroad ensures the quality as well as continuous support of the students during the placements. \r\n\r\n\r\nProject implementation:\r\n\r\nThe vocational colleges and the partner organisations taking part in the consortium are responsible for the selection of suitable candidates. Together with the participants they decide on the goals for a placement abroad. They help the candidates complete the necessary documents and prepare the journey. They guarantee support during the placement and evaluate the success of each placement abroad together with the individual candidates.\r\n\r\nDescription of the expected results and consequences as well as long term benefits:\r\n\r\nThe results of the project reflect the goals mentioned above as closely as possible. The experience made during the project are used to help planning and implementing the next project.\r\n\r\nThe students aim for long-term results affecting both their personal development and their chances in the job market. The project is also meant to promote the European competence and responsibility of the participating companies and, furthermore, support future employers. In general this project is supposed to  promote European concepts and ideas in the M\u00fcnster region.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the schools within the consortium improve their project based skills.
