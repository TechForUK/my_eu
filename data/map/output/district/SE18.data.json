Finland, Finland; JM / LOUD, Norway; Pink Noise, Austria: Popkollo, Sweden and Stowarzyszenie Kobieca Transsmisja, Poland. \r\n\r\nAll these organisations are active in youth empowerment through music and come from the tradition of girls rock camps; they are all committed to empowering girls, women, trans, and gender non-conforming people using the tools of music and arts education to foster community and build power. \r\n\r\nMEME came out of a need for both young people and youth workers to exchange and connect with each other around youth empowerment through music and creativity and to develop their music, social and media competencies and critical thinking.\r\n\r\nApprox. 110 people will take part in MEME \r\n\r\n60 young people from 16 to 30 will take part in the MEME Youth Exchange. Many have fewer opportunities and face issues including: language barriers, being early school leavers or having lower qualifications, coming from problem urban areas and lower income families; dealing with mental health issues and conditions such as aspergers or ADHD, being refugees or young migrants / people of colour, living with disabilities and chronic illnesses.\r\n\r\nApprox. 50 youth workers will take part in both main activities and they come from diverse and differently structured organisations across Europe that all work with empowerment through music.\r\n\r\nMEME acknowledges that girls and women, transgender people and gender non-conforming people face hurdles in society. To address this imbalance and to achieve our goals, both activities are for the following people: both cisgender and transgender girls and women; trans and gender non-conforming youth and adults including trans boys and men, intersex youth and adults, people who generally have fewer opportunities and role models within music scenes and society in general.\r\n\r\nMEME consists of three activities: an Advance Planning Visit, the MEME Youth Exchange and the MEME Seminar & Network Exchange.\r\n\r\nThe AVP in Berlin will enable one representative from each organisation and accompanying young people to visit the site and plan the Youth Exchange. \r\n\r\nThe MEME Youth Exchange will take place at the fully accessible Berlin state music academy in FEZ, Berlin from July 23rd to 29th 2018. It will consist of three tracks: \r\n\r\n1. Music making and band formation\r\nYoung people will receive instruction in instrument playing and band formation according to the \u201cgirls rock camp\u201d methods. They will write songs together and, if desired, play a concert on Saturday in the concert hall.\r\n\r\n2. Documentation and media making\r\nA film, documentation and media centre will be created, where young people will learn-by-doing about storytelling through film, social media, etc. \r\n\r\n3. Non-hierarchical and collective organising and leadership\r\nYoung people will learn about collective organisation in anti-discrimination context and put this into practice throughout the Exchange.\r\n\r\nLanguage mediators will be on hand for youth who need them and youth and social workers will support youth and each other throughout the Exchange. \r\n\r\nThe MEME Seminar & Network Exchange will take place in Belgrade, Serbia from September 20th to 23rd - the leadership track will focus on direct youth work and empowerment through music and media making and the organising track will encourage reflection on organisation and movement building. Both tracks will reflect on the MEME Youth Exchange.\r\n\r\nWe will use the \u201cDo It Together\u201d methodology as practiced by girls rock camps. Our methods focuses on guiding each other to see the possibilities that lie within the situation, the instrument, the equipment and the group. Leaders are there to guide if people get stuck in a process and to guide through group finding. \r\n\r\nYoung people participating will develop skills in group creative processes and be better able to advocate for themselves and for others. They will gain concrete skills in music making, media making and organising. Youth workers will gain knowledge about gender diversity, anti-oppression and social inclusion in youth work and learn new methods in youth empowerment through music. Partner organisations will be strengthened by being better placed to engage youth with fewer opportunities and foster ownership amongst young people. \r\n\r\nLong term, MEME will have connected organisations in meaningful and practical ways and these connections will continue long after the project has ended. All participants will have experienced how making music, media-making and organising can help bring people together and learn from each other.

This is important both for the emotional, social and educational\r\ndevelopment of the pupil and for the overall governance of the institution. As a condition of successful learning, teachers need to strengthen their role as facilitators of learning.

Any discrimination national or religious is excluded. This program can offer the occasion of a better acquaintance between countries, their residents, as well as, the way of promotion of intercultural education against the racism and xenophobia.\r\nIntercultural dialogue is the basis for real and lasting understanding and respect, which can only be built up through the acquisition of knowledge about other cultures. In this way intercultural dialogue can combat ignorance, prejudice, racism and xenophobia.\r\nThe main concepts of the project is the sensitization to the idea of \u201cother people\u201d and reflection on one's own intercultural identity.

A new learning environment which is attractive to teachers, students and the whole school will gradually be created, favoring innovation and creativity in the field of teaching. At the meetings we will work together, become more aware of our own national identity and at the same time we will learn about and appreciate other cultures. \r\n At a more global level, this project will offer a new perspective of culture and values. Our project represents a necessary approach to address the question, how cultural diversity and values can contribute to dialogue  in Europe. How European citizens of different religious, cultural and political backgrounds can live together and enter into dialogue of mutual respect and understanding. The project examines their belonging to Europe while discussing their outward cultural identity, thus opening the debate to include issue of migration, racism, integration, mutual understanding, tolerance and acceptance of everyone in Europe.  We are currently witnessing a new generation of young people who are redefining their cultural identity in a changing Europe. Many children of migrants were born in/out Europe, went to school in Europe and would like to work and create a family in Europe.\r\nNine European meetings will take place during the development of the project and will allow the European dimension of activities to be reinforced. Teachers and students will be able to benefit from these exchanges and meetings, thus creating a true opportunity for intercultural exchanges and dialogue. The project aims to raise awareness amongst EUROPEAN citizens and particularly among young people on the importance of using intercultural dialogue as a tool for promoting an active European citizenship. The target group includes students and teachers. The foreseen activities are discussion, survey, case study,workshops, promotion of ICH/TCH,seminar, digital newspaper, international folk dance and song team.\r\nThe objectives are:\r\nTo raise awareness of the importance of intercultural dialogue, especially among young people, which aims to contribute to foster an active European citizenship \u2013 cosmopolitan and with respect for cultural diversity.\r\nTo enhance interest and respect for the originality and variety of other cultural, national and religious groups.\r\nTo confront younger generations with differences in culture, opinions and behavior and to look for ways to cope with these issues in an open manner without judging each other.\r\nThe motto: Nice to meet you!\r\nSubjects: Migration,Early Leaving School,  Racism, Stereotypes, Tolerance, Acceptance of differences.\r\nThe project method is an educational enterprise in which children solve a practical problem.
