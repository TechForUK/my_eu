Staff will also visit the Specialist Language Centre in Rouen. As a result of this our staff will have accessed high quality French teaching to use back at Plantation. The confidence of staff throughout Plantation will therefore improve. \r\nThose teachers who visit France, teach in their schools and attend the language learning in the Specialist Language Centre (Rouen) will disseminate what they have learned to up-skill all teachers through staff meetings, training and workshops sharing teaching resources, ideologies and styles.\r\nThrough teaching and learning in our French partner school,  staff at Plantation will develop their awareness of different teaching styles and pedagogies. Our Headteacher will be taking part in at least one visit to France and he will be able to observe and learn about different assessment procedures and school policies. Everything gained will be passed onto all staff at Plantation to ensure maximum impact.\r\nStaff who personally visit France will get the opportunity to experience different cultures and traditions and these will be disseminated to all staff. These traditions and cultures will be taught to all children through high-quality foreign language lessons from highly confident staff at Plantation.\r\nIn the wake of Brexit, at Plantation we want to maintain and encourage positive links with the rest of Europe and countries further afield. This will help children at Plantation become well rounded individuals who have respect for all cultures and traditions. The project will help children at Plantation see that there is a world outside of Knowsley, outside of Liverpool and outside of the UK. It will also help develop their knowledge and understanding of global issues and how this impacts their lives.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Plantation's International Language Development Scheme will not be possible without gaining Erasmus+ funding. Gaining the funding will have a hugely positive impact on Plantation and will shape the future our children.", "http://www.plantationprimary.com", "Plantation Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035725_coordinator"], ["0TH", "Plantation's European Development Project", "Plantation Primary School", 40244.0, "At Plantation we place high importance on teaching our pupils about the world around them. As a staff we work together to ensure all children have the opportunity to learn about other countries, cultures and traditions worldwide through our International School work. For this school year 2017-2018 we have planned 12 international and global whole school activities to promote this learning. We think globally and have had staff training in Global linking and use this to teach our children about global initiatives that we need to take responsibility for and how we are all part of a global community. In the wake of Brexit, we want to maintain and encourage positive links with the rest of Europe and countries further afield. This will help children at Plantation become well rounded individuals who have respect for all cultures and traditions. The project will help children at Plantation see that there is a world outside of Knowsley, outside of Liverpool and outside of the UK. It will also help develop their knowledge and understanding of global issues and how this impacts their lives. \r\nOur main objectives for visiting Sweden are to explore and learn more about their outdoor provision and how this impacts on children with SEN and social, emotional needs. In Scandinavian societies the concept of friluftsliv, benefiting from outdoor life, shows the importance of environmental education and allowing children to spend time outside the classroom. It allows them to become more connected to the outside world around them, builds resilience, self-confidence and promotes a positive attitude for learning. At Plantation we have a number of children who would greatly benefit from a wider range of outdoor provision as from analysing data we have identified certain barriers which are affecting the achievement of pupils. Our objective for attending the outdoor learning course in Sweden is to develop our understanding of outdoor provision possibilities to set up here at Plantation. We want to develop our outdoor spaces to support vulnerable children further and help them progress and develop in a positive way. We have a large number of looked after, Free School Meals, Pupil Premium and children with a SEN who would greatly benefit from this. A number of these children have behaviournal needs, are disengaged with mainstream school life or have low attainment and attendance records. Currently we use a service called Motiv8 which provides an alternative educational provision for children who are struggling to cope within mainstream education, however a number of their activities are based around outdoor learning. Our aim is to be able to provide similar outdoor provision at Plantation so these children have access to this style of learning without having to leave our site, as this can also be disruptive to their daily routine. To do this successfully, as a school and staff, we need to see examples of successful outdoor provision which is known to raise standards and promote progress. We believe by visiting Sweden and observing this practice and the teaching styles associated with it, we can develop and improve our own outdoor practice back in school to further support our vulnerable groups of children to the best of our ability. At Plantation we have a fantastic outdoor space including gardens, a large field and a nature reserve. These areas are perfectly suited to accommodate outdoor learning but are not currently being used to their full potential. Therefore another objective of visiting Sweden would be to observe how they adapt their outdoor spaces to function successfully to provide outdoor learning opportunities. We will learn how to set up, maintain and use our outdoor spaces efficiently from observing good practice in Swedish primary schools.\r\nAnother objective is to develop our leadership program in school. By sending senior and middle leaders to attend the Leadership in Education course in Sweden we can develop our own leadership strategies. It will allow the development and understanding of how other countries deal with the planning and delivery of the curriculum which we can then compare to our own practice. This will enable us to develop and improve our current strategies for the benefit of staff regarding planning and our children, ensuring they have a broad and balanced curriculum.", "http://www.plantationprimary.com", "Plantation Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-046862_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "L26"}
