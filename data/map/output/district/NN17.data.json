The District of the Future (DoF) project is a project funded by the European Union (EU) with the objective to increase energy efficiency in a city district using innovative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) approaches. It will help city leaders to achieve quantifiable and significant reduction up to 30 to 40% of energy consumption and CO2 emissions and will improve citizen awareness and people involvement.The project will be executed by a consortium formed by a world leader in integrated telecommunications, technological consultancy firms, ICT software and equipment providers, SMEs, a Research and Development organization, energy companies and the public authorities of the cities of Sabadell (Spain), Orl\u00e9ans (France) and Corby (UK) that will provide the real life environment for the project.DoF will use ICT to collect, register and monitor energy data and bring this to a cloud-based software platform. This platform will analyze energy patterns in each city district. That will allow predicting energy consumption and energy production behavior in each district. DoF will provide a system based upon standardized state-of-the-art communications, that will support city authorities and citizens in taking the right decisions in order to optimize energy systems and improve energy efficiency in the involved city districts.The project will contribute to the adoption of green ICT technologies by city authorities. Just by reapplying the DoF approach in other European city districts the project will make a sustainable contribution to the objectives of EC 2020 Energy and Climate Change, 20% of energy from renewable, 20% increase of energy efficiency, 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990.", 245411.0, 4797804.0, "DoF", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_111353_952416714"], ["5EU", "Combined HEat SyStem by using Solar Energy and heaT pUmPs", "Electric Corby Community Interest Company", "The project objective is to design, implement and promote a reliable, efficient and profitable system able to supply heating and hot water in buildings mainly from renewable sources. The proposed system is based in the optimal combination of solar thermal (ST) energy production, seasonal heat storage and high efficient heat pump use. Heat pumps will be improved technically in order to obtain the best performace in the special conditions of the CHESS-SETUP system.\n\nThe used solar panels will be hybrid photovoltaic and solar thermal (PV-ST) panels, which is a promising solution for also producing the electricity consumed by the heat and water pumps of the heating system and part of the electricity consumed in the building. Hybrid solar panels are a key element to achieving energy self-sufficiency in buildings, especially in dense urban areas where the roof availability is one of the most limiting factors.\n\nAlso will be considered the integration of other energy sources as biomass or heat waste, to make the system suitable for any climate conditions. The project will also explore the possibility to integrate the system with other electricity or cooling technologies (solar cooling, cogeneration).\n\nThe system operation will be optimized according to some external factors, as electricity price or user requirements by using a smart control and management systems developed specifically for the project.\n\nThis proposal will be materialized in three pilot experiences: a small-scale prototype in Lavola's headquarters (Spain), 50 new dwellings located in Corby (England) and a new sport centre located in Sant Cugat (Spain).", 863808.0, 3212273.0, "CHESS-SETUP", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_203231_952416714"]]}, "erasmus": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "project", "organisationName", "maxContribution", "summary", "organisationWebsite", "coordinatorName", "myEuId"], "data": [["1AJ", "A good start for all: Sustaining TrAnsitions across the Early Years", "Rockingham Primary School", 283427.0, "The project START is an Erasmus+ Strategic Partnership in the field of School Education running for 30 months, from September 2016 to February 2018.
