This tool will be developed by a consortium led by the University of Glasgow (UK) and supported by Space Systems Finland (Finland), LIDAX (Spain) and Magna Parva (UK). \nThe University of Glasgow will provide expertise in the field of ultrasonic drilling, which is used to penetrate rock without generating large reaction forces and thus enables deployment of the UPCD from a small lander. Space Systems Finland will provide software that will enable autonomous operations of the device, which will be essential for sample preservation, LIDAX will produce a deployment system to permit highly repeatable operations, and Magna Parva will carry out the vital systems engineering functions.\nThe focus of the UPCD project will be a field trial in an analogue site, namely the active permafrost of Alexander Island, Antarctic. This volatile-bearing rock is exceptionally Mars-like and it is a key objective of the UPCD project to extract and containerise samples with the volatiles still intact. Ultrasonic drilling with its high downhole efficiency and supported autonomous sample health monitoring, offers drilling without elevating the sample temperature, thus reducing drive-off of the compounds that could tell us so much about the history of water on other planets.\nThese experiments will only be possible, and the results only meaningfully analysed, if we are confident that the drill site is representative of volatile-bearing rocks and that the containerised samples contain the volatiles we seek. The engineering team at the trials will be accompanied by a scientist specialising in the history of water in the solar system, to ensure selection of appropriate drill sites and to evaluate the quality of the samples we extract.", 305590.0, 2413339.0, "UPCD", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_188831_971798478"], ["4JS", "Development of a new functional antimicrobial edible film for fresh meat products", "Pepceuticals Limited", "The main scope of the MEATCOAT is the development of a new functional antimicrobial edible coating for meat packaging to improve the integrity of products during distribution and commercialisation. The proposed system will increase shelf-life of the product due to their antimicrobial characteristics. The present proposal aims help end-user communities of SMEs: the fresh food industry (and particularly fresh meat sub-sector) by developing a new concept of edible coating that will enable a better preservation and quality of meat products and a longer shelf life in the market. The second community is the coating manufacturers, who need new products to launch to the market, to remain competitive and support their growth.These communities represents mature sectors in Europe with annual revenues valued in \u20ac40,456M and require continues effort in research and development to get products in a very competitive market to attend the consumer demand with increasing level of quality. A huge amount of fresh meat is disposed everyday from market selves. Better ways of preservation would avoid this and produce huge saves in the full supply chain. In addition, there is pressure to develop new products based on renewable sources that can replace present oil-based plastics whose recycling activity is inefficient and expensive. EC legislation is trying to curb the landfill disposal of recyclable or non-recyclable plastics, by encouraging the development of new products replacing recyclable or non-recyclable plastic packaging. As a result there are high levels of innovation in green packaging(lightweight and bio-based packaging materials). On the other hand, all new developments and innovations in the packaging industry will have to meet the current European standards and regulations for food contact materials, safety and public health (EC1935/2004, EC2073/2005 and EC450/2009), as well as the requirements of the REACH legislation.", 189732.0, 1698912.0, "Meatcoat", null, null, null, "http://www.meatcoat.eu/", "http://www.pepceuticals.co.uk", null, "fp7_101101_962708414"], ["2FZ", "Aligned Natural Fibres and Textiles for Use in Structural Composite Applications", "Formax (Uk) Ltd", "Biocomposites manufactured from natural materials such as fibres and bioderived polymers offer a sustainable alternative to traditional ones, but at present they are not available for use in structural applications.

However, this technology is not yet available for use in structural applications.\n\nTo address this, the EU-funded 'Aligned natural fibres and textiles for use in structural composite applications' (NATEX) project focused on the development of composite structural materials that consisted of thermoplastic or thermoset resins and natural fibres. It was envisaged that the new products would compete in applications where materials from non-renewable resources like steel, aluminium and reinforced plastics are used today.\n\nThe key objective of the NATEX consortium was to develop and optimise techniques for modifying the fibre surface, and for spinning and weaving the fibres in order to improve their impregnation in the matrix polymer. Additionally, a range of resin-processing methods and joining technologies were tested and adapted to improve the compatibility of the polymers with natural fibres.\n\nInnovative two- and three-dimensional fabrics from blends of thermoplastic and natural fibres have also been successfully prepared and characterised.
