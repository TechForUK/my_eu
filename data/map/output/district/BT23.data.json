We recognise that our pupils require a new skill set as they enter an ever-evolving, ever-demanding global job market; but more than that, they need the transversal skills that will enable them to act as entrepreneurs, who will provide the innovative spark to create new jobs & bring new wealth to their communities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, we recognise the need to 'upskill' our teachers in the delivery of  a more open-ended, activity-based, experiential approach to learning, to enable our children to develop these skills. Consequently, our project will include collaboration between our schools to enable our teachers to learn from each other, both virtually, via eTwinning/Skype etc., and face-to-face, at transnational Learning, Teaching & Training events.\r\n\r\nIn addition, our staff will collaborate, within & between our schools, to develop a new, skills-based scheme of work for Entrepreneurship Education, with clear learning outcomes for our pupils. We want to embed Entrepreneurship Education  into our school curricula from the early years, so that entrepreneurship will become part of the unique ethos of our schools.\r\n\r\nThrough collaboration in a series of open-ended, entrepreneurial challenges, our pupils will develop the entrepreneurial attitudes of self-confidence, determination, resilience, & self-awareness, alongside the entrepreneurial skills which enable them to think in new & imaginative ways, to generate, implement, test and review innovative solutions to a variety of problems or business opportunities. Our senior pupils will have opportunity to enter competitions, to form mini-companies & engage in meaningful collaborations in real situations, undertaking real roles & producing real products and services.\r\n\r\nThe apex of our pupil collaboration will take place during short term pupil exchanges, where they will form international teams to create products for sale or demonstration at an International Trade Fair in the host school or community.\r\n\r\nThe immediate impacts of our project will be evidenced in the professional development of our staff & their increased motivation & confidence; the embedding of an entrepreneurial ethos & Entrepreneurship Education in our schools and; in pupils, who are problem-solvers, confident, innovative, adaptable & creative, who engage with, and value, their learning, & who are more employable & ready to take responsibility for their own futures & that of their local communities.\r\n\r\nWe will become beacon schools for Entrepreneurship Education, & will ensure that the results of our partnership will be made available beyond our partnership, in local schools & the wider international learning community, through a series of teacher meets, workshops, job shadowing opportunities and publishing our results on eTwinning, Erasmus +, Open Discovery Space, Euro and our website(s) etc.\r\n\r\nWe will also challenge our Educational Authorities to make Entrepreneurship Education a statutory component of our primary school curricula & to provide schools with curriculum materials, schemes and resources & a national scheme for accreditation similar to other awards e.g., International School Award, Fair Trade School etc.\r\n\r\n(2) Our secondary objective concerns the migrant crisis sweeping Europe, creating increased tensions in communities and stresses within our schools.\r\n\r\nWe see the destructive potential of migration without social integration & inclusion.

We want to develop a nursery with children's play at its heart. A vibrant nursery, bubbling over with daily adventures, imagination, creativity, curiosity, ingenuity, exploration, challenge and fun. A secure home, away from home, where children 'Play to Learn'. \r\n\r\nWe believe that children learn best through open-ended play, and place great value on their acquisition of the so called, 'soft skills' of collaboration, concentrating, resilience, using one's own initiative, questioning, testing, risk taking, taking responsibility for one's own actions, empathy etc. These 'soft skills' are the foundations, upon which, all future learning will be built.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a new provider, we are aware of our relative inexperience and the need to develop our professional skills and competences as early years practitioners. We need to learn when and how to intervene and interact with the children to enrich their learning experiences.  We also need to develop and enhance our skills and competences in the organisation, management and day-to-day running of our nursery unit.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we have applied for an Erasmus+ KA1 grant to enable us to achieve our objectives for our pupils' learning, for our staff's professional development and the effective operation of our nursery unit. Our partners in Greece and Estonia are applying simultaneously for a similar KA1 grant. \r\n\r\nWe propose to send six members of staff, chosen from our Senior Management and Early Years' Teams to International Conferences in Iceland and Spain, around the theme of Play-based Learning. It is hoped that the training and knowledge our staff receive will inspire and empower them to take forward this innovative play-based approach to the curriculum.\r\n\r\nThey will further investigate a play-based, experiential approach to learning, by travelling to pre-schools in Greece and Estonia, to observe best practice; to shadow colleagues; to team teach with them; to learn together in workshops around pre-agreed themes; and to enter into a professional dialogue with their staff. \r\n\r\nWe believe that, our participation in this international learning community will help us develop as early years practitioners and will provide a creative force in our pre-school, transforming and enriching our children's learning experiences, empowering them, developing their self-esteem and promoting positive attitudes as they \u2018Play to Learn\u2019. \r\n\r\nIn addition, we believe that our more experienced partners from Greece and Estonia, will benefit from reciprocal visits to Northern Ireland, and that together we will enhance the International profile of our schools.

One of the receiving partners in Spain, FFUSL, will offer direct traineeships in digital marketing for tourism; another, Trainee+Up will source traineeships in the local zoo or animal shelters; and the final Spanish receiving partner, FEGREPPA, will offer training and traineeships at local bakeries and patisseries.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are based on the learners' needs and the College's strategic plans for European development and internationalisation which complement the partners' aims and purposes:\r\n1. Develop and consolidate an increased number of strong and effective European partnerships with relevant organisations in order to develop learning and teaching practices. This will build the capacity of SERC's internationisation policy and underpin the development of a European/International curricula in time\r\n2.

Widen staff participation in European mobility opportunities for professional development purposes - upskilling staff in technical areas, and education and industry developments to expand their teaching capabilities; gaining knowledge from learning and teaching pedagogies; and developing personal competences associated with collaborative projects such as organisational and communication skills. This is a key focus of SERC's Staff Development Policy.\r\n\r\nThe key results expected for the learners include a meaningful industry experience with increased technical knowledge and professional skills in their chosen sector - working with professionals applying and improving upon what they have learned on their course and learning new techniques and methods. For Construction this will be practical application of learned methodologies and project work, IT learners will develop skills in using IT for communications, Sports learners will develop skills in coaching children, for Performing Arts this will be in backstage skills, for Early Years it will be in carrying out activities and reflecting on their own practice, and specific practice in Reggio Emilia and Montesorri, Travel and Tourism will learn digital marketing skills for the industry, Animal Management will develop skills in exotic animal care, and Catering learn traditional baking techniques. Further to the skills relating to their qualifications and industry, the project aims to develop other personal, social and employability skills valued by employers that a traineeship, and particularly a work experience abroad, offers such as self-management, teamwork, leadership, communication, problem solving, decision making and organisational skills. It will provide the learners with a better understanding of the workplace skills needed and how to learn from the placement to set career-related goals.\r\n\r\n'SEE 2' will also impact on the professional development of staff through the upskilling of staff in all partners. Each flow of 10 or more learners will be accompanied by 2 staff members per week. As well as personal skills and enhanced cultural awareness, the staff will be able to access industry information which will help to update their knowledge in an EU context; and improve technical ability which will all contribute to curriculum development in terms of content, delivery and introducing an EU dimension.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term the project will allow the College to develop its capacity to deliver a quality curriculum and European opportunities for staff and students. It will contribute to the College's main objectives as set out in the College Development Plan - \"To improve the quality and relevance of education and training by providing a curriculum that will inspire, transform and enrich\", and \"To tackle the skills barriers to employment and employability\".", "http://www.serc.ac.uk", "South Eastern Regional College", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA102-035530_coordinator"], [2018, "Ambassadeurs voor Europa door Erasmus+ : beter onderwijs  voor iedereen door kennisuitwisseling in Europa", "South Eastern Regional College", 257573.0, 12, 25, "\"Every student internationally  competent \"  is  Friesland College's slogan in the upcoming policy plan in 2018.

Our strategic partnerships strenghten the bond with our partners abroad. Curriculum comparison and exchange of good practice enriches our educational programmes.  Students share their experiences with peers and on social media and their enthousiasm make them the best Ambassadors for Europe. We want our students to get acquainted with European values and to get used to working with people from different cultures.

Communication skills, using English in a natural setting, meeting young people in other countries, being part of their peer-to-peer training in social entrepreneurship are themes within this programme. Developing personal leadership in a programme of excellence enables them to follow a path of growth, on a multisectoral level. Teachers and students will be trained abroad within the companies involved.  This training enables students to start up companies while studying.  The collaboration with Higher Education students will be extented.

This group will be accompanied by 2 professionals. An elaborate selection procedure and extensive preparation is part of the allocation proces. \r\n\r\nInternationally competent students demand international competent teachers. Personal and professional development  is becoming increasingly important in relation to Excellence and quality control and in view of their role as Ambassador.  The professionals are well aware of the importance of their input and influence on the educational programmes.\r\nImproving the educational proces and stimulating new innovative approaches in education  within Europe through curriculum comparison,  exchanging of good practice, jobshadowing,  workshops are part of the assignments for our staff.

On one hand, it launches a series of actions directed to teaching staff, so that through the realization of job shadows (three mobilities at homologous centers in Ireland and France), they can learn the strategies and methodologies of other educational systems and incorporate them into the teaching practice in the JC1. The other aspect is that of carrying out 10 students' mobilities in two modalities: short stays (FCT) and ErasmusPro, which will allow them to carry out work placements to improve their professional skills in companies of the respective fields in Italy, Holland and Portugal.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the project will allow the educational community of our center to:\r\n\r\n- Increase the quality of Vocational Training Education by comparing educational systems in different countries and applying new techniques that improve professional profiles, fostering the optimal development of professional skills.\r\n\r\n- Develop the professional, personal and social skills of students in the international arena. Undoubtedly teamwork and coordination with European partners will be key to achieving the objectives, enhancing professional profiles and giving them meaning.\r\n\r\n- Offer opportunities to eliminate social inequalities for socially disadvantaged students who, thanks to the project, can reorient their future to find the necessary support for it.\r\n\r\n- Enhance the personal and social growth of the participants through cultural and linguistic immersion in other European societies, while at the same time developing respect, tolerance and equality.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project on our institution will be the updating and innovation of methods, which will increase the quality of the teaching. It will also increase the motivation of students, which will improve their professionalism and allow them to be more competitive in the workplace.
