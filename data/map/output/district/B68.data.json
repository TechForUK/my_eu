We  offer a range of innovative and flexible day and support services to people with learning disabilities, supported by a team of paid staff and volunteers.\r\n\r\nOur organisational objectives are:\r\n\u2022 to give service users the same opportunities as non-disabled people\r\n\u2022 to promote the integration of service users into the local community\r\n\u2022 to challenge any discrimination and marginalisation faced by this disadvantaged group.  \r\n\r\nThe philosophy underpinning the entire organisation is that of inclusion, and this philosophy is fundamental to all of the activities we provide and the way in which we interact with all those who come into contact with the organisation.\r\n\r\nWe offer EVS placements of between 9 and 12 months to a maximum of 6 volunteers from any eligible country.  Volunteers taking part in this project work alongside paid staff and other volunteers to provide a varied, stimulating and interesting programme of community-based leisure and social activities for people with learning disabilities.  \r\n\r\nThe aniticiapted outcomes of the project are:\r\n\u2022 to give weight to the fight against marginalisation of disadvantaged groups of people\r\n\u2022 to promote cultural diversity and exchange\r\n\u2022 to foster a heightened sense of European citizenship amongst all parties\r\n\u2022 for the volunteers to give \u2018added value\u2019 to Options for Life\u2019s activities\r\n\u2022 for the dissemination of good practice across Europe within the social care, disability and inclusion field\r\n\u2022 to improve the employability of the volunteers, thus tackling (in a small way) the issue of youth unemployment\r\n\u2022 to develop the volunteers\u2019 personal and social skills\r\n\u2022 to develop the volunteers\u2019 independent living skills\r\n\u2022 to promote the participation of young people", "http://www.optionsforlife.info", "Options for Life", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA105-000115_coordinator"], ["8ED", "L\u00e4ra av varandra - \u00f6kad kvalitet genom jobbskuggning 2017-2019", "Our Lady and St Huberts Catholic Primary School and Teaching Alliance", 29186.0, "The Childcare and Education department of Eskilstuna Municipality in Sweden has the ambition to continuously develop and improve the quality of teaching, improve the results and give the pupils a good foundation in order for them to succeed with future education and work.    The department has a lot of experience with international projects and we know that we can learn a lot from our colleagues in Europe.  The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other in order to develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and this job shadowing project is part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe consortium consists of the Childcare and education department and five schools: Lagersbergsskolan, H\u00e5llsta skola, Fristadsskolan, Skogstorpsskolan and Djurg\u00e5rdsskolan.  During the years 2017 \u2013 2019 we are planning to send a total of 22 staff members from these schools on job shadowing activities in Birmingham (head teachers, deputy head teachers, leaders of learning, teachers of Swedish as a second language and also special pedagogy teachers).   They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.  We especially want to focus on methods and tools involving ICT.\r\n\r\nAfter the job shadowing activities the school development will progress at the individual schools, based on the needs of the school, what experience and knowledge that the staff has gained and also based on the reflections of what already works well.  Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.   We hope that this project will help give the pupils a good foundation to stand on so that they can succeed in their future education and working life.", "http://www.st-huberts.sandwell.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-SE01-KA101-034303_3"], ["9BG", "What makes the difference", "Lightwoods Primary School", 75091.0, "The project entitled 'What makes the difference' aims to observe, shadow and learn from best practice in 4 countries focusing on Learning, Assessment for learning, pupil independence, metacognition, learning outdoors and creative learning approaches.Through collaboration it aims to develop pedagogy and practice to address teaching standards and basic skills to address the needs of staff, pupils and the school. All countries have been actively involved in innovative practice to develop pedagogy and creative learning opportunities for pupils.   We therefore plan to look at 'What makes the difference' with a real focus on how schools have developed the most effective curriculum, pupil independence, critical thinking and teaching strategies of feedback, metacognition and peer learning.ContextRecognising the high Pisa scores of schools in Scandinavia the project aims to research what makes the difference in supporting teaching and learning particularly in the basic skills. This linked to international research on the most effective teaching and learning strategies we aim to research what makes a difference in each of our partner countries.It will also look at how best practice can support transition between phases of education from primary to secondary and ensure continued progress and learning for pupils.ObjectivesOur objectives are to observe best practice at a transnational level from outstanding schools and develop our own practice with pupils based on observation, shadowing and training.Our objective is to develop new and enhanced pedagogy and practice based on our learning activities and research.Research will measure impact on the improved quality of teaching and acquisition of basic skills by pupils as they engage in learning.This practice will be shared through a range of intellectual outputs and dissemination activities.ParticipantsAre from the UK, Iceland, Finland and Spain.All participants have experience in collaboration and a range of transnational activity,Birmingham City University in the UK and the Key in London will support the projects research activity, measuring of impact and publication of results and outcomes.ActivitiesTeachers will take part in training and shadowing opportunities to enable them to reflect and evaluate on practice and develop projects to undertake with pupils in their own schools,Teachers will visit each country for training and shadowing and then trial project activities in their own schools the outcomes of which will be shared and case studied.  4 activities and projects.Project meetings each year and at the end of the project will allow project work and activities to be collated and give time for evaluation and reflection and share impacts.MethodologyMain activities will include training and work shadowing followed by project activities in each school.The project will involve Birmingham City University who will develop  research instruments, monitoring and evaluation systems designed to support assessment and evaluation of the project annually to ensure quality.  All countries will contribute to this process.The Key in London will support the project by researching the learning and writing case studies of practice.The project will develop 3 intellectual outputs:1. case studies of all training and project activities.2. assessment and research supported by the University to measure impact and outcomes.3, teachers will provide materials which support training and delivery which will be collated to produce a resource toolkit to support other schools,Results and impactNew and enhanced pedagogy to support teaching and learning, published research and case study results and a toolkit with teaching and training resources.New and increased teaching and learning strategies and skills and integration of best practice.DisseminationWill take place in each country with schools sharing the project activity and learning both locally, regionally and nationally.In England the work will be shared through the Teaching school and results used to support training and development of teachers.Intellectual outcomes including research publications and toolkit will support the ongoing development of teaching and learning strategies and teacher training.The partnership is planning an innovation conference at the end of the project to disseminate learning across partner countries.Potential long term benefitsDeveloped new pedagogy and practice based on best international practice from the 4 participating countries.Improved quality of teaching and outcomes for pupils in basic skills as a result of project learning and outcomes,Research and case study publications available to support continuing professional development and teaching and learning strategies.", "http://www.lightwoods.sandwell.sch.uk", "Lightwoods Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA219-024383_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B68"}
