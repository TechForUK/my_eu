It also aims to further enrich the school's European dimension by working closely with European schools to share good practice in curriculum, teaching and learning and embed this in our school systems.\r\n\r\nBoth teaching and and non  teaching staff  in school will benefit from this project by improving their skills in delivering outdoor learning, enhancing their knowledge and understanding of European teaching strategies and improve their professional skills in working with colleagues at European level.\r\n\r\nThis will be achieved by staff conducting focused structured job shadowing activities in our partner schools over two years. This will be followed by them implementing what they have learned in their teaching back at school. to improve their teaching and giving memorable learning experiences to our pupils.  Staff will network comprehensivel with their European colleagues throughout the project to engage in professional dialogue at a higher European level.\r\nAll strategies will be disseminated to all staff and will be implemented as part of our new outdoor learning curriculum.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the project, the school will further enhance the innovative curriculum we offer our pupils by having a comprehensive outdoor learning scheme of work in place and delivered as part of our pupils curriculum entitlement. The school's work on the European dimension will be further enhanced by staff and pupils gaining knowledge of European school systems, curricula and teaching strategies.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that through this project both staff and pupils will benefit in the long term by engaging in meaningful outdoor\r\nlearning activities.
