It involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to a temperature of 200 to 320 \u00b0C. As a result, the biomass looses all its moisture and becomes easy to grind and water resistant, which reduces the risk of spontaneous ignition and biological degradation and permits outdoor storage. By combining torrefaction with pelletisation or briquetting, biomass is converted into a high-energy-density commodity solid fuel or bioenergy carrier with superior properties in view of (long-distance) transport, handling and storage, and also in many major end-use applications (e.g., co-firing in pulverised-coal fired power plants, (co-)gasification in entrained-flow gasifiers and combustion in distributed pellet boilers. Moreover, torrefaction-based bioenergy carriers may form a good starting point for biorefinery routes.\n\nThe current SECTOR project is focussed on the further development of torrefaction-based technologies for the production of solid bioenergy carriers up to pilot-plant scale and beyond and on supporting market introduction of torrefaction-based bioenergy carriers as a commodity renewable solid fuel.

The primary objective is to decrease the cost of capture down to 15\u20ac/tCO2. CESAR aims at breakthroughs via a combination of fundamental research on Advanced Separation Processes (WP1), Capture process modelling and integration (WP2) and Solvent process validation studies (WP3) with duration tests in the Esbjerg pilot plant.   CESAR will build further on the successes and high potential ideas from the FP6 integrated project CASTOR. Moreover, the pilot built in this project will be used for CESAR. Novel activities and innovations CESAR focuses at are:  -Novel (hybrid) solvent systems -New high flux membranes contactors -Improved modeling and integration studies on system and plant level -Testing of new solvents and plant modifications in the Esbjerg pilot plant   In the Esbjerg Pilot novel technologies are assessed and compared with mainstream techniques to provide a fast track towards further scale-up and demonstration.   CESAR unites leading organisations within the field of CO2 capture, covering the whole value chain from research institutes to end-users. The consortium consists of 3 research organizations, 3 universities, 1 solvent supplier, 1 membrane producer (SME), 3 equipment suppliers, 2 oil and gas companies and 6 power generators (= industrial commitment).", 29004.0, 5711507.0, "CESAR", "Preventing emissions from reaching the atmosphere", "Scientists developed cost-effective technology to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced when fossil fuels are burned for electricity. Preventing release into the atmosphere will have significant positive impact on global climate change.", "Power plants that burn fossil fuels to produce electricity are responsible for the vast majority of man-made CO2 emissions worldwide. The role of CO2 in global warming and climate change is now widely accepted and the EC has set ambitious targets for emissions reduction.\n\nPost-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the best way to accommodate existing (via retrofit) and new fossil fuel-based plants in curbing emissions during the transition to alternative sources of fuel. Although technically feasible, a major obstacle to widespread implementation has been the cost of capturing CO2. A large European consortium developed technology to overcome this barrier with EU funding of the 'CO2 enhanced separation and recovery' (CESAR) project.\n\nPost-combustion CO2 capture exploits amine-based solvent solutions. An amine-CO2 complex is formed which can then be decomposed with heat to produce high purity CO2 and the regenerated amine. The latter can be recycled for use in the capture process.\n\nCESAR investigated a number of potential solvents and capture process models through experimentation and modelling. Calculations suggested that the CESAR process could reduce the costs of CO2 capture by approximately 20 % compared to the benchmark capture process. The most promising combinations were tested at pilot plant scale paving the way for large-scale demonstrations.\n\nIn addition, scientists conducted pioneering work in the field of emissions measurements. It enabled them to provide significant input to the European Technology Platform for Zero Emission Fossil Fuel Power Plants (ZEP), supporting CCS to combat climate change. CESAR is one of the projects helping to set the research agenda on this pivotal topic.\n\nCESAR provided technology for the post-combustion capture of CO2 from fossil fuel-based power plants with a significant cost savings compared to current processes.

Cuenca is facing a stage in which the migration rate has reached 28.8% since the crisis began. This has meant that the town council of Cuenca is ready to do everything in its power to help alleviate the discontented situation which the city is experiencing. One of these initiatives is through the CUENCA PLUS project, which supports the economic and social development of the municipality through quality education and training.\r\n\r\nAccording to studies conducted by their own City Council, the causes of unemployment and the subsequent migration of young people from the town are due to many factors including: the failure of the education system with a high dropout rate, inadequate employment policies, the existing widespread discontent in the town and the lack of expertise of young people. That is why the City Council has decided to give a boost to the educational system of the municipality, by reinforcing and supplementing it with periods of practical training in companies in other EU countries, which mean further improvement upon the current intermediate level training and training employment.\r\n\r\nThe town council of Cuenca has suggested to 3 local institutions the creation of a Consortium formed by the City Council of Cuenca, IES Pedro Mercedes, IES San Jos\u00e9 and CEOE CEPYME Cuenca to assist in the development of the CUENCA PLUS project.\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at 25 young people at intermediate level who are pursuing their final year or who are undertaking a course of preparation for employment leading to a Certificate of Competence.

The idea for this project came from the very positive feedback from students and accompanying staff following the mobility project developed by our Construction department. The current project aims to further internationalise our college by inviting several departments to send out students. We find it important that our students gain European experience and see their profession in a European context and thus contribute to the objectives of Education and Training established in the ET2020 strategy.  The Europass Mobility Document and the Certificate of Attendance issued by the German partners at the end of the mobility programme will be a plus in the learners' portfolio, fostering their personal and professional development.The training content is tailor made for each flow/curricular area and  includes learning new green technologies for the construction and automotive sectors as used in Germany, learning traditional methods of sheet metal work used side by side with modern techniques such as laser cutting, learning to work in an international business environment , learning local cuisine-specific processes and hands-on practice in German companies. Germany has been chosen for our mobility project because we would like our students and accompanying staff to experience the German \u00b4dual \u00b4vocational training system, which is seen as a successful European model of vocational training and which results in one of the lowest youth unemployment rate in the EU. As far as the project \u00b4s impact is concerned, the immediate benefits would include: increased self confidence for our students, losing their fear of travelling or job searching abroad, opening their horizons through travelling abroad, learning about a different culture and comparing work-related and other mentalities. The envisaged long term impact at participant level would be that the learning outcomes from this overseas work experience will enhance the participants\u00b4 opportunity for future employment in both the UK and the European labour market.At organisational level  we hope this project will lead to the possibility for developing other mobility, or partnership projects in the future.
