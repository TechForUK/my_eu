It will be held in a place made for residency next to Lyon in Haute-Loire. It can be defined by three main axes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of all the \"collaborative experience\": The main goal of the workshop is to share our experiences of filmmaking as a collaborative research and decision process, where everyone's word is listened and considered in a positive way. Opening new horizons for audiovisual creation, we decided to mix a large panel of arts and skills. Eventhough, the audiovisual creation is the central object of the project, it must be intended in a much broader meaning: the technical quality of the film made by participants aren\u2019t as important as the experience itself. Filmmaking becomes a mutual responsibility, emulating connexions between people, connexions between ideas, and as such a great tool for collective experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreation is thus the final product of the workshop. Since the participants come with a great panel of different backgrounds, the staff will leave the maximum total freedom about the content of the works. We expect that each artists will infuse the final result with his/her own personnality and desires. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the project is about sharing. Sharing the same space and the same process, despite our the cultural differences, we will be trussed in a common involvement of respecting some human values and endeavouring to understand eachother needs, in terms of both aspects: living and creating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project can see with three times : \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- In the first time, we'll present the programme, the aims of the workshop and develop a collective dynamic. There will time for the presentations of the associations, the countries, the participants and their artistic fields. A collaborative experience is at first a human incounter, and the expression of a commun interest and desire.  Our Project is build on this idea, thus we will leave the proper time for the youth workers to get to know themselves and think of the type of collaborative experience they wil leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - In the a second time, participants will have the times to bring their own theorical and pratical contributions about audiovisual creation. As a preparation, we ask them to write a short presentation about their activity as youth workers and artistic work. It's an efficient way to know each other and rich personal experience.During the first three days, we'll have short trainings with camera, sound gears, editing system, and the tools and competences we'll have with them. We won't provide a full technical training and to bring up the issues oaf audiovisual creation and its encounter with other arts and practices, as well as its great potential as a tool for youth workers. The game of the reel is a good example : spreading a wool reed between the participants as they speak and discuss about their activity and the projects they will build together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- The third part of the workshop will be the making of the audiovisual creations. We plan a time for the presentation of the main themes of Erasmus +. We'll leave some to the participants to think about it and then have a discussion about them and how to work with it through the audiovisual projects. Groups will be freely made, with a staff referent for each one. The main idea is to get the participants responsible, and leave the confront with issues of collaboratives experience, although we'll provide a methodological and technical support.

We will also organize a public presentation of the works for the inhabitants of the village nearby, screen the creations with our traveling theater or put in the public space the installations and works made by the participants.

It is now more important than ever to challenge a narrative in which refugees, migrants and minorities are a danger to European society. The main objective of this project, which aims at creating unity within diversity, is to exchange ideas, create a vision and strategies to counter racism and to offer support to refugees and NGOs. The training gives project partners the opportunity to come together to gain new skills in anti-racism and to tackle hate speech, to gain and share knowledge, ideas and best practice on diverse refugee issues, and to outline a Europe-wide and individual organisational strategy that charts actions to be undertaken in the near future. \r\n\r\nMain objectives \r\n1.

The cooperation shows that the mobility projects assist the students in determining their choice of education as well as retaining them at college. The strategic goal of the consortium for 2015-2020 is to increase the international activities, and we are applying for 35 student mobilities in 2016-2017 and 50 in 2017-2018. However, as a result of recent reforms of VET, the quality has to meet the new learning objectives defined by the Ministry. We are developing a programme together with Intuition London (copy enclosed) where the Danish curriculum is transferred to a British context focusing on Cross-cultural Studies and Marketing. Apart from the curriculum, students will be working on practical assignments, cases and cooperating with British students from Barnet & Southgate College and Brighton City College respectively, just as they will be doing one week of training in companies in London or Brighton. An important part of the mobility project is to encourage students\u2019 to train abroad, for instance through the Work Placement Abroad Programmme. The Europe 2020 strategy dictates that \u2018before 2020 an average of at least 6 per cent of the 18 to 34 years\u2019 olds who have completed the basic VET programme  must have studied or trained (including outplacements) at least two weeks or less if documented by a Europas\u2019. The mobility is placed during the students\u2019 second year to ensure that they can prepare, integrate and process the competences achieved during the mobility project in their further studies and training.  Experience shows that the competences acquired abroad are projected in their future studies, exams and search for apprenticeships as well as encourages lifelong learning and mobility. At the moment, the consortium is not planning to take on incoming mobility. The implementation of the new VET reforms is extremely time consuming and the consortium does not wish to put any further work pressure on the colleges.  We need to ensure that quality of the mobility projects before taking on incoming mobility.  The mobility projects increase the focus on internationalisation within the colleges and when students return to college with a new and larger perspective, staff competences must be developed too. Therefore, we wish to send 2 teachers 2 weeks at the time, one after the other, to the destinations, rather than just a couple of days as in previous years. The teachers will support our students during the entire stay, but will also participate in classes and visit students during the work training. This way, the teachers will develop their English profiency and gain new cross-cultural competences which they can implement in their classes upon their return and thereby assist in raising the bar of international perspective of vocational education.With regard to internationalization, Aarhus Business College and Tietgen cooperate strategically with Aalborg Handelsskole (AH), including curriculum, couse contents and preperation of students. As AH still has not have a Charter, AH applies for mobility funding on their own.Due to the increased focus on staff competences we are applying for 8 staff mobilities, 6 at the Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX) and 2 at the main course of VET. At HHX, many students wish to improve the possibility of being admitted into one of the international profiles at a Danish University or to a University abroad. To meet this demand, HHX has developed a new profile Global Marketing where Marketing and Cross-cultural Studies are being taught in English. Year 2013 graduate this summer and next year, HHX will be boasting six classes of this very popular profile. Therefore, teachers\u2019 linguistic skills and proficiency, cultural insight and understanding of the labour market in a European and global context are vital.  Teachers in Marketing and Cross-cultural Studies often hold an MA in Economics, European Studies, History of Ideas etc. and are familiar with the English terminology, but their proficiency is lacking.  The purpose of offering this group of teachers English courses is the ensure that they gain the English proficiency required to teach at the level defined by the Ministry.

Anne Melbourne has been our contact in the UK for all these years. The cooperation has been excellent which is why we wish to continue the project. The project will consist of 20 HG2 students and take place in Spring, 2017. The students will be carefully chosen from different classes.

Tietgen Handelsgymnasium (HHX-students)Inspired by extremely successful student mobility projects at our former Tietgen HG (now Tietgen Business), we wish to initiate as similar possibility in our HHX-department. The project will involve all our 3rd year students enrolled in our program \u2018Culture and Language (with Spanish)\u2019. This study programme includes Spanish A, Marketing A and Culture B. They have been learning Spanish for a bit over 2 years when they leave for Spain on their 3rd year. Therefore, they should have a basic understanding of the language they are going to be communication in for three weeks. The fact that Culture B is also a part of the programme is a big advantage as the students also have learned a lot about cultural differences and have a good theoretical cultural understanding. And this project will make them experience the Spanish culture and hopefully contribute to gaining a hands-on experience with cultural differences. The three week stay will consist of a one week long work placement in a local business. The local businesses will be selected by our local partner Debla in Malaga. The first two weeks of the stay will be a mix of language classes and activities involving using the Spanish language and learning about Spanish culture, the way of doing business and other relevant topics. As we wish to send 38 students from two different classes, there will be a bit of difference regarding their Spanish level. Therefore, the language teaching will take this into account as the students will be divided into groups according to level. When selecting work placements for the students, the abilities of each student will also be considered to ensure that the students do their internship in a firm where the language skills required match their skills. The students will be accompanied by teachers. Two teacher will travel with the students to Malaga and be replaced by two other teachers half way through the programme, who will travel with the students back to Denmark. 2) Staff mobility activities:In line with our current KA1 project (DAICOT) we wish to continue developing our network of partner schools with which we can arrange staff exchanges. We have chosen to bring in two partners schools that we have known for a while and collaborated on other projects/activities, but which are both new partners to us in the KA1 context. These partners are carefully selected from among a number of interesting and interested partners, which all had some relevant input to contribute with. Our two new KA1 partners we selected because of our good knowledge of the institutions, which have both been visited by Tietgen staff at previous occasions (on exchanges, study trips, project meetings etc.) and because the two institutions have very much in common with Tietgen in many ways (e.g. the subjects taught). As our current KA1 project is still running till May 2017, we are only applying for a few extra staff exchanges in this application in order to make sure that we do not ask for more than we expect to use. We have made clear agreements with all partners. In order to demonstrate how the tasks are divided among partners, we have attached a MoU of one of the staff mobility partnerships and one of the learners mobility partnerships.

The contents of the programme is currently being developed, but all topics will have an international approach, and the companies which students will be working with and visiting during the programme will all have English as their corporate language.\r\n\r\nStudents who are admitted to this programme are committed to participate in two study trips:\r\n1. a three week Erasmus+ study and training trip to London during the first term, and \r\n2. a four week study trip to an overseas destination during the third term. \r\nTherefore, AABC applies for 30 mobilities for the academic year 2017-2018 and another 30 for the academic year 2018-2019, i.e., a total of 60 mobilities. EUX Business International will be developed in cooperation with Intuition London (IL), a partner AABC has cooperated with for a great many years and who knows the vocational education and training programme very well, is familiar with the type of student at AABC, just as IL knows the staff at AABC who have enjoyed a close cooperation with the managing director at IL, Anne Melbourne, over the years.\r\n\r\nBefore the most recent reforms within vocational education and training, AABC offered carefully selected students the opportunity to attend a combined training and study trip to London during their third term. Due to new requirements in terms of curriculum, AABC and IL had to develop a new programme, which did not leave room for training as an intense focus on the academic goals was required. \r\n\r\nAs a consequence and based on AABC\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the European 2020 strategy, we wish to resuscitate the former programme with the amendments and adjustments required as we are dealing with students at their first term and students who are extremely young.\r\n\r\nThe students will be:\r\n\u2022 spending half the time in London training, and \r\n\u2022 the other half in college learning English and Marketing. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the study and training trip is:\r\n\u2022 to make students realise the value of looking for an apprenticeship immediately after the first two years of college and thereby finish the education before moving on to further education,\r\n\u2022 to inform students about and encourage them to look for apprenticeships abroad immediately after the first two years of college. \r\n\r\nUnlike former students, this group will not have been submitted to a long recruitment and screening procedure; they are going because they chose this particular programme. Furthermore, the students are young (15-16 years). Therefore, AABC has an important task convincing the students and their parents that students will be looked after 24/7. \r\n\r\nHence, accompanying staff will be at the students disposal at all times, and during the three weeks, students will be accompanied by two members of staff.  This is a unique opportunity for students and staff to get to know each other early in the programme and in a context outside college. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we apply for three accompanying staff mobilities, each will be staying one week, and another three staff mobilities who will participate in one-week courses to develop their competences, but who will also assist their colleague in the evenings and weekends planning cultural activities. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying staff will participate in all lessons at college and visit students when training in companies.  This will develop their oral proficiency and develop their intercultural competences, which they can implement in their lessons when returning to Denmark and thereby contribute to the international perspective of the programme. \r\nStaff participating in training courses will focus on:\r\n\u2022 English,\r\n\u2022 International trade,\r\n\u2022 International economics.\r\n\r\nAABC goals in terms of developing staff are ambitious.

As a consequence, xenophobic attitudes, discrimination against people with different identities and open racism have become a sad reality in schools and other places where young people of diverse backgrounds interact. Given this situation the partners in this project are convinced that European youth NGOs have to play a more active role in detecting and combatting intolerant, discriminatory and racist behavior in their own organization and the environments they are working in and look for answers to the following questions: How can we make a difference given the current challenge of increasing racism and discrimination against people of diverse background? What kind of changes are needed at structural and operational level to support organizations taking clear positions and displaying coherent behavior? How can we start reflective processes and pursue respective change in our organizations? Which processes lead to success? \r\n\r\nAgainst this background and in support of the Paris declaration of EU Education Ministers 3 years ago, the overarching aim of the project \"Be the change\" is to ensure that young people acquire social, civic and intercultural competences by promoting democratic values and fundamental rights, social inclusion and non-discrimination, as well as active citizenship. This will be done by enhancing the management, governance, innovation capacity and diversity-oriented approach of youth organisations in 11 EU countries and in Russia, providing them with tools and strategies for racism-critical and diversity-oriented change management. The project was developed as an accompanying measure in the frame of the \u201cSTAR E\u201d Strategic Partnership Project (https://stareurope.wordpress.com/) which is being implemented by ICJA with 8 partner organizations from 2017 \u2013 2020. \r\n\r\nMain project activity of the project \"Be the Change\" is a 5 day Training Seminar on diversity-oriented change management  which will take place in Berlin in February 2019 and will involve 23 participants from 12 youth organizations in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Poland, Russia, Slovakia and United Kingdom. The training programme was developed by a group of partners of the STAR E project under the guidance of two trainers of the expert organization SOCIUS in Berlin. All Partners (except SOCIUS) can count on many years of experience in international youth exchange and voluntary service programs and non-formal education in particular aiming at the inclusion of minorities and vulnerable target groups and promotion of non formal peace and diversity oriented education for young people.They recognised the need to develop concrete actions and make adjustments to their organisations in order to correspond to the challenges posed by the increasingly violent racism and to strengthen their role as facilitators of inclusion and promotors of diversity. \r\n\r\nAfter the seminar the 23 participants within their organizations are expected to devise adapted strategies to introduce and accompany change in their organizations. They will be more aware about practices of racism and discrimination in their work and organization and what they can do about it and able to apply tools and methods which have sustainable influence on their organization\u2019s sensitivity towards diversity as well as capacity to facilitate inclusion.The main innovative element is that the training sessions will constantly inter-relate the values of diversity-orientation, anti-discrimination and inclusion with the learning about change management in youth NGOs and thus will have a direct impact on the management and activities of the participating organisations.  \r\n\r\nThe training report will be published and it is expected that it will inspire other youth organizations to undertake and manage diversity-oriented and like-minded change processes which will increase the quality of youth work in Europe in the longer term.", "http://www.icye.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-2-DE04-KA105-016931_12"], ["2EG", "Minute & Artistic Metalworking II", "HOLTS ACADEMY OF JEWELLERY LTD.", 109337.0, "Our project is called \"Minute & Artistic Metalworking\u201d, or MAM-project.  \r\n\r\nThanks to this project, 41 final-year students studying clock-making or jewellery would go abroad for a two-week training.\r\n\r\nThe schools or training centres would provide a specific training linked to minute and precise metal working techniques.\r\n\r\nThe clock-making students would go to the AFPA centre in Besan\u00e7on to follow a training on finishing : they will learn how to  verify the cleanliness and freedom of mobile of the exhaust, then to ensure mechanical functions up limiting losses of the energy transmitted to the regulating body. Then, they will learn more about the movements, the faces and the hands and how to deal with a waterproof problem.\r\n\r\nThe jewellers will learn various techniques with our partners in France, Spain, Portugal and the UK. These techniques include lost wax, enamelling , filigree and CAD. In each of these training, the students will learn more about the specificities linked to working the metal, the techniques used in order to transform it into a jewel and they will also learn how to manage the material, products and tools.\r\n\r\nWe also wish to enrich our students culturally and to help them discover another part of Europe. They will learn about the architecture, the history, and the traditions in this part of Europe. We are certain that the contacts they will make with the people from there will be enriching and mind-opening.\r\n\r\nThe trip will take place in spring 2019. It will be prepared, both by the teachers in our school, IATA, and the people responsible for their training either at AFPA or in the diverse jewellery schools. The students will be assessed by the partners and the knowledge and skills they acquire there will be highlighted and acknowledged through their marks in their school reports.\r\n\r\nWhen they come back, not only will they have learned new techniques, but they will also have changed their vision of Europe and of their European identity. They will also know more about the importance of acquiring skills through training and professional life. We are confident that this stay will also provide them with new experience in relationships, teaching them about how to behave in society and boosting their self-esteem.\r\n\r\nThanks to all this, the students will have more strings to their bow which shall enable them to be more competitive on the job market, since they will be more qualified and will prove international experience.

The cooperation shows that the mobility projects assist the students in determining their choice of education as well as retaining them at college and ensuring they exploit their full learning potential. The strategic goal of the consortium for the period 2015-2020 is to increase the coherence between the topics English and cross-cultural understanding in our international activities.\r\n\r\nVocational Education and Training Programme (EUX):\r\nAn important part of the project is to increase the activities, and consequently EUX-Business apply for 45 mobilities for the period 2018-2019 and another 45 mobilities for 2019-2020. During the past two years, we have developed a programme together with Intuition London and City College Brighton where the curriculum has been transferred into a British context focusing on the topics Cross-cultural Studies and Marketing. The programme meets the learning objectives for the two topics as defined by the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, the students will be working with practical assignments and cases, just as they will be cooperating with students from Barnet & Southgate College and Brighton City College respectively. In addition to this, they will be doing one week of training in local companies. The progression of the programme will be accelerated through the shift between theory and practical assignments in a foreign context and a foreign language.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the mobility project is to encourage students to train abroad, for instance via the Training Abroad Programme. The Europe 2020 Strategy dictates, \u201cbefore 2020 an average of at least 6 per cent of the 18 to 34 years\u2019 olds who have completed the basic VET programme must have studies or trained (including outplacements) at least two weeks or less if documented by a Europass\u201d. The mobility is placed during the students\u2019 second year to ensure that they can prepare, integrate and process the competences acquired abroad are projected in their future studies, exams, and search for apprenticeship positions as well as encouraging lifelong learning and mobility.\r\nAt the moment, the consortium is not planning to take on incoming mobility. The implementation of the new VET reforms is extremely time consuming and the consortium is under the impression that it will cause great difficulties finding British students who match the theoretical levels of the EUX, and we must ensure the quality of the mobility projects before taking on incoming mobility.\r\n\r\nThe Higher Commercial Examination Programme (HHX):\r\nAfter many years of experience from VET in acquiring language skills and cross-cultural understanding, AABC now wishes to extend the Erasmus+ programme to include the HHX. Consequently, we apply for two flows of 25 students for three-week mobilities in Brighton in cooperation with Greater Brighton Metropolitan College (GBMC); 25 mobilities for the period 2018 to 2019 and 25 mobilities for the period 2019 to 2020. These students, all of great academic potential, have chosen the Global Marketing Programme at AABC where topics such as Marketing and International Economics are taught in English. At GBMC,  theory will be supported by at least one week of training in relevant, local companies, thus increasing the students\u2019 language skills, cross-cultural understanding and insight. The practical and real-life work experiences constitute the core of the academic progression during the mobility as well as after where it will be included in classes back in Denmark. \r\n \r\nThe mobility projects at EUX-Business and HHX increase the focus on internationalisation among faculty at the colleges and when students return to college with a new and larger perspective, faculty competences must be developed too. Therefore, we wish to extend the period the accompanying teachers usually stay in London and Brighton to cover the entire period of the mobilities, i.e., teachers staying end to end, one week at the time, rather than a couple of days as in previous years. Faculty will be there to support our students, and will also participate in classes, and visit students when they are training in companies. This will boost the language skills of our faculty and develop their cross-cultural competences, which they can implement in classes upon their return to Denmark, thus contributing to emphasizing the international perspective of our programmes.", null, null, "erasmus_2018-1-DK01-KA116-046933_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1126.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_3888", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 2184.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_10346", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 2962.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_36054", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1278.0, "Ensuring effective, efficient and reliable controls (17.04.03)", "fts_2016_42730", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 6034.0, "Supporting better environmental governance and information at all levels (07.02.03)", "fts_2016_45188", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 577.0, "Support expenditure for Erasmus+ (15.01.04.01)", "fts_2016_46032", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 469.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2016_48205", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1711.0, "Better climate governance and information at all levels (34.02.03)", "fts_2016_56836", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 166.0, "Free movement of workers, coordination of social security schemes and measures for migrants, including migrants from third countries (04.03.01.03)", "fts_2016_66073", 2016], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 9031.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_6122", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 12700.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_14245", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1160.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_27687", 2017], ["6PA", "JINGA FILMS LIMITED*JINGA", 5033.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_28615", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 528.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_29351", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 258.0, "Free movement of workers, coordination of social security schemes and measures for migrants, including migrants from third countries (04.03.01.03)", "fts_2017_39695", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1033.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_43380", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1072.0, "Providing quality statistical information, implementing new methods of production of European statistics and strengthening the partnership within the European Statistical System (29.02.01)", "fts_2017_45546", 2017], ["4TA", "INTER-CULTURAL YOUTH EXCHANGE LTD", 6172.0, "Promoting excellence and cooperation in the European youth area and the participation of young people in European democratic life (15.02.01.02)", "fts_2017_45760", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 300.0, "Ensuring effective, efficient and reliable controls (17.04.03)", "fts_2017_47046", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 1027.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_52130", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 475.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Direct research\u2019 policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2017_55342", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 205.0, "Support expenditure for European Social Fund and non-operational technical assistance (04.01.04.01)", "fts_2017_60425", 2017], ["1QD", "INTERLANGUAGE TRANSLATION LTD*ILTGROUP", 102.0, "Translation expenditure (31.01.08.01)", "fts_2017_68752", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "NW6"}
