Flybrid's KERS product will provide a low-cost, short-payback fuel saving product for which there is significant market appetite. Fuel savings also equate to the global issue of CO2 and emissions reduction. The product will be primarily developed by Flybrid, supported by European tier 1s and OEMs in the commercial vehicle industry.\n\nThe study will look at a number of key areas across a range of trucks/buses models and OEMs:\n- fuel and CO2 savings\n- KERS product cost\n- commercial attractiveness to both the vehicle purchaser and across the full supply chain\n- market size and growth opportunities\n\nThe study is expected to show that a simple, low-cost product can be developed that will:\n- offer 20% fuel and CO2 savings\n- deliver a <3 year payback on the KERS system cost to truck / bus operators\n- generate significant market pull and volume growth (10k units rising to 50k units at maturity)\n- create substantial incremental revenue and profit generation within the full value chain (almost entirely based within the EU).\n- achieve \u20ac38mil profit across the supply full chain at 10k units/annum with the mature potential for \u20ac180mil at 50k units/annum\n\nIt is likely that phase II funding would be sought to support the progression of the opportunity.", 42756.0, 61080.0, "FLYwheel", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_207967_916988240"], ["7UX", "ADvancing user acceptance of general purpose hybridized Vehicles by Improved Cost and Efficiency", "Torotrak (Development) Limited", "ADVICE aims at increasing the number of HEVs up to 10% of all vehicles registered in the mid-term range. This will be achieved by focusing on a market segment called \u201cpremium class\u201d, which covers medium class, upper medium class and luxury vehicles up to SUVs. This segment is facing severe problems in reaching European environmental exhaust targets, when running on fossil fuel only, not the least due to the considerable vehicle weight.\n\nIn ADVICE three physical demonstrator vehicles are built, ranging from mild-hybrid, plug-in-hybrid to full-hybrid and \u2013 concerning fuel type \u2013 from gasoline to diesel-driven.\nIn addition, it will be shown that the whole range in between these demonstrator vehicles can be well covered by means of validated simulation, yielding a complete coverage of the whole \u201cpremium class\u201d segment.\n\nADVICE aims for a reduction of exhaust and CO2 emissions on WLTP of 20% and a 25% increase in electric driving range for P-HEVs at a maximum premium cost of 5% for HEV (15% for P-HEV) with respect to the best in-class non-hybrid diesel vehicles. Particular attention is devoted to optimum driveability and drive performance, which are essential when purchasing a \u201cpremium class\u201d vehicle and thus crucial to achieve the market penetration aimed at. These objectives will be accomplished by:\n* Architecture-level  hybrid powertrain solutions, suited to be modularly applied to different segments  to increase their volumes while reducing costs\n* Advanced predictive control strategies and model predictive control strategies, taking the entire vehicle into account (not only the hybrid part)\n* Novel optimised approaches in the aftertreatment system\n* Newly developed high-temperature electronics, enabling novel strategies and approaches for energy- and thermal-management\n* Multi-core processor architectures, enabling sophisticated control strategies and models processed on-board the vehicles\n\nADVICE results will be verified through vehicle validator independent tests", 594873.0, 11100910.0, "ADVICE", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_208459_922161832"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["6TW", "More Positive Together", "Lancashire Sport", "This project brings together Social Housing Organisations from across Lancashire with a combined portfolio of over 61,220 properties located in the 20% most deprived Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in Lancashire.
