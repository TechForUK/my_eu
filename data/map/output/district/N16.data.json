Our children have been enthused by language teaching and it has been wonderful to see staff delivering this new curriculum area with such confidence and accuracy.  Our work has enabled us to access the expertise of Spanish teachers across the borough and we have already made a number of purposeful links with local secondary schools, inviting Key Stage 3 students and their Spanish teachers, to work with our children across the school to further enhance their Spanish skills.  Further to this, we have also made an international link with a Primary school in Madrid.  Our year 4 children have already sent and received letters and will continue to use this as a means to develop their skills in writing Spanish which in turn will enable the children at our link school to develop their own written English skills.  The children across the school have also benefitted from this link and we have been able to use media clips of the Spanish school\u2019s celebrations to further our own children\u2019s intercultural breadth of awareness.  Funding will enable key members  of staff, as part of the organised course, to visit the school in Madrid, strengthening the link, observing teaching methods and disseminating their approaches to staff and using the observed experiences of the children there to inform greater contextual relevance for our Spanish lessons and more developed cultural understanding at a more personalised level for each child. \r\nWe are aware that we need to continue to develop staff at all levels to be able to take part in embedding the European/Spanish dimension across the curriculum.  To this end, we hope that by participating in further courses, more staff will engage with developing the use of Spanish across the curriculum.  We also aim to use these courses to support the ongoing professional development of staff, particularly in project management, curriculum planning and the leading of working groups.  As the majority of teaching staff are not Spanish speakers, the courses and experiences accessed as a result of funding will enable a more self-informed approach to Spanish teaching and though the coordinator would still lead this curriculum area, individual staff would be able to bring their own developed skills to enhance the quality of the MFL curriculum for which they are responsible for delivering.\r\n Our school is very much a community school where parents and carers are engaged in a real way with the work of the school and we aim to involve them in such things as curriculum days and special events such as Hispanic weeks and international evenings.

Our training is a stepping stone for young people who fall within this group, to support them to develop their basic skills, and build their confidence and soft skills. The activities we provide are a progression route for the young people we engage, and we aim to put them in a stronger position to access training or employment opportunities in the future.  We are accredited to deliver an Award 'Life & Living Skills' (Entry Level 3) for NEETS, which offers a suite of units across a wide range of skills areas. The courses are tailored to our learners, and we opt for the units that best respond to their needs, ranging from 'the world of work, 'numeracy', 'IT' and 'home management'. Many of the young people we work with find themselves in a Catch 22, whereby they don't have the soft skills employers are looking for but the only opportunity to gain these skills is through on-the-job experience. This project addresses participants' needs by offering a structured work placement through which participants can gain tangible work experience and develop their soft skill, self confidence and independence.We plan to send 24 young people, aged 18-24, to spend 2 weeks undertaking a structured work placement in Seville, Spain. The placements will be entry level, and will give our learners the opportunity to gain practical work experience and support their professional and personal skills development.The majority of our learners have not travelled previously. This is a realistic timeframe for tangible objectives to be achieved whilst being attainable for learners who may be apprehensive about being away from home/overseas.By offering an international work placement, we hope to raise our learners aspirations, and push them out of their comfort zone, in a structured and fully supportive environment. Participants will have carried out UK based work placements previously, and this gives them the opportunity to build on the skills they have developed, in a cross cultural environment. We will offer placements in entry level customer service and/or construction roles that have been developed with objectives that are appropriate for our target group.We will expect all learners to have completed a UK based work placement/volunteering opportunity prior to undertaking the mobility, so that they have acquired some initial work based experience and can demonstrate commitment to this type of opportunity.Through the mobility, learners will work towards learning outcomes that contribute directly to specific units of their 'Life and Living Skills' course. In this way, the mobility will be fully integrated into the learner's course of study. We intend to work closely with host organisations to provide details of learning to be acquired during the placement, and agree appropriate ways to document and evidence learning, using the ECVET methodology as a framework.We expect the impact for participants to be the development of soft skills, and increased confidence to access opportunities outside of their immediate environment. We hope the mobility will broaden their horizons and raise aspirations, giving them the chance to understand the range of different possibilities available them to them and the self belief that they are able to achieve positive outcomes within these environments.By including the mobility as an integrated component of their course of study, the impact will be to enhance and enrich their overall experience of the course and add value to the experiential learning that they achieve.At organisational level, we hope this will have a positive impact on our future strategic direction, by giving us a platform for international work and partnership development.We hope this will impact on our staffs professional development, their understanding of the needs of our learners and create opportunities for curriculum development in the future.Host organisations will gain a better understanding of our teaching approach and a course that has been specifically designed for NEET young people. It will increase their capacity to operate within the EU and with International partners, and the quality of their preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting skills for EU projects, which can be cascaded within the organisation.
