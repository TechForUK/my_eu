At Doune Primary we currently teach French from Primary 1-7 (and have introduced it in the nursery through peer teaching by our current P6 pupils). We have identified with our cluster colleagues that Spanish will be the second foreign language taught ( it is currently offered with French at our local secondary) and from this identified a need to train staff in its delivery. The objectives of our project would that we would have 3 trained members of staff teaching at a range of stages who are confident and motivated in the delivery of Spanish. The project will enable them to gain confidence in their methodology and pedagogy. Our aim would be to also feed out this training to our colleagues in other schools within our cluster.\r\nThere are 3 participants identified to take part in this training so that we can comfortably teach across all our stages and also so we can support each other in our teaching and learning of Spanish. The profile of the participants is that they are all interested in and motivated to take on this extra training and bring a diverse range of skills and knowledge.\r\nThe activity will enable us to take part in an immersion course in Spain which will increase our confidence and ability to speak and understand Spanish as well as providing us with the opportunity to create and source a range of resources when we are there to take back and use within Doune Primary. We also intend to use it as a platform for finding partners abroad which will help us develop our European and Global education programme.\r\nWe are set up with e-twinning and now want to develop this as a means of communication with other schools in the UK and abroad.\r\nWe would like to engage our pupils skills, knowledge and passion for ICT and link this with foreign language learning.\r\nThe long term benefits of this project will be the upskilling of staff and its impact on our pupils enabling them to be confident individuals and contribute positively as European citizens able to communicate confidently in a second foreign language.", null, "Doune Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035576_coordinator"], ["6BU", "French Language Training", "Doune Primary School", 6084.0, "Our aim through this project is to help develop participating members of staffs' strong desire to develop their confidence and competency levels within promoting the French language and culture. In tandem with this, their developed skills, methodology, experiences and resources will be used to enhance the learning opportunities of our school, other schools within the cluster and the wider community of our school. \r\n\r\nA key target of this project within our school is to further develop and grow links with partners and the wider community through the sharing of experiences, French culture and language at ongoing events. This will promote and encourage engagement of all partners and learners, helping to provide a more meaningful, sustainable and forward thinking approach to learning. \r\n\r\nThrough the participation of our three staff members, our school will be better suited to promote and engage learners in languages, inspiring a love of languages and diverse cultures a key element of becoming an active and successful member of the globalised society.  Further to this it will help our school reach and exceed the Scottish Governments targets for 1 +2 languages.", null, "Doune Primary School", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA101-047136_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FK16"}
