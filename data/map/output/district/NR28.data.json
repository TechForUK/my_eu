It means that we place emphasis on the increase of accuracy and quality of qualifications and teaching skills while trying to respond actively to the present tense political situation in Europe.Our project focuses on three main domains:1. Improvement of teaching competencies in language teaching 2. Multiculturalism and support of the cooperation with foreign schools3. Gaining experience with the integration of children with special educational needsWe want the project to support goals and aims of whole school. We have chosen seven teachers who were selected according to predetermined criteria. These criteria have been met by all the chosen participants who are skilled teachers with an excellent work performance and they are amongst the most experienced educators of our school. Apart from English education some criteria which are focused on teaching other foreign languages and support of teachers of non-language subjects. They may use languages when organising projects, trips, internships or when using CLIL method. The teachers  have been selected from the whole pedagogical staff, that means they are both first level and second level teachers. For these reasons the key members of the project are language teachers (English, Spanish and German language), non-language teachers, heads of departments and school management representatives. The teachers will participate in all three offered activities in the framework of the Erasmus programme supporting individual mobility of the pedagogic staff. That means they will attend language and methodology courses focusing on creative teaching students of particular age groups, shadowing at partner schools and subsequently an educational stay which allows teachers to participate in teaching experience at a partner school in the real conditions of the UK educational system.The project will be realised according to the given schedule which is managed by a project coordinator. The coordinator will plan all the activities so that the school schedule will be least affected and on the other hand, these activities should have a great impact on the school development according to the project aims. Optimisation of the funds which ensure the course and travel costs are also amongst the program coordinator competencies in cooperation with the school economist.Another important criterion is pupils\u2019 meeting living languages within international projects and trips abroad. The development of teachers\u2019 communication skills is very important also for implementing and organizing these activities. Good knowledge of foreign languages is also crucial for the management of the school, for their communication with native speakers who teach at the school, with parents of bilingual children and children from other countries and with foreign school partners.Understanding cultural differences will contribute to the mutual respect and tolerance which are very important in today's complicated period of migration crisis. We believe that this project will help all our pupils to feel good at school regardless of their nationalities or other differences.The project will also contribute to a better understanding of inclusive education. Teachers will acquire a real picture of how it is possible to implement the inclusion, how a teacher cooperates with their assistant, and what problems we may face. We can also acquire recommendations for how to solve these problems. By means of this shadowing and educational stay at our partner school the management of the school will acquire a real pictureof how inclusion is carried out in other EU countries. They will be able to compare this experience with the experience they will acquire during shadowing by the Portuguese management at our school or during informal meeting of the school management in a Maltese school during the language course. This experience will contribute to better mastering of the planned inclusion by the school management in the environment of a Czech school.Through this project we would like to contribute to raising the prestige of pedagogical work which is very demanding and like a number of other professions it requires constant self-education and following of the latest trends.The project will be realised according to the given schedule which is managed by a project coordinator. The coordinator will plan all the activities so that the school run will be the least affected and on the other hand, these activities should have great impact on the school development according to the project aims. Optimisation of the funds which ensure the course and travel costs are also amongst the program coordinator competencies in cooperation with the school economist.", "http://www.nwjun-infsfed.com", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CZ01-KA101-023453_1"], ["9HG", "Jazyky nap\u0159\u00ed\u010d Evropou", "North Walsham Junior School", 18699.0, "The project of \u201cLanguages Across Europe\u201c  is based on and develops the project of \u201cLanguages -The Road to Understanding\u201d. In this project we completed methodological courses as well as improved language competences of individual teachers. This project significantly helped us to eliminate the teachers\u00b4 fear of mobilities, such as job shadowing and or temporary work placement and these mobilities have become very challenging for our colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn the project \u201cLanguages across Europe\u201d, we would like to focus on the development of the language competences as well as on other competences related to teaching skills of the teaching stuff and managerial skills of the school management. We will be able to achieve this goal through these 8 chosen mobilities. We have chosen all options, which are supported by the Erasmus+ Programme - one language course, two methodological courses, two job shadowing programmes and three temporary work placements at various international schools. This wide range of programmes will enable us to gain a lot of knowledge, abilities and experience for our teachers\u00b4 development and thus improving the development of our school.\r\n\r\nThe title of our project \u201cLanguages across Europe\u201d implies that the individual mobilities will be put into practice in 5 different European countries \u2013 in Great Britain and Malta, where English is used as an official language, in Spain, Germany and France. In our school we teach English, Spanish, German and French. We have chosen the countries where these languages are spoken, so that the teachers can improve their teaching abilities as well as learn about the life in those countries. The personal experience of living in a foreign country will help our teachers to make their lessons more interesting and motivating for their students.\r\n\r\nThere are four international partner schools which cooperate with our school. These schools were involved thanks to our other previous projects, mobilities and other activities of our teachers. The British school has been cooperating with our school for a long time. The cooperation with the other schools in France, Germany and Malta started as we were preparing for this project. We consider the preliminary stage of our project very successful. We expect the following stages that will be conducted as scheduled above, will be successful as well. We are ready to receive the teachers from our partner schools at our school. We perceive the cooperation with the international schools and common international projects and activities as the main goals of this project.\r\nWe have chosen our language teachers and the deputy head teacher to participate in this project. The individual mobilities were designed to suit the needs of each participant. All highly experienced teachers involved in this project got a chance to take part in the Erasmus + program as a reward and an opportunity to develop their professional competences.\r\n\r\nWe expect our teachers will improve their English, Spanish, German and French language knowledge. We also expect they will get inspired in methodology and lesson planning. The knowledge of everyday life in foreign countries will improve the teachers\u00b4 competencies in this area. The understanding of cultural differences will enable us to respect and understand other cultures, which is extremely important in present time when Europe is facing European migrant crisis. We believe that this project will help us that all our students will feel comfortable no matter what their nationality is or how culturally different they are.\r\n\r\nThanks to the job shadowing and temporary work placement our teachers will acquire the idea about how the educational systems in other European countries work. They will be able to personally experience many practical aspects of education, such as lesson planning, teaching materials, school management, difficulties which the teachers may face in everyday teaching practice. We are going to use the ideas in second language lessons as well as in other school subjects. We are going to learn about the integration of very talented students as well as students with various special needs.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that the main benefit of the project will be the improvement of everyday lessons of our teachers. We believe that the creative lessons, effective time management and experienced and self-confident teachers are essential aspects our students\u00b4 motivation. It is essential that high achievements can be reached only at school in which the school management consists of highly qualified leaders, who keep up to date with their specialization as well as leading their team and pedagogical process.\r\nWe would like this project to support the transformation of our school into a \u201clearning organization\u201d. The concept of the learning organization is introduced in the book The Fifth Discipline by well respected American systems scientist Peter Senge. Creating a learning organization is the main goal of modern organizations.", "http://www.nwjun-infsfed.com", null, "erasmus_2018-1-CZ01-KA101-047314_2"]]}}, "outwardCode": "NR28"}
