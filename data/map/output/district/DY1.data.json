This will have a profound impact on education, the economy and society in the future. Technological changes will be even more pervasive and global competition will increase, not least the competition for talented people. Thus, there is an urgent need to strengthen policies to make EU ready for this competition and to give young Europeans opportunities to learn and to develop their capacities. There is a need to improve mobility both in quantity and quality at the EU level, and consequently a strong concern on the part of EU institutions to reach this goal. The overall percentage of young people which actually engages in transnational mobility activities remains low and compares unfavourably with higher education. Nevertheless, it appears with clarity that this training component is largely underdeveloped compared with other subjects in the VET-curricula. Some main barriers must be addressed if learning mobility is to be extended. The project seeks to address the above-mentioned needs and intends to respond to the Erasmus + priorities by setting the aim to improve the quality and quantity of mobility experiences adopting an integrated approach that involves both students and VET teaching staff. SKILLS + will be articulated into 2 different phases: during preliminary phase, 52 teachers will have an experience abroad and they'll jointly define with peers the contents of work placement, and the formalisation of MoU setting out the general framework of cooperation and networking between the partner institutions as well as establishing a climate of mutual trust. The second core phase of the project will be focused on the mobility experiences of 185 students from nine schools located in Vicenza its province, one located in Padua and in Verona. Learners will stay abroad for a period of 4 weeks of high quality work placement and 2 days of preparation/induction provided by partner abroad.  The project proposal intends to foster KSC,  of young learners in line with training needs of the local and global labour market. The multi- sectorial project is aimed at students who are completing the course of study and has the purpose to develop professional and soft skills, to improve the learning of foreign language and intercultural awareness. The schools involved encompass a range of professional pathways: Tourism\\Catering, Administration, Finance and Marketing, International Relations and Trade, Agriculture and Food Industry,ICT, Mechanics\\Mechatronics\\ Electronics, Transport and Logistics, Social Services and Healthcare. These sectors can be recognized as key drivers of the EU economic recovery in supporting growth and employment also for labour markets entrants. The partnership brings together 29 partners from ten different countries (IT, DE, NL, SLO,IE,UK,FI,DK,ES, FR) and is constructed with a view into achieving the highest synergies among the different partners. The methodological framework of the project builds on existing methods and practices which are already in use in the partners\u2019 countries or developed in other EU-funded projects (VQTS matrix, ECMO, TRIF, etc.) where CPV and other partner organisations are involved. In designing and implementing the mobility schemes the project will built on the assumption that modern work processes involve many similar tasks despite national differences in the manners of offering and organising training. The project proposal will be implemented through following stages: BEFORE MOBILITY mainly focused on preparation of participants, IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOBILITY ACTIVITIES and FOLLOW UP/DISSEMINATION activities. The project intends to have a significant impact on public and private key actors of the partners\u2019 countries and the respective national, regional, local.  The project contributes to enhance partners\u2019 national VET systems through:\r\n\r\n- the promotion of internationalisation and mobility strategies, linked with the quality assurance systems for placements, monitoring contents and recognition of skills acquired  abroad;\r\n\r\n- the improvement of the quality in VET also significantly contributing to the further development of the competence of staff organising mobility as well as teachers, trainers and tutors involved. The EU added value of the project is, furthermore, the support provided to the implementation of common EU tools and methods for mobility quality assurance. for the implementation of an effective ECVET system for comparability and portability of VET qualifications in full compliance with EQF principles.

This applies equally to commercial staff in international companies. Both from the perspective of the companies that are active in international markets, as well as for the professional perspective of the trainees, the need arises to acquire these skills.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nLearners should use and deepen their professional knowledge during the stay abroad.

The trainees will be selected within schools situated in the Regions of Veneto, Marche, Puglia and Sicilia, that is schools situated into three Italian territorial macro-areas (North \u2013 Center \u2013 South and Islands), involving classes of the second, third and fourth year. The project has been realised integrating scholastic realities as Italian vocational schools and VET centers and some European partners as: colleges, VET centers and associations from England, Ireland, France, Germany and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe majority of students involved in the project come from families with limited economic resources, and they often live in social need situations at the limit of isolation. These situations can cause them an economic and cultural disadvantage and limiting, in the long term, the cognitive, social and relational development.\r\n\r\nWe really believe that marrying the activities offered by vocational education and training paths with extra-scholastic actions, as the participation to an European vocational mobility project, we can produce in the students involved a positive and multiplying effect, unique of its dimension and importance.

The reinforcement of professional competences acquired at school and the acquisition of new professional competences will develop through internship activities in working contexts different from the classic scholastic ones. So, the company training represents a valuable and effective instrument to make the most of the competences acquired at school, in an international dimension.

Obesity and the associated stress in young people is a harmful process that leads to anxiety, guilt, fatalism and defeatism, low self-esteem increases and an inability to creative use of available time.\r\nThe aim of the seminar is to seek new roles for NGOs in the context of the dissemination and promotion of active and healthy lifestyle, the gain (or develop) the fashion for such behavior, providing young people with information (in the range of healthy eating habits and the need for physical activity into everyday life) spreading good practice, combining the results of the projects and participate in seminars with the obvious goal of increasing the pool of partners for future cooperation, develop networks and as a end result reliable, international cooperation organizations at various levels. \r\nWe believe that this proposal combines a number of benefits and strengthens the objectives of the program ERAZMUS +, while promoting a set of topics discussed. \r\nThe project will be implemented within 09 - 05/17/2015. \r\nThe project will be attended by 36 participants from EU countries - 14 youth organizations. In total, the project we have representatives of 10 countries (Poland, Latvia, Greece, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Spain, Lithuania, Romania, UK), which will allow for accurate study of statistical data and in-depth analysis of the issues of the project. This ensures cross-section of participants to discuss global problems and draw appropriate conclusions. \r\n\r\nAccording to the latest research in Poland, 61% of men weigh too much (45% were overweight, 17% obese), and the population of adult women are overweight or obese increased by 19 percentage points in the last 10 years. Nearly 45% of women weigh too much (30% are overweight and 15% obese). In the last ten years has shifted to the age limit of people with excess body weight, well-established, inadequate eating habits. Commonly, this problem begins to affect people under 35 years of age. \r\n\r\nParticipants of the project are youth workers and youth leaders. \r\nThe project will be mainly in the form of workshops, but the topics discussed will also be lectures and panel discussions, presentations prepared by participants, interactive discussion and exchange of experiences. A comparative analysis will be applied to the accumulated material required to draw conclusions and develop methods of strategic partnerships for future activities of the organization. \r\n\r\nAfter this project, we expect to: \r\n- Promote active citizenship among young people we work with; \r\n- The development of solidarity, tolerance and mutual understanding among young people from different countries; \r\n- Overcoming distrust of cultural differences and individual differences; \r\n- The creation of new partnerships and networks to strengthen and deepen cooperation with existing partners; \r\n- Exchange of good practices, \r\n- Know the ways and methods of activating youth groups, \r\n- Sharing the results of the project worked out with the local community in their countries, in circles close to the activities of individual organizations and for this purpose we will use a variety of tools: television, magazines, radio, Internet, talks, \r\n- Publicity of the effects of our research and thoughts as well known and proven methods in school environments (which mostly based partner organizations).", "http://www.enlight-youth.com", null, "erasmus_2014-3-PL01-KA105-013409_2"], ["4AS", "Train & Travel!

From such departments will naturally arise interesting strategic partnerships for academic innovation. To achieve this goal 11 meetings have been scheduled in 11 different countries. Xabec organizes the meeting in \"Human Factors\" and attends 9 more meetings. Xabec teachers who will use mobilities for this call are the Heads of Department and, in some cases, will travel with a collaborator.\r\n\r\n2. STUDENTS.\r\nA group of 3 students carry out three months internships in Portugal and the UK. The companies share our mobility strategy.\r\n\r\n3. STUDENTS.\r\nAnd 6 students will travel to four schools for a \u201cProjectX\u201d previously agreed and validated by both institutions (sending and receiving) with assessment and validation of learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe most important result is the consolidation of InnMain European network. All of the partners are well-known: we have worked together in the past in TOI projects, or associations. And, of course, with some we already have positive experiences of mobilities.\r\n\r\nMobilities of both teachers and students will have their prior preparation: Technical Departments have a script supervised by the Executive Board of InnMain, and students will be prepared according to standard procedure established by Xabec's Internal Rules of procedure.\r\n\r\nXabec has a International Department that will be the one responsible for the administrative management of the entire project (see presentation: http://www.xabec.es/xabec-internacional.php).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected impact on Xabec environment will be very important: \r\n- firstly, teachers are going to be involved with the international department. This sets a new challenge on continuous improvement and extra motivation to improve language skills.\r\n- In the students, because the mobilities of ProjectX will not break the ordinary rhythm of classes and do not require  a high level of knowledge in foreign languages. This has already gotten the attraction of our students, increasing the number prospective students who wish to have an international experience.\r\n- In companies related with Xabec because they ask for students with social and international skills.\r\n- In the Valencian and Spanish society in general, because we honestly think that this experience can be put as an example of good practice.\r\n- And at European level, we hope to keep increasing the number of schools participating in this project, with this tool and methodology.\r\n\r\nAs a final summary we can say that CaLoReT 2015 reflects a desire to consolidate the international dimension we want for Xabec, in the context of InnMain European network: a reliable and stable network, with a strategy perfectly aligned with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy.", "http://www.dudleycol.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA102-013718_11"], ["4AS", "Mesleki E\u011fitimde \u00d6\u011fretmen Yetkinliklerinin Artt\u0131r\u0131lmas\u0131 i\u00e7in Hizmeti\u00e7i E\u011fitim Portal\u0131", "Dudley College of Technology", 103989.0, "To train the staff and technical instructors in order to implement high  technology for the need of Turkish Industry is only possible with improved quality working teachers who need  renewed and refreshed in-services training programmes.

Enlarging one's knowledge, discovering something new and being able to look at familiar things from a different perspective and to put them into question during an exchange with people from other cultural backgrounds, these are skills which are of increasing importance in view of a rapidly changing and increasingly networked world.The objectives of our project are therefore:- Giving incentives to move into something new- Sensitizing participants for different structures and approaches by taking a different point of view- Enhancing intercultural competence by \"immersing\" in complex and different professional environments and situations- Developing and strengthening self-confidence and empowerment by engaging in different everyday lives and working structuresand by getting to know and experiencing different value systems- Enhancing perseverence and the ability to remain calm when coping with unfamiliar situations- Getting to know the languages and approaches of colleagues, business partners and customers and learning how to work and communicate in these languages without misunderstandings- Providing learners and teaching staff with skills which enable them to adapt more easily to technological and organisational changes within complex social structures and a diverse and multilingual information society- Improving the quality and efficiency of vocational training by exploiting the plurality of learning environments both at home and abroad- Improving chances, flexibility and competitiveness - employability - of young people in different professional fields on global labour markets- Encouraging learners and teaching staff to actively \"live\" mobility and cross-border cooperation by widening their perspective andtheir personal and professional range beyond national borders- Giving teachers the opportunity to explore the common work and learning place called Europe and to initiate and shape learning cooperations and networks Europe-wide- Enhancing the international orientation of our vocational school and integrating it visibly into all its fields.The project participants come from different job and training backgrounds but they all have something in common: They all learn, study and work in a multicultural environment characterized by diversity. Taking part in this project will enable them to work more efficiently in internationally orientated enterprises and organisations, especially with regard to people coming from different cultural backgrounds and speaking different languages.For the teaching staff the project offers the chance to enlarge their intercultural competence both professionally and personally in a European context, to get new input and ideas for their work and to review and reassess familiar concepts.All in all: Our main objective is to motivate students, trainees, trainers and teachers to get to know people in different cultural contexts , to exchange knowledge and experiences, to discover something new, experience diversity as a value, broaden their horizons as much as possible and use the qualifications, skills and experiences thus acquired as a basis for further learning and training. The most important topic of the project is to encourage people, regardless of age and status, to stay open-minded and curious, to discover the diversity of ways of life and of approaches, to change their familiar point of view and their learning environment which means to increase their mobility by acquiring more competences enabling them to cope with rapidly changing situations and to communicate with people world-wide.During the project different activities and measures will be carried out, e.g. work placements for students or assignments for teachers to initiate cooperations with colleagues in Europe to exchange professional knowledge, ideas and materials. Thus preparation measures accompanying the different project flows vary according to participants and include for example intercultural training and language courses.

Staff mobility includes 4 staff members (head teachers and the management) and 10 professional teachers. The aim of staff mobility is to introduce different teaching methodologies and tools, also to widen their knowledge so that it would lead to appropriate changes in our respective curricula. We hope that it would help teachers to generate new ideas on how to integrate different subjects in order to improve the teaching quality, so that the learner would be more motivated to learn, and that the knowledge would help them in the future life.

In addition, physical therapy massage, skin care before and after surgery at plastic surgery clinics and make-up of cosmetic in the performing arts can considered among the works that they can do. Thanks to qualified staffs, who have adopted their jobs, the importance of occupation and status in society has shown positive development.  As well as variety and quality also positive development observed in cosmetic products, fashion and media has been quite effective on this positive development. The demand for beauticians has increased in the result of these effects and developments and more professional structure have been formed in the profession compared with the past.\r\nThe rapid development of the profession makes a large employment field and the need of qualified personnel has been increasing. The majority of the professionals are trained with on-the- job training. The positive traces of rapidly changing and evolving technology are also found in the hairdressing profession. These developments reflect in cosmetics and electrical equipment used, increase the efficiency of the profession. Through saving time with the developing means of electrical devices, more positive results are obtained from transactions.  Hall capacities have been expanding in this occupation for customer relations are increasingly gained importance. The future trends in   Beauty and Hair Care Services is the disappearance of women and men of distinction as in many developed countries.\r\nOnes who working in the field of beauty and hair care services in larger cities follow daily fashion trends in this area through various channels. However, people working in this field but in the small towns have no such a possibilities. The persons are not able to follow closely the developments and trends in the hair care field and beautician stay out of the development of the profession and lose their jobs. This situation emerges as a loss in terms of employees and major economic loss of our country.\r\nIt is aimed with this project on-site practical and theoretical observations in their educational field of apprentices of Beauty and Hair Care Services in England, to learn the methods and techniques used, grip technological advances in this field by internship and the most important thing is to develop a new model in their future jobs through the experiences they will gain.\r\nThe Project will be delivered at Dudley College located in Dudley, England between on 04 March 2018 and 31 March 2018.

Therefore, both it is just not enough to teach the people with disabilities the best job can do but also the employment of individuals and maintaining thereof is equally important.\r\nIt is a well known fact that a right to vocational training however, considering people with disabilities especially vocational trainings and career directed of mentally disabled, this mentioned issue only have been carried out by a limited number of institutions hence, it is thought that people with mental disabilities do not enough benefit from vocational training services of apprenticeship centers and adult education centers as the other individuals benefiting from. \r\nOne of the most significant barriers to employment of persons with disabilities is the low education levels of these individuals.\r\nIt should be achieved to try to eliminate the disabilities\u2019 handicaps or where this is not possible to provide them necessary material and spiritual possibilities to be able to continue their life.

Commercial institutions use special lighting systems (lighting automation) to reduce the cost. Thus, lighting management has been developed. Lighting management can provide more than 30% energy savings, by reducing building operating costs by 10% and even more. It is possible to save energy by using the lighting method through intelligent running lights (in the right place at the right time and by providing light levels)\r\n\r\nLighting management technologies relies on the device can be used to apply a special strategy and the methods to manage these devices.

The centers where our apprentices have been trained are the vocational training centers. They will not receive any more education from any institutions after graduating their schools. Therefore, the education they obtained at the vocational training centers determines their qualifications for life.

We also mean to make our students more open to the multicultural quality of today\u2019s world.\r\n \r\nWhat is more, our mobility project is strictly related to the eTwinning project we have been involved in for several years now with our two partner schools. We believe that thanks to meeting our eTwinning partners \u201cface to face\u201d we will be able to talk about what we have already achieved, to make detailed plans for the future, see the outcomes of the project and create real, not only virtual relationship with our partners. Our eTwinning project relates to the last main goal listed above, i.e. teaching values to children and improving their behaviour, as it is based on promoting moral values such as respect, kindness, honesty, friendship and family.\r\n \r\nThe project participants are a group of eight teachers who teach different age groups and different subjects but are also representatives of the management of the school and people who provide pastoral and special needs care for the students. They do not necessarily have to know English at a proficient level. The level enabling them to communicate is sufficient. All of them are characterized by the eagerness to learn and share their knowledge with others.\r\n \r\nWe plan to organize several mobilities to our partner schools, during which we plan to: outline the mobility objectives, observe the lessons and other forms of teaching as well as  breaktime in the host schools (bearing in mind the project aims), take part in staff briefing, less formal discussions with teachers, assemblies, students\u2019 performances, see the effects of the students\u2019 work, observe the eTwinning project outcomes and finally sum up and evaluate the mobility.\r\n \r\nWe will use a number of evaluation methods to monitor the participants\u2019 progress during their mobility, such as: attendance register, two kinds of observation sheets (to be filled in by the participant and to be filled in by the project coordinator) and two kinds of questionnaires (to be done by the participant and to be done by the host school teachers).\r\n \r\nWe are absolutely sure that taking part in the Erasmus + project will be a breakthrough experience for its participants and for the entire school.

Thanks to it, our school will acquire the openness to change and improvement, and, hopefully, we will be more likely to take part in other European projects in the future. Also, through this experience we are bound to get more job satisfaction from our work as teachers.\r\n \r\nLast but not least, the project will be the only possibility for the students from disadvantaged families (unemployment, poverty, limited access to culture) to meet children from other countries through their teachers.

Especially LOs that cannot be gained in sending institutions, but the labour market needs or will need them in near future. Effective evaluation and secure validation of gained LOs gained abroad is possible thanks to using elements of ECVET. \r\nDuring preparation the learners of 40-day mobility will use OLS and have course of bilan de compet\u00e9nces (BdC) with certified BdC counsellor from KABA, in which we will use tools imported within projects SCAN (LdV TOI 2012) and CompCert (KA2 2015).

Based on the principle that Dance is an Art form that is in constant interaction with other Art disciplines we intend to develop an interdisciplinary approach by the use of acting, movement analysis and music interpretation. Through the exchange of practices, teachers\u2019 training in all dances  (classical, contemporary, improvisation, multicultural etc.) and pilot implementation of training students we will distill the best practices applicable to a variety of diverse trainees  (professionals, newcomers, beginners, amateurs, dance students, seniors, children, immigrants, disabled etc.). The teachers' training will run on two parallel levels. Firstly all partner institutions will do pilot implementation of their training techniques to the maximum of various groups of learners from different  backgrounds within their organization for a specific period. Secondly all partners will organize joint staff training events in each country in order to transfer knowledge and experience in particular training modules to the dance trainers involved in the project. Both initiatives will produce a number of  multicultural approaches which will undergo assessment and evaluation from all stakeholders in the partnership. In the end of the development of the suggested  techniques we will share and disseminate the best practices that can be  applicable both in VET and CVET.  Through the exchange of  practices we aim to utilize individual and collective experience in order to provide dance trainers with training tools applicable both on formal and non-formal education and training. Furthermore the project-based transnational collaboration will respectively facilitate the access of diverse groups of learners to high quality education and training. The partnership will increase synergies and links among dance training providers (dance companies, institutions of vocational training, cultural centers, dance schools, Colleges, companies) and promote the concept of lifelong learning. The knowledge provided by the project will enhance the effectiveness of dance trainers and choreographers, will create conditions for employability and stimulate their (re)-integration into the labor market. The richness of methods to be applied in the project will highlight the ethnographic values and cultural identity not only of the participating countries since a pool of ethnic dances will be used as a module for promoting innovative training techniques.", "http://www.dudleycol.ac.uk", "Dudley College of Technology", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA202-024504_coordinator"], ["9JF", "WE'RE SUPER", "Enlight Projects", 43345.0, "One of the most affected groups by the recent economic crisis is youth, 30% of them are at risk of social exclusion. The current situation is so dramatic for impoverished youth that they have to be supported by their parents and grandparents. They are unemployed (or have a precarious employment), and they are unable to create their own family. The European youth unemployment rate is more than double that adult rate. More than 7.5 million of young people (they are in the age group between 15 and 24) are not in education system, they haven't a job and they are not seeking one. In some countries, such as Spain or Greece, these unemployment rates are much worse and reach levels above 50% of the young population.This situation has required the creation of many associations, especially those who works with fewer opportunities groups. They has taken responsibility to improve the social environment and quality of life of young people who are faring worse.These new entities have made a effort to fill the gaps of the welfare system, but often these associations are disoriented and they can't alleviate the basic needs of youth in all its areas and also claim for their rights.This it's a job that does not appear in the news or in the media, but is necessary for society to know that there are heroes who implement many initiatives to change and add value to their municipalities. Initiatives managed by young people that sometimes, either through ignorance or lack of experience, are disoriented and do not know well how to manage projects and implement their projects.\"We're super\" is an initiative that seeks to value all that work done by young people and for young people through the creation of a European network to boost and strengthen the community impact of all associations that work in their regions. This project seeks to help them in any way necessary to enable them to have a profound impact on their young beneficiaries.For that reason, \"We're super\" aims to create a high-quality intellectual outcome endorsed and promoted by many local and regional governments: INTEGRAL SYSTEM FOR PROMOTION OF YOUTH ASSOCIATIONISM.This result will include:1. An innovative Web Application that enables economic, social and employment impact calculation of social entities in their region. This program standardize the criteria to measure their impact, obtained from rigorous study by educational and governmental authorities to help the public authorities better assess the return of aid given to the third sector.2. Platform \"We're super\" for the promotion and visibility of the associations and their projects across Europe. This platform will provide ICT and innovative tools that promote transparency and quality management processes and results of social entities.3. European guidelines and multimedia resources for the management of association, implementation of projects and know more about the taxation of youth associations.In addition to this intellectual result, this project will also enhance the visibility and communication of social associations, creating networks of multidisciplinary work and relations between entities, promotional organizations and technical experts promoting new projects of high quality and with greater social impact.For that, the new network will include 6 prestigious European organizations as Fundaci\u00f3 Horta Sud (Spain), Association of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Nova Gradi\u0161ka (Croatia), Asociatia of Culture Tineret if Educatie \"Speranta Ramniceana\" (Romania), AKTO - Human Rights and Democracy (Portugal), Enlights Projects (UK) and Gia Evropaiki Diktio Politotita ke Taftotita (Cyprus). For 18 months they will held three international meetings and will prepare materials with collaboration of local governments, universities and hundreds of associations cooperating in the field of youth, that will ensure the impact, visibility and dissemination of results. It should be noted the support of the Directorate General of Participation of the Generalitat Valenciana and the Generalitat Jove-IVAJ. They will provide a real impact to the project.It is necessary for society to know that there are many initiatives to change and add value to their municipalities. To do that, a large multiplier event will be made at the end of the project. It will serve to publicize the results, but above all to enhance the visibility of all beneficiary organizations and to promote their dialogue with public authorities.In \u201cWe're Super\u201d young people never get down, we know that our dreams are possible, we can improve our society and build the future.
