This work placement will seek to build upon competencies and scaffold new experiences and skills set aligned to participants' professional development. An equal importance will be placed on the social and cultural development of individuals and participants will be offered opportunities through informal and semi-structured activities. An example of activities include working within companies and organizations on a daily basis, for example, a local school or college and delivery sports programmes to various ages and abilities, these also include special need schools and sports clubs. Media students, for example, will work alongside media companies and then undertake field work to capture experiences within film and media production. The emphasis will be on increasing participants' hard skills and soft skills increasing their knowledge in their subject matter, although equal weighting will be applied to social development so that participants are able to self reflect on their experiences, understand and respect cultural difference and increase their confidence levels.\r\nThe project is to be implemented using a robust action plan including key milestones, with preparatory activities forming the platform to deliver a high quality project. A critical recruitment and selection process will be used in order to identify appropriate participants and further preparatory work will ensure that all participants possess the necessary information to comfortably participate in this project.\r\nThe anticipated results include an increase in employability through the Europass accreditation certificate, an increase in collaborative working with the sending and host organisations, a cultural awareness within a European context, a recognition of acquired skill-sets that supports career and job pathways.

There is also a lack of staff who are fluent in any foreign language. In order to improve the quality of school, it is needed to train the staff on new methodologies and on the use of new educational tools.

Promoted at an early age, sport addresses such issues as levels of inactivity and obesity, the need to support and nurture emerging talent, and the formulation of worthwhile goals and performances from an early age. \r\n \r\nThe proposal involves the placement of coaches in the field of football and futsal for a one week period in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe participants will use the mobility to further develop coaching techniques for a multi-sports programme. The one week project is aimed to support the participants to engage in a mobility within a full time professional environment that challenges them both physically and mentally while working in a world class facility, with world class specialists. The opportunity to visit another country broadens the participants' expectations, aspirations, and mobility and is culturally very different to Malta.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of the project is to develop each participant so that they can add to their continual professional development (CPD) and skills base. To accomplish this a programme of training will be planned for the project, designed and developed before the mobility takes place. In short, this proposal will offer the participants not only the best opportunity to meet their career aspirations in top level sport but also in providing an academic backup system for fewer talented staff members. This will enable them to achieve the qualifications or skills required to maintain their involvement in their particular sport. The project will benefit participants in their professional development by giving them the opportunity to experience a mobility in a European country and access opportunity that would not normally be available to them.\r\n\r\nThe Host organisation will assist in the design and implementation of the training schedule. NEW College Pontefract has the appropriate sports infrastructure and supporting resources, which are utilised in an optimum way to provide a rich and positive sports mobility experience backed up from an inclusion perspective. They have expert members of staff that maintain a high standard including the pedagogical side of the project. This development will offer trainees not only the best opportunity to meet their sporting career aspirations, by training in European facilities, but also to provide academic backup system for the less skilled.\r\n\r\nThe training content will consist of a 1 week intensive full-time mobility that will provide and include:\r\n1. Meal Times\r\n2. Sport practices, techniques and methodologies in coaching\r\n3. Sessions covering mental preparation \r\n4. \"Thinking On Your Feet\" Skills and basic creativity and team work, negotiating and working with others\r\n5. Health and safety\r\n6. A cultural and recreational excursion\r\n\r\nThe relevance of the project is related to the Foundation's policy of continued professional development of coaches at all levels. The participant coaches will benefit from a residential environment and will improve both their pedagogical, theoretical and practical understanding of the requirements needed for professional sport coaching and the benefits of combining different sports.

They will use their previous skills and knowledge to work with their host organization's internal programmes, for example, coaching clinics, schools programmes and excellence academies in addition to working on out-reach schemes that involve Malta's Government schemes including the public service 20/20 programme for employees and the Armed Forces Malta physical training programme for their new recruits.\r\nThe students from this West Yorkshire College will undergo a recruitment and selection progress that aims to provider wider opportunities for those students that are considered less advantaged and have a greater distance to travel in terms of personal and social development creating a project with increased and added value in relation to benefit-outcomes. \r\nActivities will include attending schools and colleges, working with all ages and abilities and delivering sports-related programmes to special needs, in addition, the use of sport to engage elements of public services will see both subjects coming together in a unique way to deliver physical training programmes through 'fitness' testing, 'endurance' and strength and stamina particularly focusing on the Armed Forces section. \r\nThe European Credit transfer (ECVET) will be applied so that participants will receive additional accreditation as they work through their placement and also the use of the Europass will support their early career developments.

The intention of this project is to target those that would benefit most from a life-changing mobility experience particularly those considered with fewer opportunities within the Pontefract and sub-district areas. The  vocational aspect of the project mainly focuses on sport which in turn allows for a greater proportion of young people that have entered further education via a lower academic gateway further allowing a considered approach to those that would benefit most from the project.

Equally, the inclusion of Media participants will support their learning by documenting the activities in addition to undertaking a social action activity relating to Luxol Sports Club's community programme.
