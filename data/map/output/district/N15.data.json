Unfortunately, the gap between \u201cwhat is taught\u201d and \u201cwhat is needed in real life\u201d is not closing, not in terms of content nor in delivery of teaching and practiced learning. EU \"Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan\" stresses the importance of practical experiential learning models and experience of real-world entrepreneurs in education; suggesting entrepreneurial learning methodologies into the classroom. \r\n\r\nThe Project is about compiling an open access digital video case library in International Business (IB), aiming towards more attractive education and training in higher education and in VET. This digital platform is structured similar to an IB textbook. However, in this web and video based version, students do not need to read through the chapters of a textbook. Instead, all information is delivered in a video format, each chapter being covered with real life cases. In addition, chapters are explained by top executives instead of academics. Top executives talk about a specific problem that they faced in the IB area and how they solved it. Following these video cases, a questions and answers (Q&A) section is added to the video by academics. The Q&A section is similar to teaching notes in printed case studies or textbooks and can be used as part of class discussion, linking the specific example to the theory in each chapter. \r\n\r\nThe Project partners are: KU Leuven, Belgium; University of Leeds, UK; University of Ljubljana, Slovenia; Poznan University of Economics and Business, Poland and El Izi, UK; KU Leuven being the Applicant Organisation. Each of the four universities are known for their academic excellence and research strengths, covering a wide geography among EU countries. El Izi, UK takes part in the Project as an SME, bringing the technical know-how and prior experience of conducting a similar project in Marketing. The partners have jointly decided to take this Project beyond its present scope, testing, adapting and expanding it according to the needs of the EU. Therefore the Project in line with \u201cEurope Strategy 2020\u201d, involves cooperation and collaboration of partners in the field of Higher Education while introducing an innovative method towards more attractive learning. The Project idea itself is an example of Open Educational Resource (OER), with core values of: Open access, education for all, equality in education and integration of innovative teaching methods with digital technologies - all aligned with the objectives of Erasmus+.\r\n\r\nOne of the main intellectual outputs of the Project will be the development of a new video case collection for IB under MNCs Whiper\u2019g name, both for the academic world and the business, narrated by top executives of well-known companies, by employing innovative teaching methods and using digital technology. Anybody who wants (both youth and adults) to learn IB will be able to benefit from this e-learning digital tool which will allow learners to get free access to it whenever and wherever they wish to log in; irrespective of their socio-economic background, leading to equity and inclusion of education for youth and adults who might otherwise face economic, cultural or geographic obstacles. This supports the idea of flexible learning in line with learners' needs and objectives, as a tool for continuing education programme. More specifically, partners will produce 12 video cases and share with the IB community through its website at www.mncswhispering.com. The Project also addresses the international dimension and multilingualism, as these case videos will be produced in English, Dutch, Polish, and Slovenian; but all will have English dubbing as the lingua franca of IB. In addition, the Project will produce intellectual outputs on IB curriculum and best practices in IB teaching, based on survey results, pilot studies conducted in four universities, classroom applications, participant feedbacks with the joint collaboration of partners.\r\n\r\nThe major impact of the Project will be on IB students and lecturers, who will be exposed to entepreneurial learning with the help of  digitalization. Learning IB through watching videos on real business cases, is expected to prepare students better for the business life. Hence by teaching students relevant knowledge for the labour market, the Project will reinforce cooperation between HEIs and commercial enterprises, leading to a win-win situation for both. In addition, based on the tested successful outcome, this teaching method could be adapted to other areas of Social Sciences, such as Economics, Finance, Organisational Behaviour as well as being adopted by other EU countries and beyond; having a much wider and longer impact than the initial scope of the Project.", "http://www.elizi.net", null, "erasmus_2018-1-BE02-KA203-046832_2"]]}}, "3SD": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2018, "Outdoor Learning, Forest Schools and Leadership", "Woodlands Park Nursery School and Children's Centre", 20599.0, 1, 1, "Woodlands Nursery School and Children\u2019s Centre is  based in South Tottenham at the heart of a diverse and vibrant community where we provide outstanding early education, childcare, information and support for our local families.

On the one hand for a teaching assignment of one of our arts teachers at our partner organisation in Palermo, Italy. In cooperation with the local staff, she wants to offer a creative workshop for children and teenagers entitled \"Imagining Ideal Living\". This workshop might hopefully initiate a strategic partnership in the long run. On the other hand we apply for a staff training mobility for one of our foreign language teachers and project co-coordinators in form of a job shadowing/observation period at our partner schools in England. The main objective here is to gain a deeper insight into the British educational system. This seems vital to us with regard to a professionalisation in giving advise and support to our interns at English partner institutions and to modulate and match our joint vocational training programme for the students' \"year of acknowledgement\". We plan to present the outcome of these experiences at our school/ on our homepage etc. and hope to motivate and encourage other staff members to benefit from a mobility abroad. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides intensifying and consolidating our contacts to already existing partner institutions for long term mobilities, one of our objectives for 2014 is to enlarge the possibilities for short term mobilities for our educators and educational therapists in order to encourage them more easily to go abroad, develop their professional skills and intercultural competences and widen their horizons. Altogether we would like to offer 7 short term mobilities for educational therapists at institutions in Austria and 7 short term mobilities for educators at institutions in Austria and Denmark. 14 long term mobilities we would like to offer to educators and educational therapists at institutions in Italy, Turkey, Austria and England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared, however, that we might not be successful in achieving our last objective as requested, because the new Erasmus+ grant support for long term mobilities for German students has been cut considerably (around 30 % compare to the former Leonardo grant support). The consequence of this is that the students in their \"year of acknowledgement\", especially those who do their work placements at communal schools in England, would need to be economically priviledged and be able to finance their mobility abroad from own resources.

Both multi cultural  parts of the city with many social and economical problems. Both facing a large number of youth not participating, neither in jobs nor in other activities.\r\n\r\nLarge scale programs were implemented already, as youth employment is one of the priorities of the municipalities in both cities. However, the effect is not really strong. Programs run for years already, but do not really influence the figures on unemployment. Basically that figure is quite steady for years already.\r\n\r\nMain objective of this project is by means of  research and several case studies to develop a new, sustainable method in soft skill learning with the aim of contribute structurally to the employability of deprived youth. We want to have a structural impact on the chances of vulnerable young people on the labor market.\r\n\r\nWe notice that many employment programs focus on acquiring hard skills.

The experience of all involved partners learns us that working with soft skill learning has a positive effect. With this project we want to encourage youth to acquire a set of soft skills like self esteem, communication skills, self reflection and collaboration skills. We intend to use creative tools to develop these soft skills amongst youth. In the description of the Intellectual Outputs we explain how the different creative methods should add to the development of young people. The final result should be that they will get employment easier, or become self employed. We set ourself goals in how many participants of the activities within this project should be employed or self-employed within a reasonable timeframe (I.e. Three months) after joining one of the activities.\r\n\r\nWe like to start this strategic partnership in order to explore the opportunities and power of creative methods and tools in this soft skill learning.

Another important effect is the positive experience with a geographical mobility and the resulting access to wider European educational and vocational training sections.The objectives and concepts are prepared, coached and evaluated in a continuous co-operation between Erzbisch\u00f6fliches Berufskolleg and the partner institutions.Target Group:Our target groups are students to be trained towards becoming state recognized educators and health practitioners.  The studies and work are divided in the fields of child and youth care as well as remedial education care. At the time of their vocational training period, the students are in their second year at the department of professional training college, respectively in their 3rd year at the department of the professional grammar school/academic upper-secondary education (double qualification as an educator with high school diploma).Activities:Over the next two years, 80 students, depending on program regulations, will have the opportunity to complete a 4-, 6-, or 8-week internship in another European country. Our partner institutions are based in Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Malta, Poland, Turkey and the United Kingdom.Project preparation, implementation and follow-up:The EU-Internship is an integral part of the training. The preparation develops during the complete school year (every second week, two Saturday workshops, one weekend workshop in a youth hostel - focused on adventure/outdoor pursuits) and contains the presentation and information about the EU- program lead by the responsible teachers of the EU-Team. Information about the different countries and their educational system is given by the students. Sensitizing cross-cultural understanding will be instilled through experiential learning exercises and dealing with social and cultural issues and values, thus creating a foundation for the subsequent EU internship.Possible outcomes:- Competency increase based on the EU-project team and the subsequent EU-internship and professional development- The continuous monitoring of the students during their EU-internship contributes to a better knowledge of different education systems.  - An increase of discussions internally and outside of school, as well as in Education conferences and in partnering education institutions is to be expected.- The topic of Europe will also have a greater emphasis in the school curriculum and will also attract more students of the vocational colleges.There are various benefits of the Europe Mobility. The students gain professional competencies and by enlarging the awareness of different qualities of different nations become open-minded which then enables them to find jobs abroad. The teachers of our school are involved in networking as they visit our students in their institutions. Thus they gain experience and strengthen their competencies for their own work. The public image of the college attracts possible applicants who understand the European idea. Workshops and an annual meeting with our European partners at our college unite students, teachers and foreign colleagues.", "http://www.trianglenursery.org", null, "erasmus_2016-1-DE02-KA102-003117_10"], [2014, "Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsbildung durch Sensibilisierung f\u00fcr Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede in der EU-Bildung", "Triangle Children's Centre", 87532.0, 8, 13, "Target group and training objectives\r\nOur target group are students being trained to be state registered educators.
