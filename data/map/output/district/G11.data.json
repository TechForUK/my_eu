Historically, anti-doping efforts have focused on the detection and deterrence of doping in  competitive sport.  However, there is a growing concern that doping is occurring outside the organised sporting system; giving rise to the belief that the misuse of doping agents in recreational sport has become a societal problem and a public health issue that must be addressed.The main objectives of the Project ANTIDOPING GREEN SEAL are to define a consistent and agreed understanding of which doping substances are used in the context of recreational sport,establish an evidence-based asse ssment of the problem and  and develop the comprehensive preventive programme to conduct a raising-awareness campaign in six EU countries (Spain, Poland, Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy and Croatia).In order to meet the project aims, the Ethical Code regarding doping in recreational sports will be developed, which will be supported, but not made obligatory by the participating organisation in their environments and to provide the Green Seal to all recreational sports settings and centres committed to following the rules and standards established in the Ethical Code. Also, the project will be aimed at raising awareness campaigns of the problem of doping among youngsters in the recreational environments, the harmful effects of doping and the advantages that provide practicing recreational sports.The project will contribute to the development of information and campaigns and other preventive measures regarding doping in recreational sport and related issues that could be apllied by sports movements,fitness sector,education system and health sector.
