We will -refresh our language teaching methodology, -look for new ideas and resources-discover how languages are taught in Spain and France-reassess the way we all teach languages and -apply new techniques and methods to our teaching. Our project will involve 14 members of staff each making two visits to either Spain or France (12 mobilities in total to France and 16 in total to Spain) over a two year period. One person will take on the role of project manager and ensure clarity about individual and project objectives and day to day monitoring and running of the project. The project will be overseen by the senior management team and board of governors and be held accountable to pupils and parents.The impact of the project will be felt across all departments in our school and to be visible in every aspect of our school life. It will spread beyond our school to other schools in our area and have a positive effect on parents and the local community.We will use the project to improve the attainment of pupils including those who find learning languages difficult, re-engaging reluctant learners and making languages a subject our children enjoy and want to continue. The development of a strong, whole school link between our school and the French/Spanish schools will lead to activities to engage all our learners, including our reluctant learners, children with low basic skills and learning difficulties, building their self-esteem.We will extend professional networks with our partner and cluster primary schools, produce high quality materials and resources to share with other schools in our cluster, and develop ways to involve parents and the community more in the life of our school through cultural events. Participation in these courses across two years will mean that we will develop a large network of professional colleagues from different teaching backgrounds and also from our link schools in Spain and France. We intend that the strong links we will build through the proposed structure of these courses will lead to excellent relationships between ourselves and our Spanish and French colleagues, giving us a strong basis to be able to successfully plan pupil exchanges.", "http://www.seaford.org", "The Johnson Trust Ltd.
