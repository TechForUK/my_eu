Vegetation traits will be linked to potential ES provision, case studies will measure actual ES levels and inform models which will show unused opportunities and trade-offs among ES by SNH from habitat to landscape scale. This will be achieved for a range of representative cropping systems and farming intensities in regions dominated by agriculture and matched to the requirements of local and national stakeholders. Surveys will identify key SNH and existing literature will be used to link their vegetation traits to ES provision. ES provision will be measured in existing habitat types (SNH to crop) across economically important cropping systems, farming intensities and four European agro-climatic zones using simple techniques in 16 case studies. A case study is defined by a unique combination of region, crop species, and service. Each case study will concentrate on locally important cropping system and the main ES required. Pollination and pest control have been identified as main ES needed, but also soil fertility, weed control and social services will be considered. The relative socio-economic weight of the studied ecosystem services will be appraised using feedback from national experts using a semi-quantitative method. Data will parameterise spatially explicit models to determine how the vegetation composition, management, shape, area, and placement of SNH in agricultural landscapes affect the distribution of mobile-agent based ecosystem services from farm to landscape level. To investigate synergies and trade-offs in ecological services, multi-criteria analysis will be developed to combine a suite of modules in an integrative modelling framework. Outputs are designed to inform local, national and EU stakeholders on how to improve ES provision from SNH and will include a novel web-based tool.", 340383.0, 3057002.0, 9, 14, "QUESSA", "http://www.quessa.eu/", "http://www.gct.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015-09/163176.jpg", "fp7_105334_996892281"], [1456790400000, 1614470400000, "Soil Care for profitable and sustainable crop production in Europe", "Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust", "European crop production is to remain competitive while reducing environmental impacts, requiring development and uptake of effective soil improving cropping systems. The overall aim of SOILCARE is to identify and evaluate promising soil-improving cropping systems and agronomic techniques increasing profitability and sustainability across scales in Europe. A trans-disciplinary approach will be used to evaluate benefits and drawbacks of a new generation of soil improving cropping systems, incorporating all relevant bio-physical, socio-economic and political aspects. Existing information from literature and long term experiments will be analysed to develop a comprehensive methodology for assessing performance of cropping systems at multiple levels. A multi-actor approach will be used to select promising soil-improving cropping systems for scientific evaluation in 16 study sites across Europe covering different pedo-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Implemented cropping systems will be monitored with stakeholder involvement, and will be assessed jointly with scientists. Specific attention will be paid to adoption of soil-improving cropping systems and agronomic techniques within and beyond the study sites. Results from study sites will be up-scaled to the European level to draw general lessons about applicability potentials of soil-improving cropping systems and related profitability and sustainability impacts, including assessing barriers for adoption at that scale. An interactive tool will be developed for end-users to identify and prioritize suitable soil-improving cropping systems anywhere in Europe. Current policies and incentives will be assessed and targeted policy recommendations will be provided. SOILCARE will take an active dissemination approach to achieve impact from local to European level, addressing multiple audiences, to enhance crop production in Europe to remain competitive and sustainable through dedicated soil care.", 212228.0, 6592195.0, 18, 28, "SOILCARE", null, "http://www.gct.org.uk", null, "h2020_200533_996892281"], [1388534400000, 1514678400000, "VALorising European Research for Innovation in agriculturE and forestry", "Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust", "Many EU and nationally funded research projects in the fields of agriculture and forestry provide excellent results, but the outreach and translation of these results into field practices is limited. The overall aim of VALERIE is to boost the outreach of research by facilitating the integration into innovative field practices. The work in VALERIE consists of three major approaches. (1). Stakeholder-driven approach. Ten case studies set the central stage for the bottom-up approach of the project, aided by highly effective tools of web semantics and ontology. Cases are centred around a specific supply-chain, a farming sector or a landscape. The stakeholder communities (SHC) represent the natural networks engaged in innovation. They drive the process of articulating innovation needs, enabling the retrieval of precisely matching knowledge and solutions, and evaluating their potential in the local context. (2) Theme-driven approach. VALERIE retains six thematic domains that are at the heart of sustainable production and resource use. These six provide the back-bone for structuring the annotation and summarising activities, which in turn will provide a vast body of knowledge accessible via the Communication Facility (CF). (3) Knowledge disclosure. VALERIE will launch a \u2018Communication Facility\u2019 (CF) for the EIP-Networking Facility. The CF supports communication amongst actors in the field and researchers. Next, it injects new knowledge into the innovation process, by enabling users to retrieve highly relevant (tailored-to-needs) information, based on their own vocabularies. In offering tools for communication, as well as content structured for efficient knowledge retrieval, the CF fuses the advantages typical of \u2018learning networks\u2019 and \u2018linear\u2019 modes of knowledge sharing. The CF will be set up, tested and integrated into the EIP-NF platform, as a generic infrastructure for use by \u2018fresh\u2019 stakeholder communities, also beyond the life of the VALERIE project.", 121959.0, 3074483.0, 7, 16, "VALERIE", null, "http://www.gct.org.uk", null, "fp7_111331_996892281"]]}}, "3HW": {"cordis": {"data": [[1349049600000, 1446249600000, "Aerial Base Stations with Opportunistic Links for Unexpected & Temporary Events", "Allsopp Helikites Limited", "Recent history has shown that in the aftermath of an emergency, disaster or related unexpected events, telecommunication infrastructures play a key role in recovery operations. In most cases, the legacy terrestrial infrastructure is seriously compromised and cannot guarantee reliable services for citizens and rescue teams. It is also well accepted that current public safety networks cannot provide sufficient capacity for broadband applications.The main goal of ABSOLUTE is to design and validate a holistic and rapidly deployable mobile network to provide broadband services based on a flexible, scalable, resilient and secure network design.The most important elements that ABSOLUTE will pioneer are i) LTE-A base station embedded in Low Altitude Platform enabling a large coverage for broadband services ii) Portable land mobile base stations interoperable with conventional public safety networks, iii) Advanced multi-service professional terminals for first responders. The usage of satellite communications for both broadband backhauling as well as narrowband ubiquitous messaging services is another essential enabler.ABSOLUTE objectives will be achieved by developing innovative concepts out of promising ideas, namely cognitive mechanisms for dynamic spectrum management enabling a seamless network reconfiguration as well as opportunistic and cooperative networking mechanisms ensuring maximum system availability and dependability. Proof of concept implementations and realistic demonstrations are also envisaged.Thus ABSOLUTE will greatly impact the next generation public safety communication systems in Europe, enabling operators, manufacturers and other relevant stakeholders to exploit new market opportunities for LTE-A and satellite communications.
