Current practice with mobile technologies tends to replicate existing pedagogical practice and many valuable opportunities especially to engage learners from diverse and marginalized backgrounds are wasted. However where mobile technologies are used in a transformative way there is compelling evidence of greater engagement from learners, more social inclusion, motivation and community involvement effectively transcending many of the boundaries and limitations of traditional schools and education. Therefore this project advocates an innovative, developmental approach to widen the spread and reach of these isolated examples.\r\nAims/objectives:\r\nSince no single group of stakeholders is likely to be effective in tackling the problem described above, this project will develop a cross-sectoral and transnational partnership to challenge existing attitudes and practices. This involves teacher educators in universities working with the next generation of teachers, teachers and leaders in schools, and policy makers who can legislate for sustainable change at scale. The project aims to demonstrate how the professional profile of educators across this spectrum can be strengthened to ensure that learning is responsive to the benefits and opportunities afforded by mobile technologies. It seeks to define what transformational learning with mobile technologies looks like and to help stakeholders design and evaluate transformative mobile learning episodes using a bespoke mobile app which will be developed iteratively over three design cycles.\r\nAdditionally the app will support users in evaluating the impact of these transformational lessons, enabling  teachers and their school leaders to make more informed judgments about how they invest and deploy these technologies in future. The project will involve decision and policy makers from an early start and thereafter, since one of the objectives is to ensure these key stakeholders are better informed and able to make judgments based on reliable evidence rather than on anecdote. \r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\nPrimary participants will be drawn from the 6 institutions of teacher education in this project, including approx.  50 teacher educators and 1000 pre-service teachers. They will work with a network of 24 schools (4 per partner) who have been recruited as committed and highly motivated associate partners in this bid. This group will include over 200 teachers and approximately 1500 students. Two school leaders from each of the 24 partner schools will also take part as will policy makers in each partner country.\r\nDescription of activities:\r\nThe primary activity will be the creation of a multi-purpose mobile app (IO2) that will support educators and pre-service teachers in designing and evaluating creative and innovative learning episodes for their students. The project team will use a Design Based Research methodology to design and construct the app over three iterative cycles that will involve extensive consultation with experts in the field of mobile learning (see IO1 - Scoping Report) before it is field tested in the 24 partner schools and at the multiplier and LTTE events that are planned, leading to the creation of 24 multimedia case studies (IO3). An online MOOC (IO4) and various academic papers (IO5) will be developed to disseminate the outputs and findings from the project with a wider audience, focusing especially on decision and policy makers in each country. \r\nResults and impact\r\nThere will be greater clarity about what constitutes transformative learning with mobile technologies, distilled as a series of design principles (IO1). This will be used as a benchmark to enable school leaders and policy makers to make informed judgments about the impact and value of these technologies on learning.  It will also be used to inform the design and construction of the mobile app (IO2) ensuring participants are more capable in using these technologies to effect genuine educational change which can be measured by the extent they are able to design learning experiences that would otherwise by impossible and inconceivable. Crucially the project will impact on decision makers by providing them with more reliable evidence and guidance upon which to base educational policy.

This is particularly noticeable in Teacher Education  which straddles both the Higher Education and school sectors, helping to prepare new teachers, and in turn students, for the challenges of the 21st century.  What little research exists suggests teacher educators and lecturers, are ill-prepared to grasp the opportunities which  mobile phones and the tablet computers offer, and are unaware of the pedagogical transformations which might be  achieved if they are harnessed effectively.  Emerging research   undertaken by members of this project team show that teacher educators and other academics are interested and excited about the opportunities to embrace mobile technologies in their teaching but are also  ignorant about what constitutes good practice in this field or how to go about implementing such pedagogies at both an individual and institutional level. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis cross-sectoral project  addresses these  needs and in so doing it meets a number of key European priorities  identified by all of the project partners including those of 'modernising practices (in this case pedagogies) in Higher Education, revising and strengthening the professional profile of the teaching profession, and utilising ICT as a vehicle to support and transform learning.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to leverage such changes without a cross-sectoral partnership which brings together academics, teacher educators and school teachers working across boundaries around this common theme of developing 21st century pedagogies. This partnership consists of three European universities which specialise in preparing and training new teachers (Hull, Bergen and Karlsruhe) along with two other universities who have been included because of their specific skills and expertise in the design and construction of multimedia artefacts for mobile learning (Stuttgart) and the design and theoretical modelling of mobile learning scenarios in teacher education (UTS, Australia). Three secondary schools complete the partnership (Hull; Bergen and Karlsruhe) and these have been selected because of their existing involevment and support for European intercultural actitivities, their expertise in using technology, and their direct involvement in the preparation of trainee teachers. Together the partnership offers a complementary blend of expertise skill sets to achieved the overall ambitions of the project and to establish the basis of an ongoing European/International m-learning network.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo achieve these ambitions project partners will adopt a  Design Based Research (DBR) which will work with partners to iteratively construct four outcomes which include a mobile learning toolkit to support educators in evaluating and implementing mobile learning pedagogies; a set of e-Books across a range of curriculum areas to exemplify how teachers and students can use mobile technologies to co-author original materials; an online training course in iTunesU to support educators in using mobile technologies, and a set of academic publications to validate and further disseminate the outcomes of this project to a wider audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of this project teacher educators and teachers will have a greater understanding and ability to incorporate the use of mobile technologies into their practice in ways which brings about significant pedagogical change.

Particular anxieties exist about the social disengagement of those with differing cultural, social and religious backgrounds and the difficulties in addressing this through education by traditional means. These concerns have been heightened by international terrorism and high-profile extremist events.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background young people from communities with different  religious or cultural identities can find it difficult to identify, engage with or be welcomed into an inclusive sense of citizenship in their host society and may not acquire a sense of inclusive citizenship which embraces Europe comfortably. The need for a contemporary and more inclusive conception of European citizenship and a wider participatory democracy has been increasingly noted both in EU policy and more widely.\r\n\r\nHowever the desire to develop a stronger, more cohesive sense of European and national citizenship by implementing Citizenship Education in schools has met with limited success. The intentions for citizenship education are sometimes contested and misunderstood, its delivery may make little reference to significant local and national issues and how politicians, the media and the wider society deal with these and in many schools, colleges and universities the general provision for citizenship education is inadequate. Teachers often find the topic problematic to teach, due to poor knowledge, inadequate training or resources and pedagogy that do not strongly engage young people. \r\n\r\nThere is growing recognition that European citizenship education needs to be more about engaging and empowering individuals and less about the study of academic content, citizenship duties, the institutions of government, or citizenship as social compliance and contribution. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to develop educational practices and innovative digital resources to allow young people in secondary, further and higher education to explore, develop and practice citizenship in a safe environment representing real-world contexts that deal with issues of direct relevance to them, their lives and their growth as European citizens in a pluralistic democracy. It will achieve this by using new and emerging digital technologies (including virtual reality) that are popular with and attractive to young people and motivate them to participate and therefore sustain their involvement. Research has shown that the imaginative use of ICT can, if used  appropriately, change long-held and culturally deep-rooted views and that the use of immersive virtual environments is effective in developing self-perception and a renewed sense of identity.\r\n\r\nExperts in citizenship, digital technology and educational pedagogy from nine educational institutions including primary and secondary schools, colleges, universities and organisations involved in training and teacher education from across Europe work together in this project, together with their students, to create a toolkit of innovative digital resources and a library of guidelines, manuals and training packages for educators. These will provide teachers, lecturers and trainers with the skills and resources to better engage their students to develop a stronger sense of European citizenship and understand and embrace the shared values underpinning modern democratic societies.\r\n\r\nThe resources will also include scenarios, responses and reflections on these by young people and because of their authenticity these will enhance their impact on citizenship education and create high credibility for the project outcomes. The resources will be extensively tested and widely distributed and enable educators to acquire the necessary skills to develop further resources using the training and guidelines the project will provide.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project will be to enhance the skills, knowledge and resources of educators to help them teach European citizenship in a more effective and engaging way that will motivate and inspire them and their students to create a deeper sense of European citizenship that identifies and embraces common democratic values to promote social inclusion and harmony. The project will also increase the acquisition of the digital skills, literacies and competencies of educators and students that are essential for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe potential longer term benefits of the project will be to: identify what motivates young people and individuals with differing cultural, religious, political and social backgrounds and heritages to engage with citizenship education; promote greater engagement with public and political life; encourage informed debate to facilitate a deeper understanding of the concerns and values of other social, cultural and ethic groups; promote greater social inclusion, harmony and individual well being; and enhance the digital skills and competencies of citizens.", "http://www.hull.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA201-036710_coordinator"], [2016, "Anti-Doping Values in Coach Education (ADVICE)", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", 316618.0, 7, 8, "The use of performance enhancing drugs represents a threat to European sport, because doping undermines the key principles of open and fair competition.

This will be achieved by developing an evidence-based mobile application for coaches. The project focuses on coaches who coach athletes aged between 14 and 21 years, because attitudes towards performance enhancing drugs are formed during this period.

The issue originates in schools when many girls make critical subject choices that will effectively lock them out from STEM in higher education and employment. This is coupled with the pervasive cultural stereotype of the male scientist or engineer and entrenched parochial attitudes. The gender in-balance in STEM subjects and in employment statistics are transnational concerns which extend to most EU countries, yet these themes do not feature prominently in teacher training while initiatives and resources launched by subject associations, education providers and others often tend to feature a \u2018top-down\u2019 approach.This project aims to increase the employment potential of all young Europeans, but especially girls, by improving their interest and engagement in STEM subjects through linking these to a wider awareness of global issues. Our partnership organisations have evidence through their existing work that bringing together STEM and global education often with an additional local dimension results in added motivation for girls and a sustained interest in these key subjects.  By working initially with carefully selected pilot schools we will avoid the shortcomings of the \u2018top-down\u2019 approach. In addition, practical solutions to some of global challenges and problems on which the target groups will work are best developed internationally if they are to have wider credibility. The project will facilitate much of this work through the development of digital skills and especially through the collaborative authoring of eBooks. This aspect capitalises on existing partner expertise. It enables dissemination to new and developing networks exploring this pedagogy, but most importantly brings with it an inclusive element as young people incorporate their virtually ubiquitous access to mobile technologies into their learning. Our partnership of nine institutions brings together NGOs, universities and secondary schools. Each will contribute their experience of international partnerships, global education, previous STEM activities and cutting edge research into mobile learning to the project, but they also have in common their capacity to innovate and to work collaboratively. Although the partnership has been specially created for this project all the partners have previously worked with at least one other member of the team. The planned activities will initially focus on the work of the universities, NGOs and pilot schools to develop and test a series of bespoke Global STEM Challenges aimed at engaging all pupils, but especially girls, in creating practical solutions to real world global issues. With support from their national partner organisation schools will collect, adapt and produce materials which they feel will support other pupils to take part in a focused STEM challenge. They will trial these with younger (or other) pupils in their own school and in their partner school. A further part of the brief will be for pupils to interview female researchers working on global issues in different countries and to incorporate these video clips in their materials.  These outputs will form the nucleus of an online Teacher Toolkit. The pilot schools will also start the process of constructing and testing in-service and pre-service training materials that would help to convince teachers and teacher trainers to adopt these methodologies. The training activities will populate an online Teacher Education Programme to be demonstrated to early adopters through a series of local dissemination sessions and Multiplier Events. All of these activities will be rigorously benchmarked, monitored and evaluated, including pupil evaluations, so providing the partnership with credible data and enabling them to work together on a series of academic papers and presentations, an essential part of the dissemination process.

Moreover, weaving collaboration through web enabled communication technologies into the teaching of such competencies, enables deep learning (Fullan et al., 2014). However, it is also true that schools find the integration of ISTC into their curricula, problematic.

The second is the similar development of an ISTC Course, including the creation of interactive materials, activities, examples and assignments which will be put together in a series of Student eBooks, each related to different grade bands in the ISTC framework and will help students to progress to increasingly higher levels of understanding. The third activity is associated with the design and creation of a Teacher\u2019s Toolkit, which will exemplify and illustrate best practice in using the ISTC Inventory and ISTC Course through a freely available bespoke digital resource toolkit for secondary school teachers. The toolkit will include a suite of tools (an online community of practice, dedicated YouTube channel and an eBook) which will collate the few pre-existing case studies and develop new case studies, exemplars, rubrics, templates, etc. that can be continually updated after the project end. The last activity is dissemination through presentations, publicity, events and new and evolving networks.\r\n\r\nThis project uses a collaborative constructivist approach (Garrison and Archer, 2000) underpinned by a transactional model and builds on the \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach used in the iverge project at the University of Hull and the learner-led approach used at Sophianum, enabling teachers to become facilitators and guides in the learning process as students engage in \u2018deep learning\u2019 (Fullan et al., 2014). Teachers involved in the project will acquire a greater understanding about the potential learning gains associated with both the transactional learning model and the innovative use of emerging technologies (i.e. eBooks, Immersive Technologies) and they will possess a greater capability and competence to use these effectively. Students from the partner organizations will be more employable and better prepared for working in the 21st century with a greater array of skill sets, gained through learning with digital tools across geographical borders. Participants involved directly in the project will have a more positive European and international outlook.\r\n\r\nThe impact on participants, their organisations and the 'early adopters' will be considerable both during and after the project, as we have built in a cascade model of dissemination. The ISTC Inventory, Student eBooks and Teachers Toolkit will be available over several platforms and maintained beyond the end of the EU funding. They will be self-explanatory and can be used by institutions without further support or guidance from the project partners since guidance materials will be incorporated. The project also aims to establish the basis of a European wide network of ISTC teachers, and this network will also be used to support activity after the EU funding is completed.", "http://www.hull.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA201-013548_coordinator"], [2016, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", 247032.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.hull.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA103-023190_coordinator"], [2015, "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", 226739.0, 1, 1, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.hull.ac.uk", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA103-012574_coordinator"], [2016, "Redesigning educational curricula and digitally-afforded collaborations to promote multimodal learning experiences", "UNIVERSITY OF HULL", 185498.0, 6, 6, "In \u201cThe digital world in 2030: what place for Europe,\u201d the European Internet Foundation: Political Leadership for Network Society, and the European e-Competence Framework, which is a component of the European Union\u2019s strategy for the development of e-Skills in the 21st century, there is an explicit call to educators to address through their curricula the growing imperative for the development of e-skills. It is estimated that 90% of all jobs across different sectors will require some form of high tech skills. However, the \u201cdigital capability gap\u201d in Europe has become \u201ca problem of epic proportions because technology literacy, capability and skills are critical for all industries\u201d (\u201ce-Skills Manifesto,\u201d 2012). The EU has set the development of digital skills as one of its seven top priorities (Digital Single Market, 2016). Even though college students use technology on a daily basis for social networking, gaming, and multiple other personal purposes, they are not given equal opportunities to use digital tools for learning, digital collaboration, and transnational exchanges across academic institutions and geographic locations (Arnold & Ducate, 2011). Further, models of traditionally delivered lectures are still promoted, restricted to the institutional boundaries and requirements. Consequently, curricula need to be redesigned to promote digital collaborations, e-skill development, immersive, and personalized learning that expand beyond the institutional boundaries. Students and instructors across Europe need to be exposed to the curricula of other academic institutions, identify common grounds for transnational collaborations, digital skills development, task-oriented activities, an collaborate with students and faculty members from other cultures and linguistic backgrounds.In this context, a pool of highly experienced educators, researchers, and professionals in technology enhanced lifelong learning in diverse disciplines will collaborate to redesign curricula around digitally participatory learning and transnational collaborations afforded by a digital platform and other Web 2.0 tools and applications. The aim of this consortium is first to design an interactive digital platform based on faculty members\u2019 and students\u2019 needs, and learning objectives. Second, to set a common agenda through redesigned curricula to promote collaborations, expand learning opportunities, community building, and guide students in using various digital tools to be immersed in multimodal learning experiences that cannot be experienced in any other context. The consortium members in each discipline (Electrical Engineering and ESL/EFL teacher education) will identify common grounds in the curricula, share lectures, design and integrate digitally-afforded collaborative learning activities that will promote transnational collaborations. Third, the project will draw on recent endeavors among educators to promote multimodal learning experiences to improve student engagement using multiple modes of context representation (i.e., interactive e-contexts) and cater to the learning styles of a diverse student population across Europe (Sankey, Birch, & Gardiner, 2010). It will expand this framework by including transnational collaborations in a new paradigm where institutions, faculty members, and students will be able to collaborate closely to experience more interactive, and collaborative learning experiences that expand beyond the institutional and geographic boundaries. The impact of these digitally-enabled collaborations will be determined by: (a) the development of, training on, and successful integration of the digital platform; (b) instructors\u2019 evaluation of the platform; (c) instructors\u2019 evaluation of the processes and products involved in transforming students\u2019 learning; and (d) evaluation of students\u2019 learning experiences, including their level of motivation, group decision making, team work, information exchange, and knowledge building. Various instruments will be used to evaluate both students learning processes and learning outcomes (Macdonald, 2003), as well as instructors\u2019 experiences (e.g., instructor and student questionnaires). The project will generate insightful findings on the impact of such multimodal collaborative learning experiences and redesigned curricula to promote digital collaborations and e-Skill development on: (a) the students\u2019 learning and level of motivation; (b) instructors\u2019 teaching practices and efforts to meet the student needs; (c) the benefits of transnational collaborations among academic institutions, students, and faculty; (d) students\u2019 building of competencies, skills, and knowledge. The impact of redesigned curricula and digitally-enabled collaborations among academic institutions will be used to identify opportunities to expand further this initiative in other areas and through the use of more extensive digital platforms and tools in various disciplines and transnational training activities.", "http://www.hull.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-CY01-KA203-017327_3"], [2017, "ERASMUS+ KOMPETENS - Internationell kompetensutveckling p\u00e5 Anderstorpsgymnasiet", "Global Learning Association", 74405.0, 7, 9, "The Erasmus+ KA1 School Mobility Project ERASMUS + KOMPETENS - boosting staff at Anderstorpsgymnasiet through international courses and conferences - is a skills development project for headmasters and staff at Anderstorpsgymnasiet, an upper secondary school in the Municipality of Skellefte\u00e5, north Sweden.

The objective of this program is the development of our staff's professional competency in the subjects of pedagogy and didactics and thus, the improved quality of the services that our organization provides. Specific goals include the acquisition of knowledge on the use of tablets in the classroom and especially in teaching English as a foreign language and science related subjects. \"DELASALLE\" wishes to embed the use of tablets in the teaching process because it considers that these tools are very user friendly to teachers and students. Furthermore, other goals are, the use of innovative teaching techniques, such as inquiry based and cooperative learning; and the ability to produce digital educational material and to handle a Learning Management System (LMS). Finally, the primary goal is to establish a school culture among the teachers that emphasizes continuous learning, cooperation with fellow schools, and participation in European educational events.\r\nOne of the activities that already been planned is the training of 9 members of faculty  in different parts of Europe made by  acclaimed organizations in the field of teacher training, given that these specific skills and competencies are not been provided by a Greek training institution.
