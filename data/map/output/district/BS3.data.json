In this proposal we look at short supply chains from the perspective of urban rather than rural development. Short supply chains can play a role in addressing urban problems such as climate change, obesity, storm water control, etc.\nShort food supply chains have been advocated as a means to reduce CO2 impact of the agricultural system. Although a reduction of food miles certainly contributes to reducing climate impact, this proposal takes as premise that to really improve the ecological performance of the food system other flows of goods and services need to be shortened as well (e.g. nutrient, water, and carbon cycles need to be closed). In the current context these aspects are usually treated separately, this proposal argues to treat them more integrated.\nThe research will analyse the way in which several European city regions deal with short supply chains in food, nutrients, water, and carbon. The project will facilitate selected SMEs to further innovate in food production and delivery, nutrient and water management, and multifunctional use of space, and will disseminate the results among a wider audience of SMEs. By doing so, the research will look beyond the state of the art, it will suggest how city regions could look like if they chose to further relocalise their food system.\nFinally the project will also establish links with stakeholders and RTD activities regarding urban and peri-urban agriculture and short chain delivery of food in urban and peri-urban areas in developing countries. This will be organised through a process of dialogue, sharing of experiences, exchanging of best practices and joint learning.", 31710.0, 1489081.0, "SUPURBFOOD", "Planning future food production", "A multidisciplinary network is being established to improve sustainable urban food planning and support the invention and implementation of relevant strategies.", "Improving food supply chains in urban areas can help address numerous urban challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving food quality and safety. Improving supply chains though, and ensuring their sustainability, requires not only shortening them, but shortening the flow of other goods and services as well.\n\nBy addressing chain shortness, water, nutrient and waste management, and multifunctional land use, the project 'Towards sustainable modes of urban and peri-urban food provisioning' (http://www.supurbfood.eu (SUPURBFOOD)) takes a more comprehensive approach to sustainable urban food production. The project is developing innovative approaches to these aspects in Europe and the global south, analysing the way different city regions deal with such issues.\n\nThe first 18 months of the project, the exploration phase, have now been completed and the second experimentation phase has begun. During the exploration phase, data was collected and analysed from different European city regions on each of the three topics. The team discovered that citizens are drivers for making food a local political issue and that support at the regional level would increase its impact. Clear interest was shown in short food supply chains for both production and consumption.\n\nIn terms of waste management, a lot of technological solutions were used and there was little civic participation. The experiences and best practices of developing countries were also studied in this first phase. It became clear that shortening chains requires the strengthening of linkages at the city region level and initiatives based on a balanced mix of government mechanisms. In general, this first phase provided interesting approaches at the thematic level and helped prioritise the needs of participating small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nThis project is a valuable opportunity for science and industry stakeholders to collaborate and exploit new research opportunities to address pressing urban challenges. Collaboration will continue through two city region workshops in all seven city regions and two international seminars. Ultimately, the project will provide policy recommendations for both public policy and business strategies, promoting innovative interdisciplinary solutions for sustainable urban food production.", "http://www.supurbfood.eu/", "http://www.localfood.org.uk", "/docs/results/images/2015/156383.jpg", "fp7_105008_953926325"], ["5BX", "European regions fostering innovation for sustainable production and efficient use of woody biomass", "Crops for Energy Limited", "The ROKWOOD project will support the cooperation between six European research-driven clusters in order to improve research and technological development (RTD), market uptake and to increase investments in wooden biomass production and utilisation schemes at regional level.

Apart from these partners the European Biomass Industry Association (EUBIA) has joint the consortium in order to assure a broad dissemination of project results to a broad range of stakeholders (e.g. industry, biomass producer, research organisations). All partners have been actively involved in the development, implementation, monitoring and utilisation of short rotation plantations (SRPs) for the regional production of wooden biomass. Taking into account the knowledge and experience of the partners the project has the capacity to become one main driver of innovation in the wooden biomass sector in Europe.

In order to cover the growing demand for biomass raw materials as energy carriers, what are known as Short Rotation Coppices (SRCs), where fast-growing trees are cultivated within short rotation periods, are increasingly popular. The potential recognition of SRCs as what is referred to as \u201cgreening measures\u201d in the framework of EU agricultural policy and related betterment can give the sector a further boost. http://www.rokwood.eu/ (ROKWOOD) is an EU-financed project which supports the cultivation and effective utilization of SRCs in European regions. The objective of ROKWOOD is to overcome local barriers to the development of biomass regions in Europe. One of the principal and already achieved project results is a roadmap to strengthen the sector in Europe.\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of determining factors, the consortium identified six fields of action which appear to be particularly important for the success of SRCs. These include the implementation of pilot and demonstration projects in particularly suitable regions, the improvement of knowledge exchange between players, the setting up of an interest group at EU level as well as regular information and demonstration events. Activities have already commenced in the framework of ROKWOOD and the concrete approach was defined in a \u201cJoint Action Plan\u201d. A summary of this plan can be found on the http://www.rokwood.eu/public-library/joint-action-plan.html (project website).\n\nOn the basis of an analysis of the political, economic and social conditions for SRCs, various hurdles were identified which occurred in all the participating countries and therefore need to be overcome at European level. These include the fundamentally rather low level of awareness of SRCs and the low level of expertise amongst potential players, an often lacking or incomplete SRC infrastructure as well as limited political and financial support.\n\nThe ROKWOOD project partners are convinced that SRCs \u2013 once the barriers identified have been overcome - will represent an economically attractive alternative to other types of land use. A marketplace for SRC players and other interested parties is accessible on the project website. 93 players - from producers to users of wood energy - have registered so far. These include farmers, machinery manufacturers, contractors and energy producers.\n\nROKWOOD fosters cooperation between the six participating European research clusters in Sweden, Spain, Germany, Poland, Ireland and Great Britain with the aim of improving research, technological development and market response.

According to the latest data available (EUROSTAT, May 2016) a total of 3.8 million people immigrated to one of the EU-28 Member States during 2015, while at least 2.8 million emigrants were reported to have left an EU Member State. On 1 January 2015, the number of people living in the EU-28 who were citizens of non-member countries was 19.8 million while the number of people living in the EU-28 who had been born outside of the EU was 34.3 million.\r\n\r\nFor instance, for Germany alone, the newly arriving migrants and refugees in 2015 exceeded 1 million people and the number of asylum applicants per million inhabitant is nearly 3.000.
