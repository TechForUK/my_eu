In parallel, the team finished up most of the design work on structural subcomponents for physical testing and the simulations of manufacturing processes.

Extensive and comprehensive work has focused on the development of models considering damage from the micro scale to the barrel scale, with proper coupling between scales and careful control of the error in the solution. Reducing uncertainty plays a critical role in reducing redundancy, which translates to reductions in weight, cost and time. A new test rig for large structural components will eliminate the need for a barrel test for certification.\n\nMAAXIMUS is nearing the finish line with final months to be devoted to full-scale validation of simulation methods and test procedures.

The project will allow teachers to look at and share new ideas for teaching methods which can also be shared with other teachers in Golborne and also nationally from the dissemination activities.  We shall look in detail at the Spanish curriculum used and the advantages and disadvantages of it. This will allow us to take ideas back to the UK to see how a newly adapted curriculum could impact upon results. Discussions with the Head Teacher and staff in Spain will give us more idea about how we can encourage and engage our pupils through curriculum and lessons. \r\nWe shall carry out a series of observations in lessons to look at the methodology of teaching and also feed back effectively to colleagues in Spain and the UK at the end of our visit. We may encourage more staff and pupils to be involved more in international activities. With this project and more which we could be involved in in the future added with teachers in the UK having the option to use new methodologies, and also by looking at a revised curriculum we may see an increase in the percentage of children leaving school with an English Baccalaureate certificate.", "http://www.golbornehigh.wigan.sch.uk", "Golborne High School", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA101-012907_coordinator"], ["3EL", "Mejoramos nuestras competencias profesionales para atender a todos", "Golborne High School", 6782.0, "CONTEXT\r\nIES Salvador Rueda in Malaga is carrying out a CLIL programme. It has ICT provision, and experience in European programmes. These features convey constant and demanding challenges to maintain quality levels to ensure continuous improvement in the linguistic , technological, educational and internationalization fields.\r\n\r\nACTIVITIES , PARTICIPANTS AND METHODOLOGY\r\nTraining of teachers in this project arise through two strategies :\r\n\r\nA1 . MOBILITY TRAINING\r\nCourse  \"Technology Enhanced Learning\" on the enrichment of learning through technological tools for two weeks. 7 participants are proposed from different areas:  Spanish Language , Philosophy, Maths and Social Sciences.\r\n\r\nA2 .

The following improvements are proposed:\r\n\r\n* The willingness to transmit the new techniques learned within the community to use them in a comprehensive and unified manner for students' improvement.\r\n\r\n* Our school will have a stronger network of contacts to facilitate the implementation of European projects , such as e- twinning and KA2 school partnerships that will enhance the European dimension, as our management team wants to strenghthen our international partnership.\r\n\r\n* The center will have more resources to deal with SEN students with, particularly disruptive , or immigrants with social, emotional and behavioral problems , which are often not adapted or integrated into mainstream classes.\r\n\r\n* Through the dissemination plan colleagues will  know the benefits of an experience like this , and may take some of the new ideas and materials in both high school classes as in VET .\r\n\r\nIn short , it is worth noting that these activities will  promote an inspiring and motivating atmosphere for the staff that will lead to a more modern and dynamic professional environment , willingness to integrate good teaching tecniques, new teaching methods and practices in daily activities , to integrate teacher professional development and objectives in order to enhance the quality of our school .", "http://www.golbornehigh.wigan.sch.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-ES01-KA101-014094_1"], ["7QX", "Fostering use of technical spaces in higher education", "INVENTYA LTD", 224405.0, "The maker culture is a contemporary culture emphasizing learning-through-doing (active learning) in a social environment. Maker movement puts power in the hands of the people to fund, design, prototype, produce, manufacture, distribute, market and sell their own goods. This new trendy movement impacts global manufacturing as creation shifts geographically to local, philosophically to sustainability and legally to force the adaptation of new IP laws as people move from consuming to creating and sharing. The Circular / Sharing Economy impacts core business models and higher education (HE) must be ready to address the change by developing relevant competencies of graduates in order to secure innovation and growth. 3D printing is not only the main technology for prototyping, but also hyped as the technology to bring about the next industrial revolution. The overall market for 3D printing products and services which hit $2.2 billion in 2012 and was forecasted to grow to $4B in 2025 (IDTechEx, March 2014), actually hit $5.1 billion already in 2016. The comprehensive research has been done by project consortium analyzing around 100 university makerspaces, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Technical University of Denmark, Aalto University and other partners. The conclusions show that similar structures are emerging rapidly but they lack clear recognition frameworks, access guidance, strategic integration of university makerspaces into study process, networking between universities, public and private makerspaces and businesses. \r\n\r\nThus the AIM of the HEI MAKERS project is to increase innovation and creativity through partnership of HEIs and technical spaces, leading to trans-disciplinary approaches and new teaching methods in HE, availability of open resources for formal and non formal education, better entrepreneurial and creativity skills of graduates. To achieve the aim, specific objectives were defined as follows:\r\n1. Foster collaboration of HEIs, university and private makerspaces, and other businesses (addressed through developing Guidelines for HEI on employing a makerspace (O1))\r\n2. Amplify technological entrepreneurship and technical creativity as key competences (modules on technological entrepreneurship (O2) and technical creativity (O3, O5))\r\n3. Promote innovative education methods (training programme as university\u2018s summer school (O4, O5))\r\n4. Increase open resources based learning opportunities (initial package of training materials (on entrepreneurship (O2), 3D printing and rapid prototyping (O3, O5))\r\n5. Recognise competencies gained through active learning at makerspace as per programmes developed (O4)\r\n6. Test the above-mentioned collaboration concept and ensure sustainability of results  (5 multiplier events, including the first international conference on HEI and makerspace collaboration, and summer school)\r\n7. Identify and attract new players who will join the next stages of the project (initial ideas for association or similar).\r\n\r\nThe direct target group of the project is HEIs, their students, and technical spaces. HEIs are represented in the consortium through LT, LV and RO universities, covering 50+ thousand students. These are the countries with less advanced HE (as per QS World University Rankings) in Europe who need to employ modern teaching strategies in order to catch up with the leaders. Association of technical spaces (TEA) and a private makerspace Ludor (RO) represent technical spaces and ensure their involvement in the project through a number of stakeholders. Indirect target group is business and business support organisations, who employ skilled students or host startups in acceleration or business incubation programmes, represented by Inventya (UK) and SSMTP (LT). \r\n\r\nProject partners will develop 5 intellectual outputs: Guidelines for HEIs on how practically collaborate with technical spaces fin order to increase quality of HE; Training modules on technological entrepreneurship and technical creativity in 3D printing and rapid prototyping;  Intensive study programme for international summer school to facilitate uptake of the collaboration concept; and a plugin for open software \"Blender\" allowing efficient implementation of O3 and O4. Partners will organise 5 multiplier events involving 200+ representatives of the target group and pilot the outputs during intensive study programme - university's international summer school. \r\n\r\nProject HEI MAKERS will encourage more HEIs to initiate collaboration with makerspaces and re-think their study programmes to employ innovative training methods and address the challenges of XXI century labour market. Project's outputs will open up new learning opportunities through practical application of entrepreneurial and prototyping skills, which can involve and lead to the commercialization of new services and products, to attracting potential investors, to creation of global start-ups and spin-offs and thus growing economy.", "http://www.inventya.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-LT01-KA203-035231_3"]]}, "esif": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "projectTitle", "organisationName", "summary", "funds", "euInvestment", "projectCost", "myEuId"], "data": [["7QX", "LCR Future Energy", "Inventya Solutions Ltd", "Providing support to SME's who are or could enter the renewables supply chain", "ERDF", 986733.0, 1973466.0, "erdf_england_423"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 322.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the 'Research and innovation' policy area (08.01.05)", "fts_2016_38201", 2016], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 1928.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the 'Direct research' policy area (10.01.05)", "fts_2016_64177", 2016], ["7QX", "INVENTYA LTD", 284980.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_1688", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 57652.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_7430", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 125604.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_7608", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 461564.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_9345", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 58461.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_10209", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 235509.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_10425", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 720490.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_10842", 2017], ["7QX", "INVENTYA LTD", 136386.0, "Increasing innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (02.04.02.03)", "fts_2017_17604", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 127796.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_20872", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 61733.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_27730", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 61844.0, "Euratom \u2014 Nuclear fission and radiation protection (08.03.01.02)", "fts_2017_28942", 2017], ["7QX", "INVENTYA LTD", 97363.0, "Promoting entrepreneurship and improving the competitiveness and access to markets of Union enterprises (02.02.01)", "fts_2017_35473", 2017], ["6AE", "NATIONAL NUCLEAR LABORATORY LTD*", 342.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Research and innovation\u2019 policy area (08.01.05)", "fts_2017_44764", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "WA3"}
