The European SMEs in this sector are under increased pressure to increase efficiency due to rising crude oil prices. In addition, there is the EU legislation on Total Allowable Catch or minimum landing sizes and the threat to close areas to fishing and aquaculture  in order to recover stock, due to environmental effects of inefficient fishing which could have socio-economic effects on our community. Our need as representatives of the SME industry is to increase efficiency and safety in fishing and aquaculture as well as reduce the environmental effects. We recognise the need for a technology that will enable fishers to preserve the quality and freshness of fish, reduce trawling times and avoid problems caused by overfull trawls. Trawls are the most commercially used fishing method. It is very large and expensive with typical cost up to \u20ac135,000. A fishing vessel dragging the conical shaped net through water consumes a large amount of energy and with fuel being the most expensive expenditure, fisheries are fast becoming unprofitable.   The proposed project will develop a stress monitoring system that will increase: efficiency in fishing, safety and life of fishing gear and mooring ropes.", 99871.0, 2239169.0, 7, 15, "SMARTCATCH", "http://smartcatch.pera.com/", "http://www.wirebelt.co.uk", "/docs/results/images/2014/146637.jpg", "fp7_107622_998605786"]]}}, "3RL": {"cordis": {"data": [[1220227200000, 1293753600000, "Development of an ultrasonic technique, sensors and systems for the volumetric examination of alumino-thermic rail welds", "Spree Engineering Ltd", "In 2004 an estimated 5 billion passenger journeys will be made in the UK, France and Germany and the market in the three countries is worth approximately \u20ac40 billion. [Ref. 1] . Based on the extrapolation of data relating to the UK, French and German railways [Ref 1], the 500,000 kms of rail [Ref. 2] on the European rail network has an average estimated 5000 rail breaks annually with about 1500 due to weld failure. Although the number of weld failures is relatively small compared to the estimated 11 million alumino-thermic welds on the European network, it still accounts for about 20% of the total 7000\\ rail failures each year [Ref. 3]. There is no current available NDT method for the economic and reliable volumetric examination of alumino-thermic welds. This proposal describes the development of a rapid ultrasonic method for the safe and reliable NDT examination of the entire volume of in-situ alumino-thermic welds. The proposed ultrasonic system could be quickly deployed on track using a clamp-on device. The inspection scans will be carried out in a pre-determined sequence, and then the results compared with defect acceptance criteria that will be generated in the project. To achieve this objective, a rigorous analysis of the material properties, the defect interaction with the ultrasonic beams and the design of optimum scanning procedures will first be carried out. It is expected that the scans will be implemented by means of electronic scanning using novel phased arrays and multiple probes.

The Sixth Form comprises a consortium of three schools. Two flows of participants are envisaged for the same activity; that is 14 funded participants plus 1 to the EP to travel for 3 weeks in July 2014 and the same for 3 weeks in July 2015. Participants will be mixed gender but with females possibly forming the greater percentage. The project time scale is proposed for two years to ensure that all activities can be completed to a high level. \r\nThe focus of the project, in terms of measurable outcomes, for participants will be their ability to acquire key vocational skills whilst at work placements in Brussels, primarily to enhance their employment prospects but subsidiary outcomes are likely to include the gleaning and raising of cultural awareness and increased confidence. Work activities to be provided by host partners will be directly relevant to the participants vocational areas and are thus expected to satisfy their needs, reinforcing classroom theory by integrating into it European business practice resulting in high quality outcomes. The overarching objective attempts to give participants an opportunity to practise business together with communication skills, including French, in European business environments and further to get these skills validated and accredited. \r\nThe basic methodology is that over many years and with incremental innovations, the project manager has developed a sustainable network of partners in Brussels who have a proven track record in their involvement in the project. A principal aim and context  is for bilateral arrangements with host partners to result in intercultural dialogue, thus enabling participants to gain very valuable practical experiences (office related, being that all placements will be within pan-European ngo type organisations) supporting theoretical study. The project is very important for the Sixth Form, which is relatively small and operates without any European Officer, this being the single European activity on offer in the Sixth Form itself. The project manager is very enthusiastic about both the immediate and longer-term benefits afforded to participants. Participants use the experiences gained from the project in their job and university applications and beyond. There is strong  anecdotal evidence that interviewers are very interested in what interviewees can bring to employment/higher education as a result of their participation in the project. The variety of general office tasks provided by partners will have a European leaning and language dimension (mainly French, though not exclusively) that satisfies the critical added value element. \r\nFor verification and accreditation purposes, in addition to Europass Mobility which has been utilised over a number of years, it is planned to introduce experimentally ECVET instruments; Learning Agreements to replace the existing quadrilateral contracts and each participant to have a Memorandum of Understanding.\r\nIn developing the project, participant numbers were scaled up from 12 to 14 per flow, starting in 2012. To retain the quality elements that have made this project so successful in the past, numbers are maintained at this optimum level, making the logistics and practicalities feasible and realistic, whilst allowing for a significant number from the identified cohort to take advantage of the benefits. It is proposed to include one extra unfunded participant in each flow (see D Description of the Project). The project manager can, if required or should there be anything of significant interest, report informally on the two added participants.\r\n\r\nNote that a \"Financial Identification Statement\" together with a \"Proof of Legal Entity\" (for the applicant organisation)  were appended to the sending organisation's Erasmus+ 2014 KA1 Mobility Project Application, reference 2014-1-KA102-000312.
