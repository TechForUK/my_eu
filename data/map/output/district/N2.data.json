The project has existed for eight years and its target group is business students from the four schools.  The target group consists of young people between the ages of 17-20 and are charaterized by coming from homes few ressources and little or no support. The students have low selfesteem and tend not to believe in themselves. Tietgen BC and HGSI have collaborated on this project seven times, while the two other colleges have taken part since 2009.\r\n\r\nThis project is one in a number of international projects that these four Danish colleges collaborate about. We also send students to the US, Australia and to a number of European destinations such as Germany, Spain and Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first two years at Business College it is important to motivate and show the students the possibilities of adding an international dimension to their education. It is also an important element in the VET-declaration. The project aims to meet the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhance the students\u2019 English abilities and give them the confidence to manage in a foreign language and in a foreign culture, and live up to the international qualifications in the VET-declaration.\r\n\r\nHeighten the students\u2019 mobility including the possibility for two years apprenticeship abroad, possibly supported through PIU.\r\n\r\nGive the students an invaluable international business experience through internships in London, which will prove very valuable during their apprenticeship\u2019s main program in Denmark.   \r\n\r\nOpen the students\u2019 and the colleges\u2019 eyes to other ways of teaching business.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of four weeks of teaching in London in the second year of the two years. Two weeks will consist of classes and two weeks will consist of an apprenticeship in a British company. The project is an integrated part of the students\u2019 business education and the classes in London is carefully planned in relation to the classes in Denmark. Furthermore the project aims to target the apprenticeships so it lives upto the individual student\u2019s wishes; for students who wish to work within retail apprenticeships will be found within retail, for students who wish to work with in office and administration apprenticeships will be found within this area.  \r\n\r\nThe classes in London will be implemented by HGSI. The content is agreed upon by the Danish colleges and consists of classes within the newest information about the British retail industry, business language, marketing, branding, consumer relations and the launching of a Danish product on the British market. The apprenticeship is and continuation of the classes and the student\u2019s interests. The apprenticeships take place in recognized and certified British companies such as House of Fraser, Waitrose and Budgens, among others.\r\n\r\nRound 1: 25 students (October 2014)\r\n\r\nRound 2: 25 students (November 2014)\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to help the students to clarify their further choice of career and to give them a personal as well as professional international upgrade, so their cultural and language capabilities increase. It is the aim to increase their motivation to continue parts of their education in business in international environments.\r\n\r\nThe side effects for the participating colleges are that the international dimension is strengthened which can be used in all other aspects of the colleges.\r\n\r\nIn London the students competences will be evaluated through a final presentation and the students will receive a written evaluation. They will also receive diplomas from HGSI as well as exam papers in Denmark and a Europass.\r\n\r\nThe project has existed for eight years and it has given the partners a valuable insight, which is used in preparation for the next group.\r\n\r\nDue to the financial crisis in the UK, apprenticeships can be hard to find. Our focus will therefore be on finding apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nFurthermore we will focus on improving the content according to the studens needs in terms of language skills, vocational training and internships.\r\n\r\nOptimize our choice of host families\r\n\r\nFocus on the use of ECVET system", "http://www.hgsi.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA102-000033_2"], ["0SQ", "Mobility and Work-based learning, Business College Copenhagen North 2014-2016", "The Hampstead Garden Suburb Institute", 69208.0, "Students from the Upper Secondary School:\r\n\r\nThe participants will be 3rd-year students of the 3-year Higher Commercial Examination Exam.  \r\n\r\nThe students will be taught by native speakers in topics relevant for their curriculum such as - British politics, economics, immigration, culture, literature, labour market relations and the EU. Moreover, there will be grammar lessons and vocabulary training for their work placement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students will be accommodated in homestays which will strengthen the students\u2019 language skills, communication and inter-cultural skills.\r\n\r\nThrough their work placement, they will acquire commercial  understanding and knowledge about British companies. Types of jobs are e.g. office work, receptionist at a hotel, shop assistant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important objective of Business College Copenhagen North is to strengthen the international dimension in the education and to enhance our students\u2019 ability to operate in an international work environment.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough this project, the students\u2019 tolerance towards other cultures will be increased. Furthermore, their increased skills in the above areas will help the students in their future, further education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stays will take place in two 3-week flows, October/November 2013 and October/November 2014.\r\n\r\nThe students will study, work and stay in London, a 1-week language course and a 2-week work placement. When they go to school, compulsory cultural visits will be planned during the afternoons. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents from the vocational training programme in the field of commerce, retail and administration:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to send 24 students (2 flows with 12 students each) to Gower College Swansea, Swansea, Wales, UK , 34 students (2 flows with 17 students each) to M\u00fcnchen, Germany and 40 students (2 flows with 20 students each) to London, UK and 15 students (1 flow) til M\u00e1laga, Spain in  the two school years 2014-2016. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the mobility stays consist of language school for one or two weeks and training placement in companies (retail, commerce and administration) for one og two weeks. All of the stay have a duration of three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project we have with Wales is students exchange. The Welsh students first visit Business College Copenhagen North for one week and finishes with two weeks of work practice. Half a year later the Danish students visit the Welsh students at Gower College Swansea and follows a similiar program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to improve our students' competences in languages and internationalization, as these competences are part of KNORD's curriculum and therefore necessary in order to get the diploma. These competences are also demanded of all Danish vocational schools by the Danish Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose is also to strengthen the internationalisation in the vocational education that we offer and to inspire our students to become more international, and experienced in the ways of the world. Additionally the purpose is to improve their English, German and Spanish language skills, as these are the languages we offer at our college. The students will be able to improve their competences in intercultural communication, and gain work experience from another country.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enhanced internationalisation of our college, will prepare our students better for the job market, and will strengthen the competitiveness of the companies that will employ them. This project will add an extra European dimension to our vocational business college.", "http://www.hgsi.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-1-DK01-KA102-000064_2"], ["9JP", "Staff CPD to embed Spanish across the curriculum and gain cultural awareness", "Martin Primary School", 13476.0, "Martin Primary School is an expanding school in the borough of Barnet in North London. We have a diverse intake of pupils with 52 languages spoken at the school. With such a culturally diverse intake, our school prides itself in celebrating other cultures and fostering a tolerance in children for all those around them. In the past the school has taken part in two successful Comenius projects and has maintained links with these schools from around Europe as well as maintaining a link with a school in China. This year we have become an expert centre for the Global Learning Programme within Barnet which fosters links and encourages likeminded schools to share affective practises on how to deliver teaching about key development and global issues within primary and secondary schools.There are five key objectives to this project; to raise the competence and confidence of our staff in delivering parts of the curriculum in Spanish; to integrate global links within the new curriculum to help children become more active citizens; to develop further children and staffs confidence in communication using ICT; to use our school link to enhance our curriculum and to learn from their CLIL; to create opportunities for staff to deliver leadership and management skills. Over the proposed two year project we hope to send a total of 8 members of staff to structured courses and training events in Madrid. These mobilities will be open to all members of staff though we hope to focus the first mobility on sending 4 subject leaders, and on the following mobility, members of staff who the subject leaders have mentored and passed their training onto. Throughout this two year project we hope to send staff on two mobilities to Spain for intensive training and to meet our partner school. Before the first mobility takes place, we will have a whole school International day to launch the project, celebrating the wide variety of languages spoken in the school and with an emphasis on building relationships with international schools. Following this, as well as sending out initial monitoring/ evaluation questionnaires to staff and students and creating an Erasmus + notice board in the school reception, we will carry out pre-visit activities with the children. This will involve both a PSHE project, where the children will have the chance to introduce themselves and their local community to our partner school, and an art project looking at the cultural influence of art in Spain. Children will also exchange Christmas cards, emails and videos with their partner school. Once participants are chosen for the first mobility, targets and a plan of action will be agreed. Following the first mobility, follow up activities will be completed by both staff and children. Staff who were involved in the mobility will share skills and training with the rest of the staff body. An evaluation of the outcomes of the first mobility will be undertaken. Updates of the project and the progress made so far will be put into the school newsletter and on to the school website and the Erasmus + notice board will continue to be updated. Activities planned with partner schools will be undertaken and communication using ICT will continue to be maintained, for example, emailing, Skype sessions and podcasting. Participants for mobility 2 will be selected and targets will be set. After the second mobility, an evaluation of the whole project will be made with evaluations being completed by subject leaders, attendants of mobility 2 and staff and children. A final report about the project will go in the school newsletter and website. A whole school Spanish day will celebrate the end of the project. We hope that this project will enhance the Spanish speaking of our staff and in turn of the children, through embedding it within the curriculum and providing real life experiences for them to use their language skills. Furthermore, we hope that the project and opportunities to link with our partner school will help to develop our children as active citizens and help them to understand what it means to be part of a global world. We also hope that this project will help to develop the confidence and competence of our members of staff in their ICT skills. We aim to use ICT in order to communicate with our partner school in Madrid and for a sustained and developed relationship using multimedia technology.  We hope that we will be able to integrate Spanish into the teaching of Art and PSHE and to also use their culture in these lessons. We hope that this focus will continue after the project to encourage children to learn about and embrace different cultures around the world. Finally, we am that all members of staff will have the opportunity to develop their leadership and management skills. This will hopefully lead to some members of staff being able to apply for positions and use their training received.", "http://www.martinprimary.barnet.sch.uk", "Martin Primary School", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA101-023559_coordinator"], ["8AB", "Food For Thought", "PEOPLE 1ST", 344332.0, "The Food For Thought project brings together 5 European partners each with specific expertise in the provision of catering & hospitality training & curriculum development. The main output will be the development of an openly accessible modular training course focused on the local food system & sustainable food practices.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT & BACKGROUND\r\nCatering & hospitality VET provide the skills & knowledge required to work in one of the largest & fastest growing industries in EU. The hospitality sector makes a major contribution to the EU economy, supporting 16.6m jobs AND representing 7.8% of the European workforce. Further, the sector is critical for indirectly supporting a broad supply chain for example the agriculture & tourism sector & thus the competitiveness of rural & regional economies. One of the vital skills needs for the sector is the requirement for learners to \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d, to gain a better understanding of the local food system & adopting sustainable food practices in their training & careers. In recent time\u2019s menu trends have shifted mirroring how customers have become more interested in environmental sustainability for example the demand for artisan, organic & vegan menus & an increased appetite for locally grown foods. \r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES\r\n1. To undertake Comparative Needs Analysis in 4 partner EU Countries mapping skills & knowledge requirements which will influence the design and content of the  Food For Thought training course.\r\n2.
