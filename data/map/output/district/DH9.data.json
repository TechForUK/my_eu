The new professions will require updated digital skills, initiative and entrepreneurship;thanks to pre-placement training, work placement activities and the availability of technological equipment in the classrooms and labs and free internet access, ENGAGED multiplies these learning opportunities in Italy and abroad (Digital competences, Europe 2020, Strategic Obj.ve 4 of ET 2020).\r\nThe selection of the partners was based on the skills acquired by the trainees in preceding work placement experiences. With some partners of the Chemistry sector we share ECVET, which is now applied also in other educational environments.\r\nIIS Scalcerleis a member of the European CREDCHEM network for scientific occupation.\r\nWith the hosting partners the learning goals in non-formal contexts, defined in LOUs (Learning Outcome Units), and the conditions for the work placements (objectives, duration, responsibilities of each institution) are agreed upon.\r\nThe content and the quality of the LOUs are determined using tools such as the MoU and the LA.\r\nWithXenathe preparation, the monitoring and the certification of competences are elaborated.\r\nThe beneficiaries of the ENGAGED project are 108 students, 91 from IIS Scalcerle and 17 from other schools who have already completed the 4th class and who are selected according to shared criteria. 30 of them are students from the Chemistry course and 78 are from the Foreign Language course.\r\nAmong the \u201c8 key competences\u201d, here is a list of the ones who are more suitable for our beneficiaries:\r\nKnowing the world of international labour; \r\nGetting to know different cultures, increasing one\u2019s social and civil competences;\r\nAcquiring language skills in more than one language;\r\nIncreasing self-realization as equal opportunity citizens for female beneficiaries; promoting integration and self-esteem in young immigrants (Obj.ve 3 ET 2020);\r\nTransferring theoretical knowledge to the working environment;\r\nLife-long learning.\r\nThe crisis of the labour market dictates the partners to offer more opportunities to their students to train them for life-long learning and the enhancement of their basic skills (writing, calculation, science, technology) and communication skills in a foreign language (strategic obj.ve 2 ET 2020).\r\nThe activities will be:\r\nInformation on the Erasmus+ program\r\nPreparation about the LOUs\r\nThe work placements abroad\r\nMonitoring of the work placements\r\nEvaluation of the work placements and ECVET-directed certification.\r\nDissemination of the results among peers and institutions.\r\nThe methodology used is group work, the sharing of intentions among the partners and the debate among the work placement tutors on the contents and the objectives to be reached.\r\nA supervision group, formed by the headmasters and the person in charge of GATEWAY+,monitors the observance of deadlines, the regular execution of the activities, the observance of the agreements among partners and the use of the budget.\r\nThe final qualitative evaluation will be determined among the participants, the tutors and the whole work group after certificates, final reports and the reports of the hosting companies.\r\nThe feed back for the beneficiaries is the acquisition of the planned skills, for the educational community the transfer of the same to schoolmates through guided debates. The trainers/tutors group increases its competences on mobility and the use of foreign languages. The tested LOUs are transferred into the curricula of the sending schools and integrated in the educational plan of discipline departments.

With some of them there is reciprocity both in the Mobility program and in other LLP and Erasmus+ programs.The foreign network includes various work and/or training organizations: companies, chemical labs, public bodies, training bodies, universities, museums, hotels and others in the tourist, cultural and commercial fields.The new professions will require updated digital skills, entrepreneurship and a sense of initiative; many of the key competences for an active citizenship can be found among the objectives of NAIL IT IN EUROPE.Our ambitious aim is to highlight and promote the development of creativity and problem-solving skills in the working and entrepreneurial fields. These are soft skills that are developed also through non-formal and informal learning, which is particularly significant in the context of a work placement experience abroad managed autonomously in many ways by the beneficiaries.  On a European level, this aim cannot be reached without competence in foreign languages and a deeper awareness of European citizenship.The work placement experience is only one step along this process of growth and awareness and it needs coordinated and solid planning and implementation of preparatory activities that invade the sphere of traditional teaching and modify contents and methodology of the students\u2019 curricula.The beneficiaries of the NAIL IT IN EUROPE project are 105 students of IIS Scalcerle and other schools of the province, selected according to shared criteria which are described in the quality procedures of the school. They are trainees at their initial training stage who will get a High School or Technical School Diploma corresponding to level 4 of EQF. They have concluded the 4th year of their educational training (either the Foreign Languages course or the Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnologies technical course). Immigrant students and an elevated percentage of women are involved. The work placements will last from 2 to 4 weeks.The work placements abroad will be organized, monitored and assessed mainly by using ECVET criteria and will be meant to allow the acquisition of competencies that can be built up in time and acknowledged at a national and an international level in different contexts. With NAIL IT IN EUROPE,  Learning Outcomes and ECVET will be developed further. The content and the quality of the LO and the training objectives will be agreed upon by using tools such as the MoU and LA both with traditional CREDCHEM partners and with partners of other fields.The impact on the school and the staff that manages the project is considerable. More and more teachers have felt the need to be more informed and up to date on the topic in order to support their students more effectively in this experience. The comparison with other educational systems generates an effective cooperation also in the different subject departments, where learning objectives and curricula are updated. In a peer-education context, former trainees are involved to train the new applicants, to act as tutors and to be part of a working team that analyses the fallout and effects of the mobility experience on the future professional or educational life of the students. Besides the focus on soft skills, the project pursues the achievement of the following technical and professional skills in different fields:Chemical-biological:Learning methodologies and procedures in the fields of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental and sanitary analysis; interpreting results, writing reports; using instruments; performing a qualitative-quantitative analysis with different methods.Foreign languages, tourism:Developing multi-lingual communicative skills in the tourist, art and culture fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, leisure and cultural centres, universities, museums; helping in the organization of events promoting the cultural heritage of an area or exhibitions; planning itineraries; managing reservations and quotes.Child-care and educational services:Developing communicative skills which are not only multi-lingual but also focused on the beneficiary (nursery school children, young people in leisure centres); collaborating in an educational team; planning activities in consideration of the attention span and level of involvement of very young beneficiaries.", "http://www.beamish.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IT01-KA116-004989_13"], ["9LU", "Developing language skills", "Tanfield Lea Community Primary School", 1705.0, "In summary, Tanfield Lea Community Primary School would like to apply for funding to enable a participant to take part in an immersion course in France.  We have 7 main objectives that we feel will overall increase internationalisation of our school. Our objectives include challenging insularity, improving language proficiency in our participant (MFL coordinator), increasing confidence with target language, self assessing our school using CEF, building up a resource bank and lesson plans, sharing course knowledge with colleagues through CPD days and developing links with French schools. Overall, we would like to successfully complete actions on our European Development Plan which is to improve the quality of MFL learning in our school. \r\n\r\nThe single participant (MFL Coordinator) will take part in a course to improve French language skills and an awareness of the French culture. The participant has a GCSE in French and has completed an MFL module while completing a degree at Durham University, however has never been to a French speaking country. This course will provide beneficial awareness of the culture and how the language is used within the country itself. These skills will provide a greater in-depth knowledge of the language to share with colleagues and the children. They will take part in pre-course and follow up tasks as well as the course itself. The participant will complete the following activities on the course: language and methodology-specific classes,  cultural sessions and cultural visits with examples of activities to use with pupils, a visit to a school for observation of practice and an opportunity to make links for future partnership work.\r\n\r\nAfter the course, the participant will have gained more confidence, competency and awareness of culture and resources. The participant will work with colleagues through staff meetings and training to share information from the course. This will develop a stronger team to deliver the subject area and increase confidence through resources too. The pupils will also have an impact due to increased motivation by making links with other schools in France, challenge insularity and in the long term, boost attainment in MFL. \r\n\r\nAfter the course we hope to have achieved all 7 of our objectives. We will monitor and compare insularity before and after the course knowledge has been implemented into the school to assess for any improvements. Our participant will provide effective feedback about their language proficiency and whether they feel the course has been beneficial as well as feedback about their confidence level with their MFL skills. Our school will re-assess ourselves against the CEF to look for better teaching and learning in the subject. Our resources and planning will have a range of activities to suit all ages in the primary school and be accessible to all members of staff. The school will collect feedback from the staff before and after training about the course has been delivered to assess their confidence and competency levels before and after. Finally, the school should have successfully found a partnership school through the use of etwinning or the course itself to provide more meaningful learning to the children at Tanfield Lea Community Primary School.", "http://www.tanfieldlea-primary.durham.sch.uk/", "Tanfield Lea Community Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035599_coordinator"], ["0RG", "Non-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE AGAIN", "Beamish Museum Ltd", 207962.0, "The project called \u201cNon-formal And Informal Learning and International Training IN EUROPE AGAIN\u201d, aka \u201cNAIL IT IN EUROPE AGAIN\u201d, is a development of the preceding project as regards its qualified partnerships and the proposed learning objectives, although some new points are also introduced.\r\nThe beneficiaries are in-training interns that will obtain their high school diploma (Foreign Languages School or Technical School of Chemistry, Materials and Biotechnology) corresponding to EQF Level 4 and have finished the 4th class of either school branch; among them there are immigrant students, one student with special educational needs and a high percentage of women (consistently with the recommended promotion of the values of non discrimination, social cohesion and active citizenship), for a total of 110 beneficiaries and 20 accompanying tutors. \r\nThe mobilities between 2 and 4 weeks involve a group of 27 partners in 9 E.U. countries which are representative of working and training environments tested in other LLP and Erasmus+ projects, some of them in a relationship of reciprocity. \r\nThese collaborations are varied and interesting and include private companies, Chemistry labs, public institutions, training institutions, universities, museums, hotels, kindergartens and other organizations in the fields of tourism, culture and commerce. \r\nIt has always been useful to work in synergy with organizations such as Xena (for competence monitoring), Padova City Hall, the Province administration of Padova and F\u00f2rema Confindustria for the training of the beneficiaries on the topics of private enterprise and cross competences useful for the world of work, besides helping in the dissemination of the action at a local level.  \r\nRecent school legislation concerning work experience in school curricula provides for quite a high number of compulsory hours of work experience also for the students of the 4th year. Consequently, the participation to the Erasmus+ project is even more effective in helping the school comply with the new requirements and offering the trainees an invaluable experience that might even steer the beneficiary towards specific future working/training choices. \r\nAlthough the work placement is an important stage of the process of personal growth for the participants, a good project does not confine itself to the period of work experience abroad, but preliminarily it offers preparatory activities at school that cover the whole span of the project\u2019s life. \r\nA qualifying feature of the experience is the planning and testing, rich in content and quality, of the Learning Outcomes Units inspired by the ECVET system and of the agreed upon learning objectives with tools such as the MoU and the LA, both with the traditional partners of the CREDCHEM network and with the ones of the educational and tourist fields, with the purpose of acquiring skills that can be transferred to national and international contexts. \r\nIn order to promote this good practice that can be applied in particular in the context of the Technical school of Chemistry, this year more mobilities will be reserved for the students of the Chemistry branch, consistently with the Key Objectives of ET2020 to make science and technology more appealing while improving one\u2019s language skills, strengthening creativity and innovation as key factors of a sustainable economic development. \r\nHigh quality skills and competences for employability, innovation, active citizenship and welfare, together with transparency and competence and qualification recognition, are explicitly recommended among the 6 priorities of the 2016-2020 period.  \r\nThis important goal is reached thanks to work-based learning provided by the work placements, which have the following objectives: \r\n\u2022 For the Chemistry Technical School: acquiring methodologies and procedures in the field of chemical, biological, biotechnological, environmental hygiene and healthcare analysis; interpreting results and writing reports; using instruments; performing qualitative/quantitative analysis with different methodologies;\r\n\u2022 For the Foreign Languages School: developing multilingual communicative skills in the tourist and cultural fields in hotels, tourist offices, libraries, recreation/cultural centres, universities, museums; collaborating in the organization of events, planning itineraries, managing reservations and quotes; collaborating in an educational team by planning activities relevant to the interests of the participants using one\u2019s communicative skills. \r\nThis project supports the teachers involved as tutors in a process of continuous professional development through projects of teacher mobility (ERASMUS+ CLIL O.W.Ne.R.S. 2016-1-IT02-KA101-022762); this opportunity will be taken this year by some of the tutors that have most recently joined the Erasmus+ team, to improve their teaching competence and language skills as teachers of non-language-related subjects.", "http://www.beamish.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-IT01-KA116-005740_8"]]}}, "outwardCode": "DH9"}
