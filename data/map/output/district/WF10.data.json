It currently has 80 members of staff teaching 1,000 students. \r\nAs regards bilingualism, our institution is a plurilingual school in French and English. Besides, from this school year, we boast a \u201cBachibac\u201d Baccalaureate, by which our students will be able to get the double degree in the Spanish and French Baccalaureate. It has carried out and coordinated many Bilateral and Multilateral Comenius partnerships. At this moment, there are ten staff members who teach non linguistic subjects to six different educational levels of Compulsory Secondary Education and Baccalaureate: (Maths, Technology, Physics and Chemistry, Biology and Geology, Social Studies, Philosophy and Physical Education, together with the Bachibac subjects). Our students get the B1 and B2 certificates in both languages along their formative stay at our school. No doubt that the staff foreign language formation is vital to get this objective which we feel so proud of. To be able to keep on offering our students this service, it is necessary that our staff keeps on getting more practice in languages, develops its communicative skills, implements new technologies and uses new resources.\r\nBut languages are not our only bet; our school was also an ICT pioneer. Today we have laptops, webpage, Moodle platform, school email (including all the students), apart from the webs and blogs form the different departments and staff. Despite the economic crisis and the cuts in the expenses, the school has been backing new technologies and today we boast digital boards in all the classrooms. \r\nThe best use of these resources, applied to the daily teaching practice, with the main aim of students\u2019 motivation and fostering cooperative and collaborative work, requires an experimented staff on these techniques and methodologies. \r\nNo doubt, the best running of a school goes through an appropriate organization and management in a global level; so we have not left aside the staff formation with responsibilities in coexistence, inclusive policies, distribution and management of material and human resources. \r\nTo satisfy the identified needs, we apply for the participation of seven members of our teaching staff in formative activities for next school year. Two teachers will take part in a job-shadowing activity in France to know firsthand methodologies and subject contents included in our School Bachibac. Two other members of staff will get training in new teaching methodologies. Two more will receive formation in teaching non-linguistic subjects and one more teacher will take part in a training activity related to the use of new technologies of information and communication. \r\nThe participant teachers will be selected according to the school formative needs and will be assessed according to their qualifications and merits in reference to the formation they apply for. \r\nThe commission in charge of the training programme management is formed by the French and English plurilingual project coordinators, two professional formation teachers, the formation head of department and the vice director.  They will be in charge of writing the programme, selecting candidates, formation and organization previous to the activity, the assessment and impact of the formative activity and the dissemination process, according to needs.  \r\nWe foresee the following results:\r\n-In relation to the improvement of linguistic competence of teachers involved in the plurilingual project and the implementation of new methodologies in the teaching of non-linguistic subjects. Teachers will be able to develop their work with a higher communicative competence in the foreign language which they use to teach their subjects, at the same time that, with the use of new methodologies, they will be able to convey their subject contents in a more effective way. We will then get a double objective, the training in languages and enriching the subjects contents. \r\n-As regards the formation in new teaching methodologies and the use of teaching resources, we will be improving several aspects in a direct and clear way. On the one hand, the students\u2019 motivation; what implies a higher achievement of the foreseen objectives. On the other hand, we will be improving the coexistence and study atmosphere.", "http://www.brigshaw.com", null, "erasmus_2014-1-ES01-KA101-002216_1"]]}}, "outwardCode": "WF10"}
