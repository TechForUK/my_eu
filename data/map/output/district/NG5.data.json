Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that following supervised endurance exercise training, 20% of subjects show no change in fitness and 30% demonstrate no improvement in insulin sensitivity or worse-still an adverse response. Our concept is that by using molecular profiling of blood/muscle samples we will develop personalised lifestyle intervention tools. Further, revealing the biological basis for a variable metabolic or cardiovascular response to exercise will enable us to propose new targets and biomarkers for drug discovery efforts directly in humans. Using our established OMICS approaches (RNA, DNA and Metabo-) we will generate classifiers that predict the responses to exercise-therapy (fitness and insulin sensitivity). Classifier generation is a statistical strategy for diagnosis or prognosis. Critically, we have a large human tissue biobank, including subjects with insulin-resistance; young to elderly males and females, as well as twins. Our SME partners have significant intellectual property and capacity in the field of bio-prediction, with a proven track-record of collaboration with the team and product development. We will add to the diversity of our biobank by carrying-out an exercise intervention study using a novel time-efficient strategy that we have recently proven to be effective in reducing insulin resistance in sedentary young people and in middle aged obese subjects. A time-efficient protocol is a critical as lack-of-time is a key reason for not maintaining physical activity levels.

The academic participants contribute their knowledge, research findings and expertise and the industry participants contribute their practical experience prior to, during and following the transformation. The collaboration will make it possible to approach the transformation of SMEs into experience stagers from both a pragmatic and a theoretical point of view. Knowledge will be transferred within the consortium by staff secondments and workshops. Knowledge will be transferred to the broader academic and industrial communities through presentations in academic and industry conferences, academic publications and industry reports.

The background to our project perfectly meets our will to join forces in order to continue and amplify an action initiated in 1995 in Aquitaine. The latter promotes the professional inclusion of young people engaged in vocational training.\r\n\r\nOur method: Planning the integration of students in their final year in a European mobility project (long-term traineeships for instance), which may enhance their qualification and confront the competences they have acquired to the realities on the ground.\r\n\r\nWe can find support in numerous \u201cLeonardo\u201d programmes, managed by the ADAST (Transnational Traineeships development Organisation in Aquitaine). Historically, this organisation founded on the 1901 legislation has managed projects in the context of a complementary training programme initiated regionally, hosted by the Gustave Eiffel school in Bordeaux. 1,400 trainees have benefitted from European mobility projects in this way.\r\n\r\nConcerned with meeting national legal imperatives and improving regional clarity, the school will implement the project and thereby become the consortium's coordinator.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the European Union has fully understood the importance of preserving a substantial transnational experience, allowing activities for mobility 12 months after obtaining a diploma.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Aquitaine institutions, namely the Local Education Authority, the Regional Council, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will provide the new Consortium project with human, financial and logistical support, as was the case previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consortium's aims:\r\n\r\nThis grouping of more than 20 establishments, committed to the same support approach towards employability, has defined a set of general aims, which are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 pooling individual knowledge and skills to carry out added value investments\r\n\r\n\u2022 inviting collaborating local firms to a transnational support approach aiming at future recruitment in Aquitaine or within European branches\r\n\r\n\u2022 enhancing the level of required competences as well as adaptability for a sustained integration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging the project:\r\n\r\nCollective management; defined tasks, annual planning; grouping by business or industry sectors and centralizing in Bordeaux.\r\n\r\nThe determination of institutions, willing to maintain job training, will allow our youths to gain the experience they lack when leaving school. Local integration is sufficient for the consortium to be operational from the first year.\r\n\r\nBecause the implementation of the new programmes for the 2014-2020 period is still uncertain, a selection has been carried out to limit the number of participating senior secondary schools, in order to introduce a new participatory approach. This will ensure that preparation to mobility activities can be internally provided during the final year.\r\n\r\nWe are now half-way into the preparation of participants. A few doubts remain for a few, which lie in the fact that they haven't obtained their diploma yet, but also that they still have to be selected by our hosting partners in a number of fields. The mistakes made during the first session will serve to change our selection and preparation for the 2015 generation. This is why a 24-month project is most interesting.\r\n\r\nThe latest working meeting on March, 4th, bringing together the members of the consortium, has made it possible to put forward each member's expectations, to examine the preparation work already achieved and to define a common course of action as well as general specifications.\r\n\r\nAs concerns the management of traineeship information, we are currently working on a specific software programme that has given us full satisfaction over the past years and that will allow us to process all statistic data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nThe network of participants insists on making it easier for young people with a vocational degree in Aquitaine to find a job, following an efficiency system based on the participation of firms that have acknowledged the advantage of this form of training.\r\n\r\nThe results we expect are a modest 50% of immediate employment.

CCIs, their apprentice training centres and partners are fully persuaded that mobility, even if only for short periods, makes the apprenticeship pathway more attractive and ensures that it is just as highly considered as traditional school-based learning.\r\nThe effectiveness of the project lies in the fact that the parties involved (CCI France, local/regional CCIs, apprentice training centres) have known one another for a long while, exchange know-how, pool best practices and produce valuable tools and resources (communication/management/methods\u2026). This enables the new CCIs/training centres joining the project to become operational very quickly and to capitalise on the skills and know-how already acquired by the network.\r\n\r\nThe target audiences for the MOVIL\u2019APP initiative are:\r\n\r\n* Apprentices, undergoing training (levels IV and V). These mobility assignments are of short duration as they take place during training and must therefore be compatible with the rhythm of the apprenticeships organisation and also require the employer\u2019s approval.\r\nFrom a professional viewpoint, the goals of mobility are discovering new working environments and of course gaining self-confidence. From a personal viewpoint, the main impacts are achieving a better understanding of the European area and modifying one's behaviour (improving tolerance, curiosity and adaptability\u2026).\r\n\r\n* Post-apprentices. These are young people graduated (level V to I qualifications in all business sectors) from the apprentice training centers of the CCI and their partners who have completed their apprenticeship contract during the last 12 months. They are registered at the French unemployment service, registration that qualify them as \u201ctrainee undertaking vocational training\u201d. \r\nA long-duration mobility placement enables those people to improve their employability by upgrading their skills, particularly linguistic skills, and their adaptability in the international labour market.\r\n\r\n*Trainers. Usually, when we talk about mobility in vocational training we're first and obviously thinking about apprentices and post-apprentices. But, trainers need to confront their point of view with other European practices. For this reason, the MOVIL\u2019APP project proposes a mobility placement to all professionals involved in apprenticeships. Moreover, being fully convinced of the value of mobility projects, they will be then better able to encourage and promote its development. The project plans the incoming of 4 trainers in company to contribute to the training of apprentices.\r\n\r\nMOVIL\u2019APP also has an impact on the indirect beneficiaries of the MOVIL\u2019APP initiative. Therefore, for the apprentice training centres, the project is a source of pedagogical innovation\u2026 For national and European companies, mobility provides contact with other practices and helps with the forging of economic partnerships.\r\n\r\nSummary of the CCI France application 2017:\r\n=>1846 grants requested\r\n-1360 apprentices (average duration 16 days) + 128 accompanying persons\r\n- 293 post-apprentices (average of 5.5 months)\r\n- 65 trainers with 4 incoming people (average of 6 days)\r\nThe main training fields are: hotel catering, retail trade, food, auto mechanic, personal services...\r\nThe main host country ES UK IT IE", "http://www.destination.eu.com", null, "erasmus_2017-1-FR01-KA102-036275_8"], ["0FU", "Un levier pour l'emploi IV", "Destination Europe", 1120938.0, "P\u00f4le emploi wants to carry an Erasmus+ project for the 2017-2019 period in order to offer to jobseekers a European mobility opportunity.

The new region is characterized by its youth with the highest proportion of under-25-year-olds and student attractiveness. Raising the level of training remains a significant objective for the new region while, at the same time, the number of school leavers without qualifications is still above the national average.

Actually 56 training centers (in 8 regions) have joined this project. Its effectiveness lies in the fact that the parties involved have known one another for a long while, exchange know-how, pool best practices, develop common actions/tools (communication campaign, methodology, management\u2026). This enables new CCIs/training centres joining the project to become operational quickly and to capitalise on the skills and know-how already acquired by the network.\r\n\r\nTarget audiences\r\n\r\n> Apprentices, undergoing training (levels IV and V).
