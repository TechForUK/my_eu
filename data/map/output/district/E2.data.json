Our proposal focuses first on the emerging uses of the web as a tool of collective endeavour and public debate, then on engaging actors involved in two particular technoscientific issues (aging/life expectancy and climate change adaptation) in an \u2018open-air\u2019 experiment using online interactive platforms that will be designed and developed within the project.\n\nIn the domain of science-society interactions, the aim of EMAPS is to get a better understanding of whether the web can provide a meaningful equipment to produce an enhanced interest of a wider public, not as receivers of information about end results of science, but as potential participants in science in the making. Particularly for controversial topics like climate change, the present EU call underlines the potential as well as the risks of the explosion of online communication and the proliferation of producers and consumers of scientific information. To cope with this situation, EMAPS, coordinated by Prof. Bruno Latour at Sciences Po in Paris, proposes an innovative model to trace the heterogeneous networks constituted around science and technology issues. Accordingly, the involvement of  different publics will come from equipping scientists, journalists, activists, corporations and citizens with a political atlas mapping their disagreements on science and technology.

The underlying objective for the mobility to Germany is to improve the image of our students with regard to Germany, the Germans and the German language.\r\nTechnology / Malta: 24 students\r\n4 schools of Engineering want to introduce European internships among their students.  Malta has been chosen because of the possibilities in all four areas of technology and the fact that in Malta, besides English, an Arabic dialect is spoken.

Taking for granted all the above facts, the specific training project which focuses on the important notion of \u2018networking\u2019, is seeking to bring together the majority of the organizations with a specialization on the entrepreneurial fields, in order to accomplish the following targets:(1) The development of an on-line space, through which the young participants (members of organizations with a specialization on entrepreneurship), will propose methodologies for the development of innovative trainings concerning the field, and which will stand for both their quality and high standards in relation to the entrepreneurial education. (2) The exchange of good practices, and particularly non-formal methods of education on entrepreneurial fields, thus seeking to motivate youngsters to be involved with the entrepreneurship.(3) The implementation of activities that widen participant\u2019s network, with an emphasis on the eliminations of general problems that youngsters might encounter during the demanding stage of implementation of their entrepreneurial plans in their local communities.(4) The sharing of well-established non-formal methods and techniques, suitable for both the empowerment and enhancement of those youngsters deriving from the alleged \u2018marginalized areas\u2019, (including groups of immigrants, people with disabilities or even women deriving from countries which cultivate gender discriminations) in order to encourage them to take entrepreneurial action.(5) The creation of potential partnerships and future collaborations, through which new projects concerning KA1 and KA2 action will arise. The \u201cJoining the Dots: Creating Entrepreneurial Networks\u201d training hosted in (London), (UK) by (AR Vocational Education & Training Ltd - ARVET)  from 20 February to 23 February 2017 in cooperation with partner organizations from CR, CY, CZ, IT, LT, PL, PT, RO and SK aims to fill the gaps and enhance Entrepreneurial knowledge among youth workers, especially those from NGOs which may have difficulty in expanding or even carrying out their duties during recessions and need Entrepreneurial spirit to sustain themselves or even kick-start new projects. Lessons learnt during this training will go a long way in supporting these NGOs and their youth workers by developing new, entrepreneurial activities to develop their organisations helping sustain local and regional communities.", null, "AR Vocational Education and Training Ltd", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024841_coordinator"], ["9RF", "Mondriaan More Mobilities", "Mirjam Rouden Ltd", 165665.0, "The project Mondrian More Mobilities aims to expand abroad internships in quantity, quality and diversity. In addition, the encouraging for overseas internships for employees is given extra attention.\r\nROC Mondriaan is a Regional Training Centre in the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area and is one of the largest regional training centers in the Netherlands. ROC Mondriaan provides more than 150 courses in the field of secondary vocational education and promotes labor and / or social participation of students. At ROC Mondriaan learn about 18.000 VET students and 6.000 Education students. It employs approximately 2.100 employees.\r\nWorld Citizenship is increasingly on our agenda. Today's student has to deal specifically with World Citizenship in his profession of tomorrow. Changes in society and in the world of occupations means that both students and staff should orient themselves to opportunities and developments for the new starting professional. We encourage and guide students in discovering their qualities. Using the state funded program of excellence and participation in Skills Competitions at National, European and even World level, it is possible to prepare even more students for the competitive world of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nInternationalization has an important role in this; students in the form of internships; employees in the form of study and working visits as well as being active in various internationally oriented projects. Mondrian propagates gaining international experience in Europe and promote cooperation between European schools. By obtaining the Erasmus+ VET Mobility Charter in 2016 Mondrian proved that internationalization has descended into the organization and that there is commitment for developing international internships participation in international activities.\r\nThis project, Mondrian More Mobilities, is strongly committed to the expansion of internships in various programs. Likewise, this year Economic courses and the new course Dance and Performing Artist hooked on the international  gateway. Also the course for barber and the world of beauty specialists participate in international orientation.\r\nIn this application Mondrian orients itself in a number of cases in Malta. This is because the Brexit probably start sliding contacts in England.\r\nMondrian also launched its third bilingual VET course. Besides the fully English and bilingual course at the International Hotel and Management School and the bilingual course for commercial economy we launched a bilingual course for secretary. Mondrian aims in the short term to meet the requirements of the unified bilingual education association, with support from the Nuffic.\r\nMondrian employees are increasingly demanding for courses and / or working visits abroad. This indicates that the implementation of the internationalization agenda is alive. The participation of employees has special attention because in the past the participation of employees within Erasmus lagged relative to the students. We looked for diversity and new initiatives. In Mondrian More Mobilities we want to send the entire management for an internship abroad.\r\nStudents Erasmus+ program works efficiently. The school plans activity from the curriculum. Its implementation may be abroad and we are thankful for the grant opportunity.\r\n\r\nFor employees, it is difficult. Of course professionalisation is planned but the question of a  course abroad or in house is not yet commonly asked. Especially when Erasmus+ funding can be involved. In the construction phase, the \"delay\" of waiting for the next call takes too much time. Waiting for a wanted course is no good for professionalisation.\r\nWe get many requests from abroad to assist in a particular topic unexpectedly. Naturally Mondrian used its own resources. But for the further development and consciousness we would be able to mention this kind of requests in te application in  such a way that it fits in the subsidy program without being very specific. Over time, it will be like when students work with specific partners.

The E+ Ka-1 funding request for 2018 has a larger number of participating schools and that number is still increasing. Mondriaan has 30 schools and 25 of these are VET oriented. The interest in internships and study visits of students abroad has increased. And the success is great in terms of learning outcomes and student satisfaction. Mondriaan has included in its strategic objectives that from 2019 there are 900 students with an international experiences  and that 10% of the staff (240 employees) have gained a foreign experience at the end of the period of the strategic policy plan in 2019. Experiences are a working visit, -study, (retraining) or knowledge sharing. Mondriaan has 18,000 VET students and 6,000 students in adult education and 2100 employees.\r\nIn 2017, the aim of a percentage of 6% of graduated students with a foreign experience has been amply achieved. The standard of Erasmus + is used (14 days or longer for students and a minimum of 2 days for staff).\r\nAs possible study exchange problems as a result of Brexit, contact has been made with Malta with two schools and a language teaching institution. This contact is further expanded for more Mondriaan training courses and internships on Malta. The ICT school has been able to send students to Hungary and the Czech Republic for a longer training period. This pleased both parties so that here too there is an expansion of the internship offer. The training for Dance and Performing Arts has established contacts in Hamburg, Paris and London and intends to introduce students to cultural expressions of those countries on a regular basis.

As a Mobility Card holder, we fulfil the requests. For example: board members of a Belgian school visited Mondrian, a visit from German with teacher students, we received two delegations from Southern Mediterranean countries and a Finnish school visited us for their knowledge enrichment in the field of early school leaving.

The existing TTO of the Hotel School wants to go to one of the partner schools on Malta. The Hotel school wants to follow up the language trainings abroad. The Tourism school has already reached good results for their student. The relationship with NSTS is strengthened and we think it is a good institute for raising the language level and offering promising internships. For some of the students of Life Style & Movement and Economic legal services we planned an international experience on Malta too.\r\nThe administration for the students and staff who make use of Erasmus+ funding is done by a permanent employee and is going smoothly and transparent.

We believe that the involvement of volunteers will have a positive influence on the process of integration in general. Nevertheless language learning is a field of action were untrained volunteers need support, and should not be left alone.\r\n\r\nThis project will show innovative ways of how volunteers can be involved in language learning for refugees.

The representatives of each organization were challenged to give opportunity to youngsters to discuss their problems and find potential solutions. After this, one youngster joined the second phase of the LTTC and established partnerships at an international level. This project is a result of the involved youngsters work and, for this, a true Transnational Youth Initiative. The partners share the same problem, i.e., not only there is a lack of understanding between youth and older generation, but also the youth is not active in intergenerational aspects in local communities and at EU levels.OBJECTIVES- To create a new communication channel among youth and elderly people; - To equip youth workers, leaders and coaches with knowledge, methodology and skills to cope with intergenerational learning;- To create an entrepreneurial spirit among the youth to become more active citizens;- To create conditions and strengthen communication for youth and youth workers to become leaders who would focus on intergenerational issues within local communities;- To build a network of European Youth, who will share best practices.PARTICIPANTSThe target groups of this project are youngsters (16-30 years old) and youth workers.ACTIVITIESThere will be sessions, which purpose is for youngsters and elderly people to share experiences. Youngsters will learn skills and will be empowered by using other community resources. The topics thought by them to include in the sessions are hobbies; dating; music; movies; cooking; board games; among others. The youngsters will make video diaries during the planning and implementation of the sessions, to explore the relationship created between them and elderly people and to develop and improve technological skills.At the end of the sessions, there will be an exhibition. The main goal is to exhibit the final conclusions with pictures of the elderly people when young (and youngsters) and discourses and storytelling from the sessions. The aim of the training course is to give tools to youth workers, not only about the best practices on the intergenerationality topic, but also how to empower the youngsters while they prepare the sessions, implement and evaluate them. The youth workers will develop social and cultural competences and share good practices at EU level. The blended mobility of young people allows the youngsters to have parallel virtual sessions that will match the ones planned in the pension house. They will have the opportunity to share ideas in the preparation phase or will evaluate the session and share the experience with the other participants. After, they will know each other face-to-face and share the experiences and what they learnt over the sessions with elder people. The first transnational meeting is a kickoff meeting to establish ground rules. The second transnational meeting will happen to check project progress and activities taken place at local level so far. Finally, the third transnational meeting will be the time to checking the progress of current activities and to discuss a sustainable strategy for the project.METHODOLOGYThe methodology will be participative, peer-to-peer and non-formal methods. RESULTS- Increased social dialogue between youth and the elderly, through a new communication channel;- Increased knowledge and empowerment among youth, youth workers, leaders, trainers and coaches of intergenerational learning and social responsibility; - Youth more aware about intergenerational issues and their citizenship in this topic;- Network of youth for sharing of best practices in intergenerational learning;IMPACTSYOUTH:- Increased social-relational well-being, feeling of belonging and identification with local community; - Increased participation of youth on topics of development of local community;- Increased self-empowerment on practices and contexts of active citizenship.YOUTH WORKERS:- Improved knowledge and competences on approaches and tools of intergenerational learning; - Increased capability to activate engagement processes on youth in other fields (politic participation, voluntarism).PARTNER ORGANISATIONS:-  Increased quality of youth work activities;- Increased capacity to cooperate at EU level and to enhance international strategies.LONG TERM BENEFITSThis project allows building and sharing best practices and developing solutions related to intergenerational topics and a possibility to build an EU network of youth who become active in intergenerational issues.

Game based training to answer the disruptive shift that will reshape the youth workforce landscape.", "THE YOUNG FOUNDATION LBG", 102770.0, "n January 2016, the EU28 youth unemployment rate stood at 17,9% (more than twice than the adult rate) and 3,9 million Europeans aged 16-24 were neither in employment nor in education or training, with no signs of improvement in sight. Workforce demand has changed, rising unemployment and underemployment specially in youth collective. Although the rates of some countries as UK (12%) and Poland (15,2%) are lower than the rates of the EU28 (17,9%), other countries as Greece (45,2%) and Spain (42,2%) still being high and represent a big challenge for the public authorities and for the society in general.\r\n\r\nYoung persons who stay unemployed or underemployed for long periods have a higher risk of being in this category, suffering economic exclusion and provoking his/her exclusion from the labour market in adulthood. Eurofound reports (2015) said that many young people within countries are at greater risk than others, and there is a particular need to focus on the most disadvantaged and furthest from the labour market. The general approach is to regard young people as assets rather than problems, and to work with them in responding to their interests, as well as their needs, whilst seeking to capitalise on their creative and innovative capacities. So, it\u2019s necessary to promote (EC \u2013 Expert group report 2016) the soft competences that will deal with the new requirements of labour market together with some technical skills to enhance their insertion in the labour market.\r\n\r\nTo address youth unemployment, young people need to access to training that promotes competences and skills required by new and future social and economic challenges. Ageing society, rise of smart systems as well as globally connected worlds are (among others) new components of the labour market that require specific key and transversal skills as: social intelligence, trans-disciplinary, design mindset and cross-cultural competences (among others).\r\n\r\nThese new drivers and emerging skills have a direct clear impact in social entrepreneurship ecosystem. The rapid growth in social enterprise businesses is one such way to do this, allowing young people direct access to the jobs market in an environment that puts their development at its heart. Social businesses spur cooperation between the public sector, civil society, private business and the education sector - cooperation that can help create new employment opportunities through education, training schemes or practical work experience. Thus, training for social entrepreneurship opportunity represent the suitable framework to develop these emerging competences creating a disruptive innovation in the learning map.\r\n\r\nThus, GATES project main objective is to enhance the employability of young people and their position in the labour market, addressing these fresh competences and skills in the framework of social entrepreneurship through game based learning.\r\nIn order to achieve this main objective, project aims to:\r\n- Implement a knowledge map that includes these emerging (and required) competences in social entrepreneurship ecosystem;\r\n- Develop a new pedagogical methodology based on games to promote future skills in of workforce landscape and social entrepreneurship;\r\n- Build an informal, open and collaborative environment that supports learning and facilitates knowledge and ideas sharing, while promoting joint entrepreneurship activities (peer-mentoring approach); \r\n- Create a critical mass on project topic and involve different actors, enhancing the multi stakeholder approach.\r\nGATES project beneficiaries are young workers who need to improve emerging key and transversal skills - in the framework of this project we can define \u201cyoung workers\u201d as all workers between 18 and 23 years employed and unemployed (we limited the age because by 2020 they have to deal with these emerging competences).\r\n\r\nThe project will start in December 2017 and will finish on May 2019 (18 months), and it will be implemented by 4 institutions of 4 different EU countries: Poland, Greece, Spain and UK.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of the project: 117.688 Euros.", null, null, "erasmus_2017-2-PL01-KA205-039199_2"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["8DD", "STURGIS CARBON PROFILING LLP", 218.0, "Other management expenditure (07.01.02.11)", "fts_2016_25045", 2016], ["8QA", "OURMALA", 46474.0, "Pilot project \u2014 Promoting health-enhancing physical activity across Europe (15.02.77.10)", "fts_2016_56032", 2016], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 1293.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2016_63228", 2016], ["9PJ", "ASHOKA UK", 238378.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (15.03.50.01)", "fts_2017_12304", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 181756.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_15505", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 910.0, "Support expenditure for research and innovation programmes in the \u2018Research and innovation\u2019 policy area (08.01.05)", "fts_2017_22222", 2017], ["6EH", "D&AD", 87225.0, "Culture -programme \u2014 Supporting cross-border actions and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (15.04.02)", "fts_2017_39914", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 171.0, "Other management expenditure (01.01.02.11)", "fts_2017_50713", 2017], ["8DD", "PLUSVALUE", 60011.0, "Horizon 2020 \u2014 Customer-driven scientific and technical support to Union policies (10.02.01)", "fts_2017_53635", 2017], ["9DG", "EYE PRESENT LIMITED", 52335.0, "MEDIA -programme \u2014 Operating transnationally and internationally and promoting transnational circulation and mobility (09.05.01)", "fts_2017_55007", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "E2"}
