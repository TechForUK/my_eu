Although aspects of the two-year training programme have changed significantly, the goal remains the same: a professional contract.\r\n\r\nHowever, the statistics are damning. The Premier League and Football League advise that between 60% and 65% of the 700 or so apprentices taken on each year are rejected at 18. Even half of those who do win a full-time contract will not be playing at a professional level by 21 years of age (source: PFA). Effectively, this means that five out of every six players who start an apprenticeship will not be playing football for a living five years later.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation reports published by a number of organisations (Scottish FA, Celtic FC, Aberdeen FC) have unequivocally shown that participation by young apprentice players in a European mobility programme can boost their chances of being offered a professional contract. Celtic and Aberdeen FC have reported that almost 30% of mobility participants subsequently went on to play first team football \u2013 an unprecedented success rate. This recent (2015) club data confirms that European mobility undertaken by apprentice players can profoundly affect their chances of becoming professional footballers. Both of these clubs went on to report that mobility also had a marked effect in boosting employment rates in other industries for those mobility participants who were not offered a professional contract. Consequently, the anticipated  impact of this mobility project will be to significantly increase the skill sets of the mobility participants which will improve their prospects of being offered employment as a professional player on completion of their apprenticeship. Those participants who are not offered a professional contract will benefit from increased employability in alternative career pathways due to the transferable and interpersonal skills acquired as a direct result of their mobility experience.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this mobility project will be to provide a work experience abroad that not only enriches apprentices\u2018 professional and academic lives, but will also promote openness, adaptability and flexibility, and enhance language learning, intercultural skills, self-reliance and self-awareness.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal objectives of this project is to use the competencies and life skills acquired through mobility to enhance the future employability of participants, whether that be as a professional football player or an alternative career path.

Therefore, Police Scotland is striving to ensure its workforce is representative of the diversity of communities in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThis project application seeks to send a team to learn from cities / communities in Germany, Greece and France:\r\n- Gerrmany: The United Nations Population Fund has identified Germany as hosting the second highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind only the United States of America, with more than 16 million people of foreign / immigrant descent, e.g.  Berlin is a cosmopolitan city comprising populated by many nationalities (around 15% do not have a German passport and 30% have a migration background. \r\n- Greece: According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 1,000,573 refugees and migrants arrived in Europe from the Middle East and North Africa during 2015.  Of these, some 850,000 landed on the Greek islands to enter Europe.\r\n- France: the international media covered the significant terrorist events in Paris, January 2015, and Nice, July 2016.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to \"identify best practice and develop the Police Scotland recruitment and training capabilities to support the development of a Police Scotland workforce which is inclusive and reflects the diverse communities served\".\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are:\r\ni) to identify how police recruitment and training in Germany has responded to the influx of refugees, the diversity of their communities, and significant terrorist incidents, and how they are using Positive Action to encourage people from minority communities to become police officers\r\nii) to identify how police recruitment and training in Greece has responded to the influx of refugees and the diversity of their communities, and how they are using Positive Action to encourage people from minority communities to become police officers\r\niii) to identify how police recruitment and training has changed since the terrorist incidents in Paris and Nice, and how they are using Positive Action to encourage people from minority communities to become police officers\r\niv) to review the Police Scotland recruitment policies, strategies and processes in light of the knowledge gained from the study visits to Germany, Greece and France\r\nv) to review the Police Scotland training policies, strategies and processes in light of the knowledge gained from the study visits to Germany, Greece and France.\r\n\r\nTo progress this project Police Scotland will identify four experienced police officers / staff from specific business areas, supported by a translator, to undertake job shadowing in three cities / communities in each of Germany and Greece, and Paris and Nice to  learn how the local Police Services recruit and train their police officers in relation to their diverse communities,  have responded to significant population migration and responded to significant terrorist incidents, and how they are using Positive Action to encourage people from minority communities to become police officers. These study visits will involve meeting with local police officers, government agents and community leaders over a total of 29 days.\r\n\r\nThe impact sought from this proposal include:\r\n1. development of Positive Action in the Police Scotland Recruitment Strategy\r\n2. integration of  learning into driving cultural change across the organisation\r\n3. increased cultural awareness\r\n4. best practice in recruitment and training to reflect multi ethnic communities\r\n5. training and continuing professional development products enhanced\r\n6 . current approaches to training and development on racial equality enhanced\r\n7. race equality embedded effectively into induction and CPD for staff\r\n\r\nThe strategic intent of this proposal, arising from the impact above is safer communities in Scotland, through a Police Service which reflects the diversity of the communities served.", "http://www.scotland.police.uk/", "Scottish Police Authority", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA104-036048_coordinator"], ["2JA", "Volunteering Matters 2017 EVS Inform and Inspire Project", "Share Scotland", 173851.0, "The Volunteering Matters 2017 Inform and Inspire Project will bring together 13 organisations from the UK, Albania, France, Italy, Austria and Germany with many years experience of EVS projects. The organisations will collaborate through strong partnerships to devise high quality, meaningful, volunteering opportunities which, through inspiring more young people to get involved and make a difference to communities, will promote the sustainability of the Erasmus+ generation. Volunteers and beneficiaries will gain from opportunities to learn about new cultures, reflect upon their own country and social changes which affect them and how they can influence this and adapt. The projects aims to maintain the inclusion of volunteering in communities, with both volunteers and beneficiaries taking action and to promote the positive impact that young Europeans have in areas such as Norfolk, Wales, East Midlands and Essex where most voters chose to leave the EU and where enriching the views of communities and the volunteers may be particularly important. The project will be based in a diverse range of geographical locations across Wales, Scotland and England including Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Essex, Motherwell, Newport and Norfolk. The project will benefit socially excluded young and older people, people with learning, physical and sensory disabilities, people with mental health issues\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n-To encourage community cohesion through volunteering, particularly in those areas of England, Scotland and Wales where more people voted for the UK to leave the EU \r\n-To inform volunteers, beneficiaries and communities about new cultures and encourage them to reflect upon the real social changes in their own countries\r\n-To inspire more young people to take action, to get involved and to make a difference in their communities, promoting the sustainability of the Erasmus+ generation\r\n-To maintain the inclusion of volunteering in communities where the positive impact of young Europeans has already been proven and to expand upon this\r\n-To inspire volunteers and beneficiaries to develop their personal pathways and encourage equity, tolerance and inclusion throughout the project \r\n\r\nThe project will involve 20 volunteers from Albania, France, Italy, Austria and Germany aged between 18 and 30. The volunteers will each volunteer for approx 12 months\r\n\r\nThe activities will include: befriending and mentoring beneficiaries, talking, listening and building relationships;providing support and companionship;supporting people to access social, leisure, sports, education and outdoor activities to build confidence and community cohesion including learning new cultures, trying new interests and accessing local activities, attending education classes;supporting group activities such as arts, crafts, lunch and cooking clubs, supporting people to access volunteering opportunities such as charity shops, community cafes, animal sanctuaries, gardening and environmental projects; supporting people to set up their own groups such as social groups, newsletters;assisting people to access transport, community facilities, shopping and appointments;identifying new opportunities to inspire the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe project will be run through the partners collaborating to recruit volunteers, organise intercultural seminars to select volunteers, develop well planned volunteering opportunities and supporting activities through a system of volunteer and project reviews. This will all be coordinated through our International team.\r\n\r\nIt is expected the project will benefit volunteers, partners and beneficiaries. Through unique intercultural experience, volunteers will learn about the beneficiaries, new cultures, reflect upon social changes that will impact them, gain new skills, knowledge and experience, improve their personal pathways, be inspired to continue volunteering and make a difference in communities and maintain links in the UK. Receiving Organisations will benefit as volunteers bring cultural diversity, interests and skills, enabling them to encourage beneficiaries to become more informed and aware. Sending Organisations will meet their objectives of sending volunteers to a different country to have intercultural experience. Beneficiaries will become more aware of community cohesion through being inspired to take an active part in their communities and accessing social, leisure, educational and outdoor activities. We will meet our objectives to promote volunteering in an international context, increase the cultural diversity of our volunteers, promote cultural awareness and provide opportunities for intercultural exchanges between our volunteer and our projects partners.

It is strategically designed to respond to clearly identified staff development needs through appropriate selection, preparation and follow-up measures; and ensures that the learning outcomes of participating staff are properly recognised, disseminated and widely used within the organisation\r\nObjectives of your project: Through these job shadowing experience, Esplora aims to up-skill its employees in the field of science communication. Through sharing of experiences and best practices with two of the best European Science Centres, Esplora aims to better reach the following strategic values: a) Connecting with Visitors, b) Science Education, c) Scientific Hub for the Community, d) Science Communication, e) Sustainability, f) Esplora Culture.\r\nNumber and profile of participants: 16 Esplora Staff member from the Education Team (Programme Developers and Science Communicators), Front of House (Visitor Services and Guidance Receptionists), the Communication Team (Marketing, Public Relations and Creative), Quality Assurance, the Lead Programme Developers and Duty Managers. All of these participants work in a context of a non-formal STEAM vet-related education programme for students and the general public.\r\nDescription of activities: This project is composed of 3 activities; 2 staff mobility experiences at Heureka Science Centre in Finland, focusing on different aspects of Science Communication and Education and 1 staff mobility experience at Glasgow Science Centre focusing on Evidence-based Management in Science Communication through the My World of Work Exhibition.\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project: Firstly, the joint agreements with the 2 Science Centres have already been made and agreed. Then the participants will be carefully and meritocratically selected through an expression of interest followed by careful preparation and guidance with each and every participant. The Job Shadowing experiences will be held in Early and Late September 2018 and in Mid-February 2019. Finally, all participants will be required to hold train the trainer sessions with the rest of their teams, write an article about their experience to be uploaded on EPALE, Esplora Website/Blog, Esplora's Social Media or the School Education Gateway and finally contribute to a short training seminar for the general public to be held in collaboration with MCAST on VET.\r\nA short description of the Results and impact envisaged:  \u2022 this staff mobility will be regarded as an opportunity for Esplora staff to learn from and to share best practices and experiences in the field of VET and Science Communication, to allow for self development, capacity building and personal growth and to allow individual staff members/teams to view processes they are involved in from a different angle. The impact envisaged will be that of creating better tailor-made education programmes, events and offer better visitor experiences and guidance on a day-to-day basis to school students and the general public. \r\nPotential longer term benefits: More uptake of Science and VET subjects at form 2, more uptake of Science and VET courses and careers at a local level.

Mobility will comprise 156 mobility VET learners, the majority being apprentices, and 33 accompanying persons who will travel to  Spain, Portugal and Turkey. This may seem like large mobility project but the experience of our staff in European mobility is unparalleled with over 50 years of collective experience in Leonardo da Vinci and Erasmus+ project management and delivery. \r\n\r\nEvidence from previous mobility projects has shown that success rates for Scottish mobility participants in being offered a professional contract can be dramatically increased through participation in European mobility, with a 2-3 fold increase in the likelihood of apprentices becoming professional footballers. \r\n\r\nAnother value-added benefit of mobility participation is the finding that apprentices who are unsuccessful in being offered a professional contract are significantly more likely to be offered employment in a secondary career pathway than those who have not undertaken mobility. Unemployment among mobility participants is less than 4%, compared to 45% unemployment in peers from other Scottish clubs who have not undertaken mobility. The consequential improvement in informal learning, soft skills, cultural awareness and linguistic abilities as a result of mobility has proven to be a major deciding factor for employers. \r\n\r\nThis mobility project will enhance the employability of Scottish apprentices and allow them to experience the culture, language and training methods at an acknowledged (UEFA) Centre of Excellence, which is applauded as having world class record in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development.  \r\n\r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n1. Improved tactical, technical, physical and mental competences for participants as a direct result of mobility.\r\n2. Improved employment rates for mobility participants either as a professional footballer or in alternative career pathways.\r\n3. Accreditation and validation of mobility informal learning and soft skills.\r\n4. Improved linguistic skills for participants and an awareness of the cultural diversity within Europe.\r\n5. A commitment to embed mobility principles within the Modern Apprenticeship Programme.\r\n6. Increased maturity and self-esteem among participants.\r\n7.
