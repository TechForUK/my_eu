The Portuguese host partner is a regional training and coaching complex used by Portuguese and European professional teams which are applauded as having world class records in talent identification, innovative coaching and player development. Innovations in physiological development, dietetics, coaching delivery, tactical analysis and cardiovascular training will be studied and used to improve skills acquisition and player development. Improved success rates for apprentices in being admitted to the professional ranks of UK clubs are anticipated, while improved academic attainment and European exposure will improve employability in secondary careers. \r\n\r\nConsequently this project will prioritise the following specific objectives: \r\n1. Improved physiological development of participants via the implementation of innovative training regimes as a direct result of structured Erasmus+ mobility programme.\r\n2. Skills and technology transfer between the Academy mobility apprentices and players in Europe.\r\n3. Improved employment rates for mobility participants in professional football careers.\r\n4.

Increased motivation both on and off the field.\r\n\r\nOur Portuguese partner and the associated local Portuguese clubs are fully committed to this Erasmus+ project, having successfully hosted IVT and/or VETPRO participants from a variety of European countries funded under the previous Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme. \r\n\r\nYoung people in Scotland are, in the main, rather parochial in nature and exhibit a reluctance to undertake occupational mobility. This is particularly so with young people in the region where many have poor records of academic achievement and are socially disadvantaged. At present, fewer than 1% of persons under the age of 21 in Scotland will undertake a work-related mobility placement. This project will directly address this regional shortcoming and will contribute to the Lisbon and Europe 2020 Strategies. Football clubs are fairly unique entities in the access to the media of publicity and this will prove an excellent dissemination vehicle to encourage other young people to seek out mobility opportunities.\r\n\r\nRoss County FC will participate in a Sector Skills Alliance (SSA) involving other UK football clubs who are participating in Erasmus+ VET Learner mobility and their associated apprenticeship training providers. This SSA will seek to improve the content and delivery of vocational training programmes and training methodologies in the UK by sharing European best practice and incorporating these initiatives within the vocational education framework. A particular focus will be put on work-based learning and processes that provide learners with mobility-enhanced skills to maximise their potential for success in the labour market.\r\n\r\nRoss County FC will publicise the project through local and national media, to include television, radio and national and local newspapers. This will be complemented by our European partners, who will actively participate in the dissemination processes by issuing press releases to local media throughout the mobility. Friendly matches played by the participants against host opposition will be publicised in the host region and attendance by local spectators actively encouraged.", "http://www.rosscountyfootballclub.co.uk", "Ross County Football Club Limited", "erasmus_2015-1-UK01-KA102-012814_coordinator"], ["9LT", "Language teacher training", "Dingwall Academy", 3984.0, "The proposed project is participation by Miss Claire Rowe in an LFEE immersion course which will take place between 7th and 28th July of 2018. This course aims to aid professional development for teachers of languages by giving them new classroom ideas and resources, as well as language refreshers to keep their vocabulary up to date. It is hoped that upon return to their own schools, teachers will have the tools to encourage the embedding of more foreign language usage throughout the curriculum, as well as a deepening appreciation for European culture and solidarity. Participants on the three week LFEE immersion course in M\u00e1laga will attend language classes and workshops to improve their competence in oral and written Spanish, as well as professional development sessions designed to give them up to date resources and innovative ideas to use in future.\r\n\r\nMiss Rowe is a Modern Foreign Languages teacher at Dingwall Academy, a secondary school of approximately 1030 pupils in the Highlands of Scotland. This course was the most appropriate for her professional development, as it assumes an existing knowledge of Spanish and expects participants to communicate on pedagogical issues, for which Miss Rowe intends to be as prepared as possible due to her own professional reading. In addition, this course is recognised by the General Teaching Council for Scotland as an accredited course that fulfills the residency requirement for teachers to complete Full Registration for teaching an additional language.\r\n\r\nIn a national context, participation in a course of this kind is vital for staff teaching languages in Scotland. First, because the Curriculum for Excellence includes a requirement for pupils to develop an awareness of Scotland's place in the world, and how it relates culturally and politically to other nations. Furthermore, because the Scottish Government began to implement the first stages of the 1+2 Approach to language learning in 2011. This edict sets forth an ambitious plan to give all pupils in Scotland the entitlement to begin studying a second language from the beginning of their formal education in the primary school, with a further language studied by the end of this primary stage. Supporting existing staff to hone their practice will be key to ensuring that as many pupils as possible can access this entitlement by the proposed date of 2021. \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this course will have a substantial impact on the learning and teaching of languages at Dingwall Academy. Miss Rowe will share her experience with her colleagues in the languages department, helping them to introduce new resources and demonstrating teaching styles she observed during the course. This will create a consistency of approach across the different languages - French, German, Spanish and Scots Gaelic (Learners) - offered by the school. In turn, pupils will benefit from a variety of new materials and resources as well as the increased usage of target language during lessons. The consistency of approach across the department will consolidate pupils' high expectations of their language learning experience at Dingwall. An increased focus on languages may encourage more pupils to work or study abroad after they have left Dingwall Academy. \r\n\r\nA wider impact will be seen through the school community as languages staff will offer to disseminate their knowledge to teachers in different curriculum areas. It will also be proposed that languages are given a higher profile in the school by encouraging all teachers to display information and materials in a range of languages in their classrooms. In addition, information will be communicated to parents through school newsletters and through information meetings where adapted materials could be demonstrated to help parents support their children at home.\r\n\r\nAttending the course will also afford the opportunity to make links with teachers in other schools across Europe so that in time, schools may participate in e-twinning or pupil exchanges. This shows pupils that languages are a practical subject as they can use them in the real world. They can connect the vocabulary to living people, rather than disembodied voices on a CD or outdated pictures in a textbook.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the longer term, the school development plan must be revisited. It is the intention of the school to cement links with the primary and continue to release secondary teachers to teach primary learners each week. Currently, this is only offered with French specialists, but in the future this could be expanded to Spanish as well, helping to fulfill the curriculum requirement for personalisation and choice for learners, as well as the 1+2 Approach.

Club achievements include winning the Scottish First Division, Second Division, Third Division and Challenge Cup.\r\n\r\nEuropean football is at such a level that it is almost a different game, and due to the lack of Scottish club representation at international competitions (World Cup, Champions League, etc) it is a struggle for small clubs like Ross County to skill their players in a way that will allow them to compete at this level. We wish to ensure every player is developed to a standard that they are employable at every level of the game, and at any club in the world, and in order to do this we must expose our players to the practices seen in Europe.
