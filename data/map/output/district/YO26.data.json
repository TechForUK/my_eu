Trainees will undertake a two week traineeship in either animal management studies or wood occupations. Trainees and staff working in the field of Animal Management will spend their placement in either the Netherlands or Malta and their training will be based in a Donkey sanctuary, or a Cat Sanctuary with opportunities to undertake activities in an Ostrich Farm and/or a National Park.  For those staff and trainees who are undertaking studies or training in the field of wood occupation and carpentry, their placement may be in Sweden or Portugal in one of three fields, in carpentry, in restoration, or in joinery, three distinct areas giving participants a different experience and different learning opportunities. Placements will be tailored to the individual participants needs and may include activities in one or more of these areas. \r\n\r\nParticipants taking part in Go Further Reach Higher will be individuals from the UK based in VET institutions who have experienced social exclusion, come from poor socio-economic backgrounds, were early school leavers or have additional support needs. They will be accompanied on mobility experiences with professionals who will aid their travel, support their integration into the host environment and engage in both training and free-time activities with them. Staff from the six UK organisations who form this consortium will engage in complementary activities with the same four host partners in order to widen the benefits within the partner organisations and gain additional learning and new methodologies for individuals teaching in their chosen field. \r\n\r\nUK & overseas partners joined this consortium with a common goal to increase opportunities for European Co-operation, to offer opportunities to staff and learners within their home institution, to dedicate time to co-operating with European partners working in the same sector and to investigate the possibilities for transfer of qualification credits through ECVET. Over the two years of Go Further Reach Higher partners aim to set up strong partnerships which can be built on, adding new sectors to the fields of mobility. Through strong dissemination measures which have been developed by partner organisations over the last seven years involvement in previous EU funded programmes, to increase the visibility of the results of the project and through recognition and validation encourage participants to celebrate the successes they have made personally, socially and professionally and capitalise on these on return to their UK vocational training institutions.", "http://www.everythingispossible.eu", "Everythings Possible ltd", "erasmus_2014-1-UK01-KA102-000342_coordinator"], ["6PZ", "European Mobility: Key Opportunity for a New Generation", "Everythings Possible ltd", 125370.0, "The goal of ADICE, and of the project, is to ensure the social and professional development of the learners (including those with fewer opportunities), by participating in a valuable mobility experience. ADICE considers the mobility as a tool allowing the development of technical, transverse and social skills favoring the access to the market of the employment. Furthermore, the labor pool of the Lille metropolis, and Roubaix-Tourcoing in particular, is characterized by a strong unemployment rate and by an existence of districts enclosed socially and economically, what underlines the relevance of the activities of the ADICE and this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project \"European Mobility: Key Opportunity for a New Generation\" is planned for two years, from the 1st of July 2014, the sending of 60 learners in vocational training, in mobility for purposes of learning, in the eligible countries of the European Union: in United Kingdom, in Malta, in Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Austria, Germany, Spain, Poland and Greece.\r\n\r\nThe mobility project will be internship in an enterprise or in a non-profit organization for 3 months, 6 months or 10 months. \r\n\r\nThe project plans also 5 projects of mobility for the staffs of the vocational training, for the activities of education and training in Spain, in United Kingdom and in Italy for durations of one week and two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project, ADICE will accompany people in vocational training (or having obtained their diploma there is less than year) as well as members of their staff.
