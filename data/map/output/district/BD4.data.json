Waste2Go will valorise this heterogeneous material that has significant socio-economic costs. It will involve the innovative transformation of  over 55% of MSW, the biogenic fraction, into renewable chemicals, advancing beyond current approaches to bio-refining which employ crop derived feedstocks. A cascade approach will be adopted to maximise value. Annually >180 million tonnes of MSW are discarded in the EU27, (in excess of 1kg per citizen every day). Waste2Go will develop technologies to improve waste management and increase value (social, economic & environmental). This will be validated as Best Available Technology (BAT) by recognised LCA experts. It will extend beyond the state-of-the-art in enzyme based technologies for fine-tuned biomass processing and combine them with intelligent techniques for MSW fractionation and downstream processing. It will unlock economic value from MSW and reduce its serious environmental impacts. MSW will become a sustainable source of raw materials for the chemical industry, replacing fossil sources. It will advance leading EU expertise in:\n1) Enzyme research, on rapid and controlled substrate digestion;\n2) Bioprocess engineering and;\n3) Advanced purification techniques, to maximise value.\nThis project will improve the competitiveness of SMEs in the waste management sector; a sector with the highest proportion of SMEs and the lowest proportion of valued added of any EU industrial sector, although worth over \u20ac100 billion p.a. and employing over 1.2 million people.\nThe consortium involves five SMEs, two research institutes and one multinational company providing market pull.

A detailed techno-economic feasibility study and experimental work is required for the improvement of the thermal performance and neutralisation of the bacterial contamination in the recycled fibre waste from carpets and mattresses. In addition, the production line requires machinery for cutting, tearing, cleaning, anti-bacterial contamination processing and packaging at the manufacturing level.

For its duration, T.R.E.N.D. may produce an important impact at many levels: local, regional and national at the same time, due to the connection between public/private bodies from education and professional training and the representatives of the labour market. They would be connected in a profitable exchange of ideas and best practices, in a debate on possible modalities and promotion strategies as regards the theme of youth employability. After their mobility abroad, the project\u2019s participants will be given a new opportunity of internship at some Italian companies, which already showed availability in hosting the candidates that acquired the most specific skills during their experience abroad. \r\nThe entire local Campania territory will benefit from the growth of its human resources\u2019 abilities and skills. These young resources will be open-minded towards a more European perspective, but at the same time they will contribute to the competitiveness of the local productive system and will feed the innovation power that lies within their territory.  During the follow-up, the general evaluation will measure the impact on the participants in terms of their increased job opportunities (considering the number of job proposals that the participants will receive abroad , that are expected to reach the 25%, and the number of internships/job opportunities they will find at their return within the 6 months following the end of the project, which are expected to reach the 35%).
