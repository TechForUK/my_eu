Although treatments have been developed that are effective in a proportion of patients, they are aspecific, relatively toxic and do not mediate cure. Currently, it is unknown which molecular effects need to be induced and/or targeted to prevent induction or persistency of RA.

In the treatment of neurological disease, the blood brain barrier (BBB) still represents an obstacle for the delivery of drugs to the brain and thus a major challenge for the development of therapeutic regimens. Understanding the molecular basis and functioning of the BBB in health and disease, including transport mechanisms across the BBB, therefore holds significant potential for future strategies to prevent and ameliorate neurological disease. Recent research indicates that some neurological disorders have a developmental etiologic component. The major goal of the NEUROBID project is thus to understand the molecular mechanisms and function of the BBB in health and disease both in the developing brain and the adult central nervous system. With an interdisciplinary consortium from the fields of developmental neurobiology and BBB research, NEUROBID aims to (i) understand the involvement of normal and disturbed BBB function in normal and abnormal brain development and (ii) to develop novel strategies for drug delivery to the brain. Unique transport mechanisms across the BBB will be used to target potential therapeutic macromolecular and cellular agents specifically to the brain barriers and transport them into the brain. The main target disorders of NEUROBID are non-inherited neurodevelopmental disorders arising from perinatal adverse exposure, such as cerebral palsy, and classic adult neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and stroke. In the long term, NEUROBID hopes to pave the way for new treatment strategies and thus reduce the economic and social burden of neurological disease. 1. Olesen J, et al.

Their plan was to compare the function of a normal and an abnormal BBB, and identify key players involved in the mechanism. In the normal brain, researchers elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which large molecules (proteins) are transferred across the choroid plexus, and identified specific brain barrier cell surface recognition targets.\n\nThe function of the BBB is significantly challenged by adverse perinatal exposures such as inflammation, hypoxia and glucocorticoid treatment. Using animal models for these situations, scientists were able to assess the effect of disease on BBB function in the developing individual. They discovered that exposure to corticosteroids in the perinatal and neonatal periods significantly increases the risk for neurodegeneration.\n\nSimilar alterations in the morphology and function of the BBB are imposed by perinatal inflammation. In answer to this, the consortium investigated how neuroprotective drugs could restore or maintain BBB integrity. With respect to the transfer of molecules or drugs across the BBB, scientists explored various strategies, including the modification of lipid solubility, and the use of transporters or carriers.\n\nCollectively, the activities of the NEUROBID study promote a better understanding of the BBB and its function, particularly in the developing brain.

In addition, they should have a particular interest in the topics refuge, asylum, migration, conflict and education and pedagogy.Our main objective by hosting an EVS project is primordially to increase the individual learning performance of the volunteer (knowledge, life experience, and attitude), employability, the sense of initiative and entrepreneurship (implementation of personal projects), self-empowerment and self-esteem, foreign language competences (German and French), the intercultural awareness, and active participation in society (a lot of networking) as well as granting an inside look into the way the Red Cross handles situations of emergency. Furthermore, we would like to mention that the volunteers get a lot of space for their creativity. The volunteers will get in contact with principles and methodologies of acceptance, empathy, openness, etc. up to intercultural sensitiveness and communication, conflict and emotional management, and professional distance. Something we strongly believe that will build up their professional approaches to handling situations of emergency as well as preparing them for their future working career.As the main objective of the centre is the support of asylum seekers, this is going to be the main task of the volunteers, i. e. they will perform determined duties in the basic daily work (provision of meals, distribution of bed linen and hygiene articles, reception service, etc.).Furthermore, animations take place in and out of the centre where they may vary from activities involves sports, culture, language lessons, computer lessons, manufacturing or even long-term projects, in which the asylum seeker is strengthened their persona as well as their independence and autonomy.The volunteers can take part in several activities regarding Red Cross training, as well as to have the possibility to become more active and implement their own projects and ideas. As at the end, what we really want from our volunteers is that they show real humanitz and a true will to carrying and helping others.", "http://www.redcross.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-BE03-KA105-013522_1"], ["9AL", "Unterst\u00fctzung der sozialen und kulturellen Integration durch europ\u00e4ische Freiwillige im DRK", "THE BRITISH RED CROSS SOCIETY ROYAL CHARTER", 59940.0, "The project is targeting young adults with different ethnic and educational backgrounds for projects with the German, Frensh and British Red Cross and   its partners in order to raise voluntary engagement in the individual regions but also above them.

The increased interest in a variety of musical styles by music listeners and a decrease of state support to arts generally are examples of these developments. As a result, a shift from fixed types of employment to a situation where musicians are self-employed and combine various professional activities in the form of a portfolio career can be seen all over Europe. The future music profession needs musicians that are flexible in working methods, musical styles and able to work in different professional contexts. Improvisation is seen as a significant skill in the music profession, giving the musicians better opportunities for finding jobs in a wider spectrum of music styles and contexts as artists, teachers and community musicians.\r\n- In the 21st century, improvisation is seen as a crucial pedagogical tool for the training of transversal skills, which are fundamental for future musicians. Reflective attitude, peer-learning and team working are basic principles for improvisation practice and these are exactly the skills that will support the musicians to prepare themselves to be reflective participants in their portfolio careers. Therefore, the partner organisations of this project find improvisation to be a vital tool for modernizing higher education in the area of classical music. To support this, strong courses on improvisation need to be developed in higher music education institutions, as they will have a relevant role to play in the mainstreaming of improvisation and its pedagogical and artistic benefits to the professional musician\u2019s training.\r\n\r\nThe project brings students, teachers and leading experts together from different musical backgrounds in 13 European higher music education institutions to develop new and effective approaches and methods on the teaching of improvisation, both from an artistic and pedagogical as well as a professional integration point of view. Teaching staff will be updated or re-trained with information on innovative teaching and learning methods, leading to higher quality teaching. This will result in an increased awareness and understanding of the potential of improvisation in the participating institutions and, through a set of targeted dissemination activities, the higher music education sector at large. Eventually, this will lead to improved employment opportunities for future music students. \r\n\r\nThe project will implement the following activities:\r\n1. A series of working group meetings meeting twice a year to develop intellectual outputs in the form of new teaching and learning (online), and assessment methodologies in improvisation. \r\n2. The organisation of two Intensive Study Programmes (ISPs) where students and teachers can meet around specific themes. The role of these ISPs will be central to the developmental function of the project, as they will further develop and test the intellectual outputs developed in the working groups. \r\n3. A joint staff training event for teachers taking place once with different groups of teachers to address new teaching and learning (online) methodologies and assessment approaches and to compare international standards of educational and artistic outcomes.

The discourse will take place within a consortium, consisting of three institutions offering the NAIP programme (European Music Master for New Audiences and Innovative Practice), four higher educational institutions offering training in music and/or performing arts, as well as a professional partner in the field of performing arts.This project presents the opportunities offered by cross-border and cross-art collaboration as a tool for curricular innovation, with active participation of academics and students in the field of music and performing arts, as well as players from the professional field. The project's progress and results will be widely disseminated, thereby making a significant impact on higher education in the fields of music and performing arts in Europe and beyond.This partnership project consists of several activities over a two-year period, focusing on developing:1. Cross-art modules2. Mentoring as a tool for innovation, professional integration and talent development3. Online learning approachesThe activities will be in the form of two cross-art intensive study programmes, two blended mobility courses, three working groups, a joint staff training event and a staff development seminar. The activities of the project are designed to develop new and sustainable curriculum structures, both in the physical as well as the virtual classroom, exploring the possibilities of new cross-art joint modules. The project utilizes the international conversation and cross-fertilization in the partnership to enhance curriculum development, and create new approaches for creative collaborative learning in a cross-art setting. The project explores the advantages of an active dialogue between the professional field and higher education, as well as sharing and learning through a critical discourse between academic staff members of music and performing arts.This project builds on experiences gained through previous partnership projects, which aimed at the development of creative collaborative learning in higher music education, emphasising enhancement of personal skills, self-confidence, community engagement, collaboration skills, improvisation, peer evaluation and reflection. In today\u2019s professional environment of artists, the boundaries between subjects of art are becoming more and more blurred. As it is now apparent that interdisciplinary skills are an inseparable part of working in the professional environment of music and performing arts, the higher education institutions must respond to the students' needs to train in a cross-art learning environment. This project responds directly to this need, offering both teachers and students the opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary discourse and activities.", "http://www.gsmd.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-IS01-KA203-017088_1"], ["8DT", "Reflective Entrepreneurial Music Education - Worldclass", "Guildhall School of Music and Drama", 190060.0, "\u2018Reflective Entrepreneurial Music Education Worldclass - RENEW\u2019 This project will contribute to improving the employability of future music graduates through the artistic, pedagogical and entrepreneurial development of higher music education studies.

This previous activity assures therefore the internal coherence and mutual knowledge of the partners organizations and their importance in European theatre higher education context, the assumptions on which this project lays, the commitment to cross-border cooperation and collaborative learning, the pertinence of a particular set of needs and objectives, the enhancing of skills and competences.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are related to the modernization of European performing arts / theatre higher education, namely through activities that explore and debate the pedagogical, creative, and managerial potential of an entrepreneurial approach in arts and theatre higher education. Implicit to these objectives are conspicuous changes in the professional context of performing arts, characterized by new configurations of employability that demand new skills and competences, hence new methodologies in training and teaching. The increasingly necessity of building up an autonomous, transnational and flexible artistic career criss-crosses itself with new ways of making theatre, new forms of theatre displaying modes and practices. Schools should address these needs and work as the first platforms for education and professional sustainability, fulfilling their social dimension \r\nThese are the general motives that congregate the partner organizations that will develop and implement specific activities along this two  years project, being Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Lisboa - Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema (IPL-ESTC) the leading partner. The methodology underlying these activities is clear and its main core consists in practice-based research in the ideology of the project and collaborative learning, in planning, observing and exchanging practices of teaching/learning and training in an entrepreneurial context, in developing and practicing mentoring and coaching skills.  These will be implemented through intensive programmes for staff and students, with international classes and seminars /workshops, described here as Learning/teaching/training activities, and intensive research activity, responsibility of the artistic research and steering group, resulting in intellectual outputs for future impact and transference.\r\n \r\nIt is also of particular significance the position and history of Prima del Teatro, the only participating organization that is not a formal school, having, though, an already experienced structure of cross learning, collaborative creation, civil community impact and international teaching in an integrated learning environment.\r\n   \r\nBeing a project in the context of European higher education, partner organizations acknowledge and aim for high results in terms of quality standards and impact factors.

EdE network multiplies therefore the impact of this project\u2019s activities, outputs and results.
