They are therefore  largely unprepared to face the increasing demands for health services arising from the expansion of an older population with specific  medical needs related to multiple chronic disorders. As a consequence, the medical conditions of a large and growing segment of the older European population are not efficiently managed by the available healthcare services. Among these conditions, the geriatric syndrome of frailty has emerged as a significant public health priority. It is defined as a multidimensional condition characterised by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors. Such extreme vulnerability exposes the older individual to an increased risk of morbidity, disability, inappropriate healthcare use, institutionalization, poor quality of life, and death. Early detection and prevention of frailty are thus crucial to impede its progression and the development of its detrimental clinical consequences, while ensuring sustainability of healthcare systems of the Member States. Unfortunately, to date, no healthcare programs or pharmacological treatments are available for frail older people. This is largely due to the lack of a precise, universal definition of frailty, linked in turn to the multidimensional nature of the condition. Eventually, the existing gaps in knowledge are reflected by the absence of effective interventions. Such a barrier may be overcome by developing and validating a robust conceptual framework to achieve a practical operationalisation of frailty. This should precisely define its pathophysiological and clinical foundations, to assist in the design and implementation of specific interventions aimed at restoring robustness and delaying the onset of adverse outcomes. The present \u201cSarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi-componenT Treatment strategies\u201d (SPRINTT) project is specifically designed to overcome the existing barriers for an efficient public health intervention against frailty, and promote the implementation of successful aging strategies across Europe. \nTo reach such an ambitious goal, the actions of the SPRINTT Consortium are directed towards the achievement of a consensus among academia, regulators, industry (pharmaceutical and medical devices), and patients\u2019 representatives over \n(1) clear operationalisation of the presently vague concept of frailty; \n(2) identification of a target population with unmet medical needs; \n(3) evaluation and validation of methodologies for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies among frail elders at risk of disability in the European Union; \n(4) definition of an experimental setting as a template for regulatory purposes and pharmaceutical investigations; \n(5) identification of biomarkers and health technology solutions to be implemented into clinical practice. \nThus, the project is expected to pursue all the research deliverables described in nine work-packages.\nThe SPRINTT project proposes a novel operationalisation of physical frailty recognising sarcopenia as its central biological substrate. This approach is based on the fact that the physical frailty phenotype overlaps substantially  with sarcopenia. Indeed, many of the adverse outcomes of frailty are probably mediated by sarcopenia, which may therefore  represent both the biological substrate for the development of physical frailty and the pathway through which the negative health outcomes of frailty ensue. Although physical frailty encompasses only a part of the frailty spectrum, the identification of a definite biological basis (i.e., skeletal muscle decline and loss of mobility function) opens new venues for the development of interventions to slow or reverse the progression of this condition.

Crucial in this is the lack of appropriate outcome measures that can robustly identify patient benefit from a specific therapy. The lack of specific and sensitive endpoints to differentiate between responders and non-responders both at the level of pain and tissue structure modification (disease modifying OA drug: DMOAD) has led to trials that included hundreds of patients in each arm with at least 3-years follow-up. Even despite these enormous trials, EMA and FDA have not approved any DMOAD yet. There is a general lack of understanding OA pathogenesis, which appears rather variable and likely reflecting different phenotypes with fundamental differences in disease aetiology, tissue alterations, clinical manifestations (pain/mobility) and disease progression.

The policies, guidance and tools delivered through WEB-RADR will be underpinned by extensive academic research and user testing to ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders, including patients.\n\nBackground\nReporting by healthcare professionals and patients by means of mobile devices and social media platforms to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and marketing authorisation holders with subsequent transmission to EudraVigilance is a new, unexplored concept. The amount of information generated through social media requires a structured, scientific approach for monitoring, reporting, analysing and evaluation of ADRs. Whilst there are numerous benefits of the use of social media, the impact on healthcare professionals and patients and their behaviour towards the use of medicines needs to be further analysed. WEB-RADR will address these areas.\n\nLeadership\nWEB-RADR will be managed by the MHRA\u2019s project management team that are also leading the EC Joint Action (Strengthening Collaborations for Operating Pharmacovigilance in Europe, SCOPE). This will enable the alignment and consistency of the two projects. The MHRA has extensive experience in managing successful pharmacovigilance and IT projects (E2B compliant web-forms for ADR reporting; integration with EudraVigilance; drug and medical dictionary mapping; integration with NHS electronic health records) as well as being a leading regulatory agency, helping to shape the current legislative framework.\nEstablishing clear policies and guidance for stakeholders in the use of these technologies, in line with legislative requirements, is of paramount importance to regulators and industry. The EMA will provide leadership in this area, supported by colleagues from MHRA, HALMED & LAREB. As the central regulatory agency for medicines policy in the EU it is natural for the EMA lead in this area as the outputs of WEB-RADR will have a direct bearing on future operations affecting EudraVigilance, Good Vigilance Practice (GVP) guidance, signal detection and risk communication. Expertise from a national perspective together with EFPIA input will also be essential.\n\nTechnical Platform\nThe development of technical platforms for both the reporting of ADRs via a mobile application and recognising drug safety issues from social media will be led by Epidemico who already offer a number of products through an ongoing partnership with the FDA. Working with SRDC and EFPIA sponsors, WEB-RADR will produce an online dashboard and data feed of data identifying ADRs from social media in multiple languages.

It is essential that data collected use standardised drug, product and medical terms. Mapping of the terms to ensure compatibility with EudraVigilance and NCA databases will be carried out so that terms in the Article 57 database and MedDRA are the basis for analysis.

Antimicrobial resistance, however, is an unavoidable consequence of antibiotic use and therefore new, effective antibacterials will always be needed and once developed should be used carefully, avoiding the overuse which can drive resistance.

Simulation models informed by these data as well as data from past and ongoing epidemics will estimate future public health needs and impact related to AMR, again in diverse socioeconomic settings. Together these constructs will allow for valuation models that will estimate the true value of existing and new antibiotics from the perspectives of patients, physicians, payers, and society as a whole. These, in turn, will inform the creation of alternative economic strategies and reward models that will promote and sustain the development of new antibiotics while simultaneously bolstering appropriate use of existing antibiotics.

The loss can be gradual, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rapid as in stroke, or intermediate as in the delayed neuronal loss after stroke. Following damage, the nervous system is able partially to compensate through the formation of alternative connections and pathways, a process known as plasticity. Adults are therefore able to regain considerable function after stroke, and to compensate for the synapse and cell loss of Alzheimer\u2019s disease until it reaches a critical level. Children undergo a period of enhanced plasticity in most parts of the CNS at the end of development, known as critical periods. During these periods their ability to compensate for damage to the CNS is in many cases much greater than in adults. The overall concept behind this application is that restoration of the function in neurodegeneration can be achieved through plasticity (the formation of new functional connections, withdrawal of inappropriate connections, modulation of synaptic strength). Promoting increased plasticity in selected parts of the adult nervous system back to the level seen in children is a powerful method of enhancing recovery of function in animal models. Plasticity-promoting treatments could therefore be beneficial in a wide range of conditions that damage the CNS.  The PLASTICISE project integrates scientists from four scientific areas 1) Development of methods to promote plasticity 2) Development of models of neurodegenerative disease 3) Imaging of plasticity at the macro and micro level 4) Study of recovery of function through plasticity in human patients with brain disorders.
