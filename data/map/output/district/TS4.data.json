The effectiveness of a support teacher is based on a cooperation of a subject teacher and also with parents. Unfortunately it is not easy to define the model of work of such teacher, because the regulations are very broad concerning the duties of a support teacher.\r\nThe group of two pedagogues will take part in a training/workshops with students with different disabilities in a school in the UK. The aim of the project is to create a model of work of a support teacher, improve teachers' skills and introduce new methods and techniques in working with autistic students. The results will be implemented in the Polish school and shared with other teachers and specialists. \r\nThe objective of the project is to increase the number of mobilities among teachers, make education more valuable and attractive, gain new skills, enrich the ways the lessons are run by the teachers and make participants more confident. Besides, all the teachers will have an opportunity to know the culture of another country, improve their language skills and get a Europass Mobility certificate which is recognised not only in Poland, but in all countries of European Union.", "http://www.beverleyschool.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-PL01-KA101-015583_1"]]}, "nhs": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "organisation", "hospitalName"], "data": [["3BW", "RTR", "The James Cook University Hospital"], ["3AF", "RX3", "Roseberry Park Hospital"]]}}, "outwardCode": "TS4"}
