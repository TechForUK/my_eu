Whist brominated flame retardants (FRs) are able to achieve excellent FR performance at moderate cost and with little impact on polymer properties, they release toxic and corrosive smoke during fire, are potentially harmful to the environment and restrict PP recyclability. There is thus increased legislative and political pressure for a reduction in halogen FR use.

Utilising phosphorous rich oligomers synthesised from readily available raw materials, the MIPS chemistry integrates the essential components for intumescence within one molecule, locked in a reaction state immediately preceding intumescence, thereby enabling:\n- High performance at reduced loading: Rapid and efficient intumescence at low temperatures achieving enhanced flame retardancy and smoke suppression;\n- Cost Competitiveness: Low cost additive manufacture combined with reduced loading enabling additive package pricing in-line with halogen based systems;\n- Superior physical and mechanical properties: non-particulate and oligomeric nature (melt blendable) and reduced loading levels, achieving significantly reduced impact on base polymer properties;\n\nPP-MIPS will further advance \u2018MIPS\u2019 as an intumescent fire protection chemistry for PP, targeting commercial competitiveness with halogen based FR systems and enabling their replacement for high performance applications.

Intumescent chemical systems expand into thick insulating chars when exposed to high temperatures.
