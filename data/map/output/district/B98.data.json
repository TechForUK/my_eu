Even in the actual economic crisis, global demand of A-B class cars is expected to grow by about 5.3% in 2010, with a positive sale scenario in the next years. In-wheel electric motor architecture holds major advantages for these A-B class, allowing high modularisation of the vehicle architecture, increased interior space and improved driveability. However, current existing solutions for in-wheel motor are still in prototype phases, resulting in non-existence of A-B class EV car commercialized and equipped with in-wheel motor, even though the predicted market for this technology is 100K vehicles for 2015.\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this proposal is the design, development and validation of a complete in wheel motor assembly prototype (electric motor, power electronics, reduction gear, structural parts and wheel), based on a McPherson corner suspension topology, to meet the defined car top level specifications. The main technical risks associated with the use of an in-wheel concept are the thermal stress under extreme operation conditions, vehicle dynamics, driveability, safety and durability. The proposed baseline concept will be based on an air cooled motor in wheel concept, with conventional airflow driven by vehicle, and forced airflow provided by an innovative wheel design. Detailed specifications of extreme operation conditions will be defined and validated by the OEM, during the project, including the hot day-cold day conditions, representative of vehicle extreme use. During the assembly and testing phase, the aspects related to vehicle dynamics, driveability, safety, user acceptance, reliability, previously defined, will be validated with the motor in wheel prototypes installed in a test vehicle. In addition, aspects as eco-desing, LCA of the concept and components, dismantling and recyclability of key materials and rare earths will be considered during the in-wheel concept design.", 255981.0, 3891380.0, 7, 14, "EUNICE", null, "http://www.gkn.com", "/docs/results/images/2015/155650.jpg", "fp7_104622_960728256"]]}}, "7UZ": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Developing innovative teaching strategies to improve entrepreneurial skills and enhance performance of disadvantaged learners, and facilitate integration in schools", "Woodrow First School", 97079.0, 4, 6, "The project is designed to develop new teaching methods and strategies, to foster the integration of students from different cultural backgrounds, and with different language needs; to build basic skills; and to develop innovative models of entrepreneurial education. The project will also equip teachers with new skills and strategies, to help them to deliver high quality learning opportunities, and meet the needs of their students. The project will utilize an inquiry-based and learner-centred method of teaching known as \u2018Mantle of the Expert.\u2019 The idea is that students are asked to think of themselves as if they are running an \u2018enterprise\u2019 of some kind; curriculum tasks are then undertaken within this fictional context. The system is designed to empower students, and to make them take on more responsibility for their own learning. The project will bring together both education providers and teacher training institutions. The partners are: a cultural organization (Midland Actors Theatre); UK schools at primary and secondary level (Woodrow First School/Turves Green Boys School); a vocational school in Turkey (Pagev Mesleki Ve Teknik Anadolu Lisesi ); a regional school authority in Germany (Staatliches Schulamt in der Stadt Augsburg); and a teacher training institute in Portugal (Escola Superior de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de Paula Frassinetti).Partners will plan schemes of work together, which they will then deliver in their own classrooms. A total of some 280 students will take part, in different countries. The project will pioneer a model of entrepreneurial education in secondary schools. It will also target young people from refugee and migrant groups, who may be experiencing challenges and barriers to integration, and other disadvantaged groups.  A filmed record of the project will be made; it will be edited and issued as a dvd, and project videos will also be posted online. The films will show planning meetings, interviews with participants, and project delivery in classrooms in different countries. We will also produce a Teaching Guide, with schemes of work and teaching resources, so that other teachers can use the project in their own classrooms.The project will have a wider legacy. It will be rolled out and embedded as a teaching programme in a number of schools in partner countries; and it will also be incorporated in teacher training courses. We will raise awareness of the project through national and international networks, We believe that it will have an impact on the development of educational policies in partner countries, and on curriculum development, in its development of new ways to address diverse needs in the classroom; as an innovative model of entrepreneurial education; and as a pupil-centred and enquiry-based form of pedagogy.", "http://www.woodrow.worcs.sch.uk", "Midland Actors Theatre", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA201-024591_2"]]}}, "9EX": {"erasmus": {"data": [[2016, "Europakompetenz f\u00fcr Auszubildende der Gebr.

If they are unable to achieve targets, then this may have a significant negative impact on manufacturers. Cars also produce emissions such as Nitrogen oxides, Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide and particulate matter which are subject to tight controls. For marine application, existing and forthcoming legislation is aiming at reducing the emissions of Carbon Monoxide, Hydrocarbons and particulate matter. In addition, concerns about rising fuel costs are driving the need for greater fuel efficiencies. As a result, a disruptive technology step is required that will enable the manufactures or cars and marine engines to meet the forthcoming legislative standards. One very attractive way of achieving this is to generate power from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) waste heat.\nA prototype system created by BMW can generate up to 250W of electricity under normal driving conditions that can cut fuel consumption by up to 2%. However, the thermo-electric materials used for these applications to date have a number of clear limitations as they can be easily thermally damaged, are expensive and only achieve low efficiencies.\nThe POWER DRIVER project aims to overcome the limitations relating to the production of an automotive and marine power generation system by integrating cutting-edge nano-structured silicide and functionally graded telluride thermo-electric materials into a heat exchanger assembly that will enable electrical power to be generated from the exhaust system without affecting back-pressure or engine balance. By doing this, the exhaust system created will offer greatly improved environmental performance due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions (CO2, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates) at a cost that is affordable to the end-user.
