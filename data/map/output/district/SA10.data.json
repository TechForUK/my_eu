The job was funded for one year (1/11/10 - 1/11/11) by the Welsh Government who specified that a key outcome of the International Coordinator's role was to submit a centralised application for Leonardo da Vinci funding in February 2011 on behalf of the FE sector in Wales.  This funding would enable apprentices to undertake two to three week work placements in Europe. The application was successful and subsequent centralised applications for funding in 2012 and 2013 have also been successful and have attracted funding between them of over 400,000 Euro enabling 138 participants(the project has included apprentices and IVET  learners since the 2012 application) to undertake short tem work placements in various European countries.  This is the first year that CollegesWales has submitted a centralised application for funding for staff mobility - the focus on improving teaching and learning within the FE sector in Wales has proved to be the catalyst for submitting a consortium application for funding in 2014 under Erasmus+ for staff mobility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology to be used in carrying out the project\r\n\r\nThe Erasmus+ guidance specifies procedures for bids to be entered on behalf of VET consortia - CollegesWales has adopted this methodology of applying for funding since its first Leonardo learner mobility application in 2011.   This is CollegesWales' first application for staff mobility funding and CollegesWales is the organising partner and 7 FE colleges with 8 partner organisations based in Wales.  CollegesWales will also be sending participants on this visit.  Detailed explanations as to how this project will be managed have been clearly specified within this application in the appropriate sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n- to gain an overview of the Finnish education system and the positioning/status of VET within that system\r\n\r\n- to have a detailed understanding of VET structure (proportion of work based learning/classroom learning, VET qualifications/levels)\r\n\r\n- to gain an understanding of quality assurance in the Finnish VET system (internal inspection processes/teacher observations and assessment of teaching & learning)\r\n\r\n- to observe innovative lessons in a Finnish VET school and to discuss and share examples of good practice from both countries\r\n\r\n- to understand how staff Continued Professional Development is organised in relation to improving teaching and learning\r\n\r\n- to explore Finnish standards of literacy and numeracy in comparison to those in Wales (PISA) and how this is embedded into the VET system/how is it assessed\r\n\r\n- to gain a better understanding of PIAAC to help formulate Wales' decision to take part in this in the future\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNumber and profile of participants\r\n\r\nThere are 18 participants involved in this staff mobility project:- 11 of the participants are from seven Further Education colleges and one participant is from a private training provider (all of these organisations are based in Wales) - these are the sending partners/partner organisations.  All of the participants are responsible for putting strategies in place to improve teaching and learning within their organisationsCollegesWales is the organising partner and is submitting this application on their behalf as well as sending 5 participants from CollegesWales' Improving Quality Group.  The European partner is Helsinki Vocational College who has provided CollegesWales with a letter of intent commiting themselves to organising an appropriate training programme for the participants in Finland.   The Helsinki Vocational College has worked for a number of years with Coleg Gwent in Wales on learner mobility programmes.  CollegesWales has  offered a reciprocal visit to Wales for Helsinki Vocational College staff in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nActivities that will take place\r\n\r\nThe visit will last 5 days - 2 days travel and 3 days training - an outline of the proposed training programme is in Section G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact and longer term benefits\r\n\r\nParticipants will return to their partner organisations & report on the visit to the senior management team at the college - there may   be ideas that could be immediately put in practice and ideas that need to be considered in more detail or piloted before putting in to action but the main reason for implementing or piloting these ideas is that they will lead to an improvement in teaching and learning within that organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollegesWales' Teaching & Learning network will provide a national forum for discussing the training that took place in Finland and deciding on what aspects could be progressed within the network.

We try to encourage our students to do work practice abroad because we think it is a very valuable experience.\r\n\r\nDuring some years now, we have had successful mobility projects together with a school in the Netherlands, Lentiz MBO, and we also participate in a Strategic Partnership project together with Lentiz MBO, a school in Wales (NPTC Group) and a school in Finland (Kainuun Ammattiopisto) . We want to continue this cooperation and give more students the opportunity to go abroad for work practice and new experiences. We would also like our teachers and instructors to get use of this cooperation through exchange of experiences, participation in the other schools classrooms , visits to work placements etc. Furthermore we see this as a good opportunity for our vocational teachers to improve their english, with focus on English professional, which will be helpful for our students in the end.\r\n\r\nWe are first of all applying to send  a class of 9 Animal Husbandry students (D16DJ) to do 2 weeks work practice in the Netherlands, the spring 2018. These students will be hosting a class from  the Netherlands this spring (2017) when they are coming to Grans for work practice. In this case we need an Accompanying Person, because some of the students have special needs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we are applying to send students on work practice in connection to participating in one of the course modules we have developed during the strategic partnership project we are involved in (AHENE). The students can apply to two different modules at each partner school; Reptiles and First Aid for Animals in the Netherlands, Beef Cattle and Sheep Husbandry in Wales, and dairy Cows and Dogs in Finland. (We also have two modules at Grans; Nordic Animals and Sled Dogs). The course modules are 4 weeks in total with one week of theory, one week of practical training at school and two weeks at a company within the field of the module.

In the past we have sent around 20 students a year on a two week traineeship with a farmer, and around 10 students attended a practical course in one of our agricultural partnerschools within the Agri-ECVET project.\r\n\r\nWith this application we fuse both projects and we apply for the schoolyear 2017-2018 for 53 students. The strategy is still to send students on practical courses and working placements on agricultural companies, but this time we also want to give the students of the other directions in our school (horticulture, animal care and biotechnics) the opportunity to have an international experience. The project name \u201cWings\u201d has a connection with most of these directions and refers to exploring. The students we want to send out will mainly come from the following directions: +/- 30 students from 6TSO/7BSO agriculture, 12 students from 6TSO/7BSO animal care, 8 students from 6TSO/7BSO horticulture and 3 students from 6TSO Biotechnics. The majority will still come from the direction agriculture, of which all last year students will be sent out. For animal care, horticulture and biotechnics there will be a selection based on motivation, attitude, level of English,\u2026 . We will also take into account the social background of the students in order to give chances to the socially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nFlow A1: 30 students will attend a traineeship in France or the Netherlands. These are students of agriculture and horticulture. These students will be placed on an agricultural or horticultural company in France or the Netherlands. The countries are very different concerning language and culture, but also in terms of agriculture and horticulture. The student can choose the type of company: a pig farm, a dairy farm, an arable farm, a greenhouse company, a gardener, \u2026 We find it important to place our students in companies with a warm family-like atmosphere. Most of the time the students can stay with a hosting family and in this way they experience other customs and other cultures. The weekend is the perfect time for cultural excursions with the hosting family. We go to different countries because every country has its own agricultural and horticultural specialities. The Netherlands are famous for their pig farms and greenhouses, Normandy is famous for cattle and arable farms. The just before the actual traineeship is used to introduce the region to the students. There is a weekend program with cultural and agricultural or horticultural visits organised and accompanied by two teachers. Sunday evening all students are at their working placements and the actual traineeship can begin. In these two weeks the students are also visited by two teachers and in the end of the traineeship the teacher picks them up again, after evaluating the traineeship with the farmer.\r\n\r\nFlow A2: 25 students will attend a traineeship of 3 to 4 weeks on an agricultural school in Wales, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark or Austria. Already two years we are involved with Vabi in a network of 5 agricultural schools (KA2-project Agri-ECVET), and now we will join a parallel animal care schools network, that exists for 2 years under the name Ahene (the Ahene-project is a highly regarded KA2-project in the Netherlands, https://vimeo.com/161062967). By linking both networks, we are in a network of 9 European schools each organizing 1 or 2 practical courses. Vabi organizes one course already in this network and will organize an extra course in the future. At the\r\n\r\nmoment there are around 12 innovative courses, especially around animal care and agricultural subjects. The courses are practically orientated with a lot of visits, working placements, \u2026 Some topics students can choose are: the lambing season in Wales, sledgedogs in Sweden, First Aid for small pets in the Netherlands, high yielding dairy cows, agro-marketing, \u2026 In each course there are around 10 students from different countries and this makes it especially interesting for young people to learn from each other\u2019s cultures.\r\n\r\nWe are growing in our international story, not only in quantity, but also in quality thanks to partners we have known for years, but also thanks to the new partners we are looking forward to work with.
