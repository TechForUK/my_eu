The Dutch Member JONG Rotterdam is takin a next step with applying for this seminar to contribute to the following debate:\r\nProfessional Open Youth Work faces sometimes diverse circumstances in different Europen countries. This includes expectations of  youth work that might change significantly over time but also from one country to the other. On the other hand the expectations that young people themselves express seem quite coherent and stable - as for exampla a youth exchange in Croatia during summer 2014 called \"The Big R\" and working with the young people on their expectations towards  professional open youth work  confirmed:\r\n- a safe place where to explore own interests and feel respected and encouraged\r\n- concrete help & support on practical and emotional issues\r\n- a meeting place to have fun, but also to learn how to interact (interpersonal/intercultural skills)\r\n- a space that provides access to opportunities, possibilities and tools\r\njust to name the most important.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand youth work is also named quickly by policy makers and society when it comes to dealing with actual problems within society e.g. nowadays the radicalisation of muslim young people and it is expected from professional opne youth work to propose action and solution for contributing to solve those problems.\r\n\r\nContent/methodology\r\nThis seminar strives to discuss and exchange among pracitioners, researchers and policy makers in the field of youth work:\r\nto which extend professional open youth work nowadays can meet the expectations of young people themselves under these circumstances.\r\nWhat measures, tools, ressources do we need to implement to meet those expectations of young people.\r\nHow do we match those expectations with sometimes (slightly) different expectations of politics and administration of professional open youth work such as safety, employability,..\r\n\r\nThe seminar will provide key note speeches/lectures looking at the topics from different angles, workshops, field visits and space to exchange experiences and good practice.\r\n\r\nResults/Impact\r\nParticipants and partner organisations will gain knowledge and know how and be able to transfer those into their own context on local, regional and national level. They will also benefit from an intercultural and intersectoral experience and create links to colleagues and peers all over Europe. The discussions and inputs will strive to create more common European values on the tackled subjects and a better understanding of diverse situations in the participating countries.\r\n\r\nPotential longer term benefits\r\nThis seminar will contribute to strengthen a European network in the field of professional open youth work that will contribute to more exchange and learning from each other, a common ground of values and principles and a broader basis of professional open youth work within youth policies.", "http://www.newman.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-NL02-KA105-000767_6"], ["3NT", "Bump It Up!

But if they don\u2019t spread the word, the results and the benefits for society, the chances are high that due to lack of information and understanding, funders, society, stakeholders and even in their own organizations, the projects lack support. Its a reality that most of the youth organizations face in Europe. At the same time it\u2019s up to those organizations to create a solid and broad foundation among funders, stakeholders and in their own organization.

In other words, share what you are proud of!  Because this is what we are, we think that youth organizations make a huge contribution to society and now we will make you think the same! \r\n\r\nJoining forces with youth organizations in Europe is thus also an important objective of this training course. In practice this would mean that we spend a substantial part of the programme to  developing strong  partnerships and carry out quality projects. We will  offer  time and  space  for the participants to explore future collaborations  for short term mobility projects and we will strongly support ideas for longer term strategic partnerships.

Developed a communication strategy that will improve quality, impact and foundation of their (European) youth organization and community projects;\r\nDeveloped new cooperations with youth organizations throughout Europe. We trust that this training course will contribute to improving quality of Erasmus+ projects and development of competent youth and community workers internationally.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to explore the concepts and benefits of working on the visibility & dissemination  of (European) youth and community projects by means of a well elaborated communication strategy and to build network between participating organizations.

During the Medieval Festival of T\u00f8nsberg 3.-8. June, they will come toghether for an intense period of living and working together. During this time, they will work with different ways of dissemination of both thir spesific and common historical heritage.\r\n\r\nWe will make stunts and performances based on medieval theatre forms. These performances will be presented within the market area of the festival. In addition, we will run a small medieval fair with free activities for children aged 3-10, and touch subjects such as historical games and competitions, crafts and archery  - all through a \"learning-by doing\" - approach.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the project is that all the participants as far as possible live togther in a \"medieval camp\" with big medieval tents, open fires etc. All meals will as far as possible be prepared over the fire, which also will be the camp's social midpoint.

The goals is to create more knowledge about open youth work, about youth, and to disseminate this knowledge. The purpose of this project is to build and establish solid and sustainable arenas for a functional interaction between the system of education and representatives of the field of practices. The partnership seeks to publish an academic journal. \r\n\r\nThe academic journal came out of an international working group of youth workers, those that work with young people, NGO\u2019s and academics. The starting point is to explore, research and share youth work philosophy and methodology from both the youth worker and youth work academic perspective.  Its further purpose is to establish a grounded body of knowledge that is based in practice and research, both of which should and could be used to inform social policy makers. \r\n\r\nYouth workers should be able to share results of their work, and also be have a critical view on their work. In order to have a a high quality content of the academic journal, we want youth workers to be involved in writing articles for the AJ, as well as being peer reviewers. For an academic journal, peer reviewing is a sign of quality, and we will aim at a high academic level. Still we want the perspectives of youth workers to be represented, also as reviewers of the academic articles. The peer reviewer role is a process that lasts more than a year, and requires commitment from both writers and reviewers. We will use academic peers as reveiwers. In addition we will strongly support that youth workers have a peer reviewer role, and they also should be writing articles, or be represented by the support of co- writers. Co- writing is  a process where a researcher cooperates with the youth worker, in order to develop research which reflects the reality of the youth workers. Youth workers have normally no experience in peer- reviewing and co - writing, we will therefore implement training in order to prepare them properly for the task. The training course will also have participants from other countries in the Baltic area, and through this extension we will be able to enhance and expand the network. The  training course topics will be about the two different roles in developing the academic journal, peer reviewing and co- writing\r\n\r\nThere is normally no requirement for youth workers that they should master the peer reviewing role, and there is certrainly not any written recipe for how to review with the eyes of the youth worker. The second part of the traning course, will be about co writing. Youth workers are not necessarily trained in cooperation with researchers in a co writing process. Whereas youth workers must create a language for their experiences, researchers must adapt their vocabulary and models of analysis to the youth worker's realiy.

For many years we have sent students abroad for vocational training with very good results and our intention is to continue this work in 2016-2018 so that more students are able to participate. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and St Eskils gymnasium, currently has an Erasmus+ KA1 VET project which will end in June, 2016.    We intend to continue the collaboration that we have with our partners from that project and also add some new ones.   The number of participating students in our new project will be increased from 72 to 104 and they are in vocational programs within the fields of Restaurant, Trade and administration, Building, Mechanics, Childcare, Nursing and health care, Hairdressing and Hotel /Tourism.   These students will do vocational training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxemburg and Malta for 2-5 weeks.  Furthermore, five teachers from the programs Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism will do job shadowing in Great Britain and the Netherlands.  The municipality of Eskilstuna, like many other municipalities in Sweden, struggles with a decreasing number of students applying for vocational programs, a high number of students who do not finish their education, high youth unemployment and also increasing problems of racism and hostility towards immigrants.  The consortium needs to offer high quality vocational programs, prevent drop-outs and also increase the knowledge of languages and trade related subjects among the students.  Moreover, the students\u2019 personal development is important in terms of self-confidence, intercultural understanding and tolerance of others.  Vocational training abroad and the international dimension that it offers, can contribute a lot in these areas and lead to a better future for many people.   Vocational training abroad gives the students experiences out of the ordinary and makes the vocational programs more interesting and appealing.  It gives the students more knowledge within the field, they get to experience different kinds of techniques and ways of doing things and also different ways of thinking.  The job shadowing in the Hairdressing and Hotel/Tourism programs will add positive aspects to the programs, with new ideas and also a collaborative project between the different schools including the vocational subjects and English. This international dimension will be positive for the students and increase their knowledge in these subjects. The vocational training leads to great personal development for the students in terms of self-confidence, the ability to communicate in a different language (especially English), having  more faith in their abilities and a greater courage.  Being able to spend time in a foreign country without one\u2019s family is a big step to take and contributes a lot to the students\u2019 self-confidence and the feeling of having had the courage and succeeded.   It can inspire students who are at risk of not completing their education to actually find the strength to do so.  Vocational training abroad can also make it easier for student to find employment .  In combination with a greater self-confidence and better knowledge of the field, the increased knowledge of foreign languages can make the students more employable.   These students will be important in a job market which is becoming more and more global.   We believe that these students can inspire others to find the courage and perhaps look for employment elsewhere, since unemployment is very high in Eskilstuna. During the training abroad the students get to experience a different culture than their own.  They meet people of different backgrounds, and get a better understanding for intercultural differences.  Since they have to speak a foreign language, they will better understand the difficulties that this can mean when somebody is  trying to make him- or herself understood in a language that is not his or her own.  We hope for positive effects of dissemination when students share their experiences with friends or classmates, and that this will create a better understanding for, and acceptance of, newly arrived asylum seeking students and other immigrants.

They will spend a week at one of our partner schools within the BCPP where they will have the opportunity to learn and get valuable experience that will be used in the quality development of their own schools.  \r\n\r\nIn this project the consortium has three objectives:\r\n\u2022 We want to gain knowledge and experience that will lead to a positive development of our schools with the aim to improve the quality of teaching and improve the pupils\u2019 results.   Besides looking at teaching methods, we would like to see how the staff and the teaching are organized in order to make the most optimal use of the resources and also how different schools work with collegial learning.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 Through the job shadowing activities we want to gain knowledge and experience which leads to a development of methods in order to take care of and educate pupils who have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  We want to develop their knowledge of Swedish and to maximize their learning and results in the multicultural classroom.  Eskilstuna is a multicultural city where 31% of the pupils have a different mother tongue than Swedish.  \r\n\r\n\u2022 We want to improve the quality and results within special pedagogy by educating the staff in finding and developing different teaching methods and tools in the teaching of special needs pupils.

Collegial learning will be a different factor in this work.\r\nThe development will also be driven forward by the Development unit at the Childcare and Education department.  Here there are networks for head teachers, deputy head teachers and leaders of learning where discussions and dissemination activities will take place, in order to share the experiences that have been made during the job shadowing activities with colleagues who are not in the project.  This way, the job shadowing activities can lead to positive development at other schools as well.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the knowledge and experience which we gain from the job shadowing activities will contribute to an improved quality of teaching and better results in general, but also more specifically within the teaching of Swedish as a second language in the multicultural classroom and within special pedagogics.

The international dimension is very important and helps us compare, reflect and learn from each other so that we can develop methods to improve the quality of teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe Municipality has a need to prepare the pupils for a global labor market, encourage and inspire them to learn foreign languages and to offer the pupils contact with pupils in other parts of the world.  International projects are a very important tool in this work, and also contribute to an increased tolerance and acceptance of other people and cultures.  This is very important since our municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, just as in the rest of the country and EU, and the consortium has a need to always work on these issues.     \r\n\r\nIn this project, the consortium consists of the Childcare and Education department and eight primary / secondary schools.  Considering the above mentioned issues, and considering that international contacts and projects are an excellent tool in this work, the consortium has the following objectives in this project:  \r\n \r\n\u2022 Enable international contacts for head teachers, teachers and pupils\r\n\u2022 Increase the number of schools who have international projects and collaboration \u2013 Currently several of the primary / secondary schools are involved in international projects, but there is also a huge number who isn\u2019t.  It is also important to maintain the interest for internationalization at the schools where projects already exist.  \r\n\u2022 Increase the language competence and the interest in foreign languages, for head teachers, teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nIn our project there are eight head teachers and three deputy head teachers from the schools G\u00f6kstensskolan, Hammarg\u00e4rdets skola, \u00c4rstaskolan, Tegelviken, Bj\u00f6rktorpsskolan, Skiftingehus, Fr\u00f6slundaskolan och St\u00e5lforsskolan. All of them will do job shadowing activities in Birmingham, where they will have the opportunity to get inspiration and and ideas which will help them in their strategic quality development of their schools.  They will also be able to establish contacts for international collaboration for head teachers, teachers and pupils.   Furthermore, the job shadowing gives them a chance to improve their English, which will be valuable in their future collaboration.  For many years we have collaborated with Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership (BCPP) and these job shadowing activities are part of that collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe head teachers (all but one) will also take a course in order to learn more about Erasmus+ and how it can be effective in the strategic development of the school and in the collaboration with teachers and pupils from other countries.  They will learn how to anchor Erasmus+ in the work of the organization and use it as a tool.  The course also gives them a good opportunity to meet others and make connections for future KA1 and KA2 projects, as well as an opportunity to improve their language ability.  \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the activities will lead to more schools in Eskilstuna having international projects and international collaboration.  Moreover, these projects are expected to lead to increased language ability among head teachers, teachers and pupils, to increased tolerance and understanding of different cultures and to make the pupils prepared for an international labor market.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038787_6"], ["3NT", "SPICE - School leaders\u2019 development of Practices conductive to Inclusion and Collaborative Learning in Education", "Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership", 14243.0, "The project applicant is V\u00e4ster\u00e5s stad barn och utbildningsf\u00f6rvaltning. It is the coordinator of a consortium consisting of nine of the primary and lower secondary schools of the organisation. The organisation as a whole is looking for quality development on all levels and in all aspects. The project is intended to be an important link in the continuous search for improvement and the pursuit of the consortium's and each member organisation's goals, in particular concerning inclusion, inclusive learning environments, participatory practices and collaborative learning. It is also expected to meet the need to learn from others' good practices concerning state-of-the-art teaching methods, ICT in teaching, and attitudes conductive to students participating in their own learning processes. \r\nThe project main activity consists of job-shadowing experiences for ten school leaders in schools in Birmingham and London, and thereafter implementation of their acquired knowledge in the practice of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s stad barn och utbildningsf\u00f6rvaltning overall, and in particular in each consortia member school. \r\nEach participant will be placed in a school, matched to their needs and interests, during a week. They will follow a fellow school leader, understand how they work and organise the teaching, learning, staff and student activities, but also take part in the schools everyday work and good practice. The plan is to send to two school leaders at the same time and place, with individual placements as this will enable the participants to continuously reflect together on what they have experienced and learned. They are thereby also expected to compile information for their report to their colleagues in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s.\r\nThe focus areas and the competences sought for are deeply embedded in the school administration organisation and in the whole group of leaders. The ten participants, in addition to their own needs, have been chosen with respect to their capability to integrate and implement what they have experienced in their organisations. As they are school leaders, they will be able to lead their staff and organise teaching and learning activities in accordance with best practice.\r\nThe participants will contribute to the development of the whole group of school leaders in the compulsory school (kommunala grundskolan) of the city, in all 45 leaders, as they meet every week to plan, develop and support each other in the ambition to work for continuous improvements according to the overall strategic plan and their local activity plans. The participants will continuously report what they have experienced and how they have adapted it to their own conditions in their organisations. The participants are also expected to learn from how others organise teaching and learning in general, and gain new insights in their role as leaders.\r\nThe receiving partners have been chosen because they can provide the job-shadowing experience considered to be the best option for the participating school leaders. The partners are known to the applicant organisation, and have been proven to be good partners. The partners both represent organisations that work with school development, inclusion, inclusive learning environments, and participatory practices. These are fields in which the British schools are at the forefront of development. The partners have been informed about the participants' main areas of interest and the participants will be individually matched to their placements accordingly, in cooperation with the Swedish coordinator. \r\nThe partner organisations are expected to benefit from shared experiences and discussions around good practice with the visiting Swedish school leaders. The cooperation is also expected to lead to extended personal networks and foster future collaboration between the partners.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA101-038997_2"], ["3NT", "Learning abroad - vocational training 2018-2020", "Birmingham Catholic Primary Partnership", 281374.0, "Eskilstuna Municipality and its upper secondary schools have for many years been convinced that internationalization is important and have sent many students from the VET programs abroad to do practical training. The consortium, which consists of the Childcare and Education department and the upper secondary schools Rekarnegymnasiet, Rinmangymnasiet and S:t Eskils gymnasium, have previously had an Erasmus + KA1 VET project (2014-2016) and they also have an ongoing KA1 VET project (2016-2018). In these projects, the results have been very good and the cooperation with our partner organizations has expanded and deepened. Our goal and intention is to continue to develop this work so that more and more students have the opportunity to do training abroad because it leads to so many positive aspects.\r\n\r\nThis project includes the vocational programs Childcare, Health care, Restaurant, Trade (retail) and Administration, Vehicle maintenance and Transportation, Construction, Tourism as well as Hairdresser.   During 2018-2020, a total of 120 Students will do practical training at our partner organizations in Germany, Great Britain, France, Spain, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Malta for 2-5 weeks. The training is consistent with the objectives of the different programs and courses and therefore the students gain more knowledge in their field. It gives the students an opportunity to practice what they learned at schools and at their local placements, but in a different context from what they are used to. Students will also be able to learn other methods or techniques, which they may not have learned at school or at their internship at home. They get a chance to discuss and compare what they learn. This is beneficial also to other students in the program because there is a large degree of dissemination of the students\u2019 experiences and knowledge once they come home.\r\n\r\nWe firmly believe that the practical training abroad helps make the vocational programs more popular.  For many years Eskilstuna had a decreasing number of applicants for the vocational programs.  However, since 2016, we have seen a turnaround as many of the programs have received a larger number of applicants. It is important that this continues, because Eskilstuna and the rest of the country have a need for skilled labor.  \r\n\r\nThe training can also act as a motivator for students to attend classes and be responsible about the school work, and thus decrease the risk of their becoming drop-outs.  The experience strengthens the students and makes them more confident.  It contributes therefore to the students having the strength and ambition to finish their studies.    The students develop their problem solving skills, their ability to become responsible and their courage because they have to learn how to handle new situations and express themselves in a different language.  This is important for their future, for their ability to finish their studies and start new ones and also to find employment.  The youth unemployment rate of Eskilstuna is 15.5% and our goal is that the students will be more willing to commute and  look for work in other places, if needed- which is something they perhaps wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do or wouldn\u2019t have thought of otherwise, if they hadn\u2019t done the training abroad.   \r\nDuring the training the students also develop their language ability (especially English) which is essential in a labor market which becomes more and more global, where companies need to have staff who can communicate with clients and other companies around the world.  \r\n\r\nOur municipalilty has received a large number of refugees in the last couple of years and has a long history of having a population with a mixed cultural background.  Racism and hostility towards other cultures is a growing problem here, and the consortium has a need to always work with these issues, to increase the tolerance and and empathy for others.  The students\u2019 practical training in other European countries contributes to a larger intercultural understanding since they can experience a different culture and meet people of a different background than themselves.  It also contributes to an understanding for how it might feel to arrive in a foreign country, and to have difficultites expressing oneself.  There are many newly arrived studentens in our schools and our hope is that these training periods can contribute to a greater understanding for them and their situations.  \r\n\r\nThis project also includes job shadowing activities in France for 6 teachers at the Vehicle/Transportation program.  The teachers want to develop their language ability, discuss pedagogics, didactics, curriculum and lesson plans, and thus have an opportunity to get new ideas and inspiration, learn new techniques etc from a program similar to their own.  The teachers want to plan for further collaboration with the partner school, and this collaboration will be beneficial to the whole program.", "http://www.bcpp.org.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-SE01-KA102-038808_5"]]}}, "outwardCode": "B32"}
