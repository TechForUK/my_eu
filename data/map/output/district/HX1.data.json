To achieve this goal, BrightAnimal has the following mission:  To produce a framework for European and non-European small and medium enterprises on effective and acceptable precision livestock farming and to create an international, interdisciplinary network for further development and dissemination.   The main activity and achievement of BrightAnimal will be the elaboration of a book on effective Precision Livestock Farming in Europe and world-wide with special consideration of small and medium enterprises. The book aims at describing current and near-future techniques in PLF, especially taking into account both the practicality for SMEs as well as their acceptability (in the broader sense). The book will also try to set the scene for future developments.   As the second component of the framework, BrightAnimal will produce best precision livestock farming practices (BPLFP) in a series of \u201cproblematic\u201d areas such as aquaculture, beef, sheep and chicken. These best practice guides will be released to the public domain in the form of booklets.   A third deliverable of the project will be a practical showcase activity showing the Good Practices in action in the European Centre of Excellence of Automatic Identification and Data Capture in the UK.   BrightAnimal will organise interdisciplinary conferences for opinion exchange and cross-disciplinary discussions.   It is of great importance to include opinions from outside Europe.  We have been pleased to accept partners from the following ICPC countries: Thailand,  Malaysia, South Africa, Brazil and China and from Australia as a third country.  Other non-funded partners from third countries will also join the project.", 55519.0, 994453.0, "BRIGHTANIMAL", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_91265_999676278"], ["5ER", "Coordination and Support Action for Global RFID-related Activities and Standardisation", "Aidc Uk Ltd", "Standardisation, and associated regulations, in respect of RFID is of critical importance in realising open systems applications of global significance, such as supply chain traceability and logistics. Of parallel significance is the numbering and identification coding required to facilitate global systems applications. While much of the emphasis of European attentions to RFID focuses upon electronic product code (EPC) and associated EPC-compliant data carriers it has to be recognised that other numbering systems exist and are being promoted for global applications. The ubiquitous identification (UID) system being promoted widely within the Asia-Pacific regions of the world. There is a need to resolve the global numbering requirements and the means whereby these numbers can be freely issued, managed and maintained.<br/><br/>The European emphasis upon EPC also extends to a disproportionate attention to EPCglobal designated standards in contrast to ISO/IEC standards and promotion of the Internet of Things as an aspirational objective for RFID and alignment with the European research framework in respect of ubiquitous computing and networks. Again there is a need to identify and consider the components that distinguish a global framework for RFID regulation, standardisation and developments with respect to RFID.<br/><br/>A support action programme is proposed in which this broader framework can be recognised and used as a basis for providing a more incisive reference platform for European usage of RFID and a more informative foundation for European regulatory decisions. The team assembled for the support action benefits from involvement in two UK Government funded Global Watch missions on RFID, one to the USA and one to Japan.

Experiencing, exploring and documenting different learning and working environments in Europe to enhance intercultural skills in education and vocational training\" for students, trainees and teaching staff is on the one hand based on the fact that we have a growing range of organisational, logistic and financial opportunities to open up and discover Europe as a space for learning and on the other hand on the motivating awareness that we are life-long learners, regardless of age and status who have to move within increasingly internationalized networks. Enlarging knowledge already acquired, discovering something new and being able to look at familiar things from a different perspective and to put them into question during an exchange with people from other cultural backgrounds, these are skills which are of increasing importance in view of a rapidly changing and globalized world.\r\nThe objectives of our project are therefore:\r\n- Giving incentives to move\r\n- Sensitizing participants for different structures and approaches by taking a different point of view\r\n-  Enhancing intercultural competence by \"immersing\" in complex and different professional environments and situations\r\n-  Developing and strengthening self-confidence and empowerment by engaging in different everyday lives and working structures and by getting to know and experiencing different value systems\r\n- Enhancing perseverence and the ability to remain calm when coping with unfamiliar situations\r\n- Getting to know the languages and approaches of colleagues, business partners and customers and learning how to work and  communicate in these languages without misunderstandings\r\n- Providing learners and teaching staff with competences which enable them to adapt more easily to technological and organisational changes within complex social structures and a diverse and multilingual information society\r\n- Improving the quality and efficiency of vocational training by exploiting the plurality of learning environments both at home and abroad\r\n- Improving chances, flexibility and competitiveness - employability - of young people in different professional fields on global labour markets\r\n- Encouraging learners and teaching staff to actively \"live\" mobility and cross-border cooperation by widening their perspective and their personal and professional range beyond national borders: Feeling \"at home\" elsewhere in the world\r\n- Giving teachers the opportunity to explore the common work and learning place called Europe and to initiate and shape Europe-wide learning cooperations and networks\r\n- Enhancing the international orientation of our school and integrating it visibly into all its fields.\r\nThe participants come from different job and training backgrounds but they all have something in common: They all learn, study and work in a multicultural environment characterized by diversity.
