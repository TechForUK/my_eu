The first one will aim in creating and establishing a trustful environment for the participants in which they will have the chance to develop their social skills, relish their dynamics, inspire and get inspired by the collective work that will take place. Exercises regarding physical preparation, warming-up, stretching and muscular exercises, integration, trust and reliance activities, realization games, all based in physical, social and mental interaction; imagination awakening and energizing, boosting creativity, prompting critical thinking, development of social skills are of the prime aims during all the stages and sections of the workshop. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the second round of activities, the forum discussion will take place regarding issues strongly intertwined with the idea of the social and cultural exchange, social inclusion, critical thinking and self-confidence. The third part of the workshop is directly linked to the second round of activities as it will be formed from the ideas, the concerns and the outcome of discussions. As a form, it will be based on street performances, exercises and short-scenes structured and presented out of the participants\u2019 material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy exchanging good practices, knowledge, experiences participants realise the cultural and social similarities and differences from country to country. Through discussions and group work they identify the most prevalent social issues of the partner countries' cities and work in groups to propose ways to battle such problems. Through workshops on different forms of street performing arts the participants reflect and discuss the social impact of such performing arts on young disadvantaged people. By sharing stories, they learn more about the work but also the background of each other. On the 20th of September, a street performance is planned to take place in the city centre of Dresden next to the Elbe river where the participants will disseminate the results of the project and the local community of Dresden will have the opportunity to see an international street performance which promotes social inclusion, active participation, democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough \"Perform to Reform\" project, EU values are fostered and participants develop their key competences such as presentation, communication, creative, performing, cooperation skills, critical thinking, understanding the cultural similarities and differences among the countries involved and as a result the participants will bring and transfer the knowledge, experience and methods they acquired and learned to their local communities.

Unemployment  is one of the causes of social exclusion. For many young people unemployment implies lack of opportunities, lack of future perspectives, limited personal development, low self-esteem, the impossibility of becoming autonomous. Unemployment affects young people from a variety of backgrounds, at different times of their lives and in various circumstances. Unemployment is a social problem that everybody may face. But when it affects young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, their situation is harder due to the lack of support. Those young people become unemployed more easily and unemployment can be the starting point of a \u201cnegative snowball effect\u201d. Then, they face problems of different kinds which come together in a short period of time and/or accumulate in other ways. Our tasks as youth workers, youth leaders are to find these young people with disadvantaged background and provide them such type of youth work tools based on the youth policies of European Commission which can provide them possibilities to overcome their multi problem situations and empower them to become self \u2013 confident and employed or even self \u2013 employed European citizens. The overall aim of the seminar is to provide space for youth workers, youth leaders to understand better the background and causes of long term unemployment of young people and get familiar with youth policies made by European Commission in order to fight against that and how these youth policies can be adapted into local youth work activities by exploring and inventing new tools on positive thinking, empowering job seekers and fighting against social exclusion in local and transnational level. \u201dBecause of You(th)!\u201d  who will be the employers, staff and volunteers of the partner organisations who actively work with unemployed young people. Their target groups have multi problem situations e.g. unemployed young people from rural areas or with immigrants background or from a Roma family or having some disabilities, etc. The seminar will be based on the principles of non \u2013 formal education and aimed at using formal, informal and non \u2013 formal learning elements. Trainers will focus on to invent huge variety of methods in order to provide learning opportunities for all people having different learning styles. The methodology will be learner centre and based on the interest, needs and expectations of partner organisations and their participants. During the seminar, there will be several methods used when participants can experience being the situation of an unemployed young people in order to foster their emotional and rational understanding concerning this multi problem situation. Other role plays will provide them opportunity to try them out being in different roles of a youth worker who work with unemployed young people. Participant can try out different tools and methods in a safe environment. Some examples for methods we will use during the seminar:  individual work, pair work, small mixed group work, national group work, role plays, theatre method, making a collage, symbolize, making definitions, express a link between theory and practice, drawings, etc.  Methodological flow of the seminar: Who we are and what we will do here together? What are the background and causes of youth unemployment in general and in different countries? What are the characteristic of the multi problem situation regarding to being unemployed? What are the youth policy approaches and proposals towards youth unemployment by European Commission and how can we achieve these in our local youth work? What can be the tools locally and transnational level to break the unemployed situation? How can positive thinking be used? How can we empower the young job seekers? How can we fight against social exclusion? How transnational youth projects supported by Erasmus + programme can support young people to become employee or self \u2013 employer? Results and impact: To prepare, run and evaluate several youth activities local and transnational level by using the gained tools from the seminar which can support young job seekers to get to know themselves better, being able to identify their needs and support them finding appropriate youth work possibility locally or European level where they can improve their needed competences what can lead them towards finding or establishing a job for themselves.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2014-3-TR01-KA105-013889_6"], ["3QR", "Handi'Cap sur l'Europe", "Consilium Education and Training Ltd", 105189.0, "In 2015, a work experience or an internship abroad are valuable as a matter of fact.\r\nTherefore, the access to European mobility is limited to some people, including disable people.

The Betzavta method is used to look at how democracy works (or does not work) in a small group and provides a space of self-reflection for every individual to think of their role in a group and in the larger society. Although Betzavta is gaining increasing international popularity due to its ability to connect with a wide range of important contemporary youth work topics (e.g. democratic decision making, conflict resolution, multiculturalism), international training offers in the field are still very rare. It was also deliberately chosen to implement the project in cooperation with EECA partner region + Russia  as in most of the countries of the partner region a lack of democracy education practices can be clearly seen. A comparatively weakness of a civil society based on democratic values unfortunately still forms a characteristic of the post-soviet states and the capacity building of actors in the field with an innovative method will help to strengthen the existing initiatives in this area.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the proposed training are:\r\n* To provide youth workers and youth leaders from program and EECA partner countries with the chance to deeply reflect on their attitudes towards democracy through an experiential learning setting\r\n* To raise the competences of participants to make use of innovative methods and  tools in their work with young people in the field of democracy education and therefore to improve the democratic skills and sensitivity of young people \r\n* To form a network of like-minded organisations, which are interested in the further cooperation and exchange on innovative forms of democracy and civic education\r\n* To develop follow-up project involving young people from a variety of background in the field of democracy and civic education\r\n\r\n25 participants from 9 countries will join together in November 2015 in Aghveran, Armenia to experience this Betzavta training course.  Participants will be youth workers and youth leaders who have a strong interest in the topics of demoracy and civic education and are open for an in-depth personal reflection process.  They will be diverse in age, as well as economic opportunities, coming from different socio-economic backgrounds, both advantaged and disadvantaged ones.  \r\n\r\nThe group will go through a series of interactive and engaging activities that usually set up a short task for them to do together or in small groups, and then evaluate and reflect on their participation in that task.  The evaluation is unique to the Betzavta method, as it looks at the difference between the process and the result, as the trainers challenge the participants to find dilemmas in their behavior.  For example, a common dilemma is wanting every individual in the group to be free, but also wanting equal participation.  This encourages people to take in both sides and empathise with every person's right to participate in their own way, as well as acknowledge the consequences of this participation.  \r\n\r\nThe result, in the short and longer term, is a greater sense of responsibility that comes from the bottom-up.  Instead of being told what to do or simply following rules, participants begin to take initiative in their actions in order to create the kind of society that they want to live in.  This is because they realize that maybe they have not fully practiced what they say, and they start to look more deeply at their own practices and how this affects others.  The impact is that they are more aware of themselves, and therefore more aware of others.  As they find and know themselves, they are able to clear out the borders between 'us' and 'them' and therefore be naturally more inclusive, as a way of being, instead of a 'doing'.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-2-DK01-KA105-004380_5"], ["3QR", "Time to Act", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 16962.0, "Time to Act is a training course that aims to support the professional development of young leaders and trainers and to raise the quality of their projects on the topic of citizenship.

It is very hard nowadays to motivate young people with fewer opportunities to be part of any type of activities but it is even harder to keep them involved into it. So the main reason of our projects is to explore the techniques of cooperative learning, how it can be adapted into our local youth work realities. Cooperative learning techniques can improve transversal skills, emotional quotient, and social skills of young people with fewer opportunities through youth work activities. By youth work activities our aim is to develop the interpersonal competences of our target groups according to their needs, so having main focus on listening, respect different opinions, leadership, problem solving, conflict solving, help to each others, critical thinking, creative thinking, etc. Besides these transversal skills, it is essential to develop and improve their EQ with special focus on self-esteem, self-control, self\u2013motivation, empathy, partnership. Young people with fewer opportunities need to be supported to feel important, to make self \u2013 assessment, to get positive messages, to recognise their own values and experience to be important part of the community. During cooperative learning, they can experience and recognise how good to be a member of a diverse group, taking responsibility for each others, supporting each others, enjoying a group work, developing communication skills, to be committed, to be creative, to be motivated, etc. These skills are necessary nowadays to enter to the labour market and even to be happy and successful in our work and family lives. For that we need to find innovative and creative and useful methods which can provide appropriate support for young people in need. In order to achieve that, we, as youth workers have to develop ourselves, our youth workers\u2019 competences and learn to use and adapt useful techniques and structures for the success of our work, success of our target groups and for the success of the future of European Union. Our overall aim is to understand the meaning of cooperative learning, to explore its techniques and structures and adapt it into youth work realities based on the needs of young people with fewer opportunities. Being able to understand the different motivation factors of young people and how it can be used within youth work activities. Being able to prepare, run and evaluate youth work workshops by using techniques and structures of cooperative learning on developing social skills, communication skills, decision making skills, know \u2013 how, information skills, critical thinking, creative thinking and cooperation skills of young people with fewer opportunities.

The seminar will take place in Saint-Etienne (France) from 24th to 27th of November, 2016.The aim of this seminar is to spread, to share, to put forward discussion, and to multiply the results of an Erasmus Plus Strategic Partnership (ISSE: Initiatives for a Social and Solidarity Economy), which productions could be useful to youth work : - a research on characteristics of SSE and training needs within partner countries, with a special focus on youth and SSE- a portfolio on competencies for a common framework on youth entrepreneurship- training modules to develop SSE competencies (tested on local and European level and based on non-formal education methods)- a serious game to facilitate the understanding of the notions of competences, sense of initiative, creation on SSE projects- a network of actors sharing good practices on youth entrepreneurship within SSEThe intent is to invite the 25 participants (youth leaders, inclusion youth workers, trainers\u2026) to reflect on the developed considerations and  tools and to adopt them for themselves, in order to be able to use them on their work with young people, and to encourage the increasing of young competencies in the field of SSE.The seminar will be led according to active pedagogy principles: small group activities, simulations, debates\u2026 These 4 days should encourage participants to revisit their practices, to identify innovating methods on youth support, and to develop a common culture on SSE in Europe as input for youth entrepreneurship.Working languages will be English and French. Translators will support the communication.The team of the seminar will be composed of a participant from each partner country.The dates of the seminar have been chosen for 2 main reasons: 1/November is in France the SSE month. A large panel of initiatives is offered, specifically dedicated to young people; so it is the opportunity to develop a European dimension!2/At the end of November takes place in Saint-Etienne the event \u201cTatou Juste\u201d (on sustainable alternatives), which gathers SSE actors on \u201calternative living, consuming, working, training\u201d.

Especially in the light of the refugee crisis and the increasing religious diversification in western European states, the need for projects, which give the chance for a constructive and mutual exchange between faith groups, can be clearly seen. Concerning the EECA partner region the starting point is slightly different. Religious has often re-gained importance in several states after its harsh suppression during the Soviet Union. This growing importance however also includes the risk of a marginalization of minority religions, which members are often living in the region for several centuries.

Taking into consideration that the progress against these challenges will be intolerably slow if only 3% to 5% of EU\u2019s population consider they can solve them, we are of the opinion that this fact creates an urgent need to teach people about social entrepreneurship in order to help them to make lasting and important changes in their communities and across the EU.As one could realize during his engagement with European programs, only recently, it has been given a great emphasis by EU, on the education and training concerning social entrepreneurship. This fact could specifically be observed through Erasmus+ program and it could possibly be reflected by the idea that Europe needs more capable and eager social entrepreneurs.  For those reasons, the EU has continuously been searching for the appropriate ways to inspire the potential entrepreneurs, in order to encourage them to set up their new social enterprises.At the present time, the education of people on the applicability of entrepreneurial fields is highly necessary especially for the creation of new venture with a social orientation. The development of new small businesses which, most of the times, are accompanied by a social spirit, does not only empower the economic situation through the creation of new jobs, but it also provides solutions that enhance positive social change.Social entrepreneurship represents an innovative and effective mechanism for addressing many problems around the world, despite this fact it has only recently started to gain momentum. By increasing the scope of social entrepreneurship in a natural way, and primarily through the education of social entrepreneurship, we aim to familiarize youth workers with the new trend called \u2018social entrepreneurship\u2019, in order to be capable to assimilate the appropriate skills and tools which could potentially lead to the concrete education of the young people, on the fields associated with a construction of sustainable social enterprise.TSS project primarily aims at the education of the next generation of entrepreneurs, who are concerned with the sociological ramifications of entrepreneurship. This target will be successfully accomplished through the production of capable influential multipliers, such as civil society organizations and youth workers, who will eventually be fully-educated to educate, and therefore to exploit, the material derived from TSS project. More analytically, by the integration of a range of well-designed non-formal methods, ICT tools and educational material in the normal activities of the above-mentioned organizations, the potential social entrepreneurs will be trained to maximize their skills, thus identifying those challenges of our times which might enable them to develop solutions and models for sustainable social organizations.Whilst JuBuK members and partners have recognized the need and therefore the importance of social entrepreneurship in EU, they have altogether taken the initiative to develop a special training in Germany concerning ''The Social Start-up'' (TSS). Accordingly, the abbreviation \u2018TSS\u2019 refers to the ensemble of youth workers deriving from all the organizations which will be involved in the project and who will consequently accelerate the further development of social entrepreneurship culture across the EU. The scope of \u2018TSS\u2019 training is to provide youth workers with an insight on social entrepreneurship, which could possibly operate as the main catalyst in inspiring young people to apply social entrepreneurship.The main objectives of the project are set below:- To acquaint with the principles of \u2018social entrepreneurship\u2019.- To acquire the appropriate skills which would enable the youth workers in order to support young people to build social enterprises that address the challenges of our time.-To promote, within specific well-designed practices, the development of innovative ideas concerning sociological fields. -To share national resources and inform about European ones (social entrepreneurship education and learning, access to different types of funding, partnerships, networks etc.) useful for social enterprise creation and sustainability; -To share practical non-formal educational methods that motivate, and therefore engage young people with activities related to social entrepreneurship -To create strong partnerships, capable to develop future projects concerning social entrepreneurship and beyond.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-2-DE04-KA105-014185_10"], ["3QR", "\u201dLet\u2019s partYcipate!\u201d - Training course on rural development by active participation and European citizenship through local and international youth activities", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 16272.0, "As youth workers, youth leaders who work in rural areas we experience a vast lack on information on mobility projects for young people. In small villages, settlements, islands, remote areas the possibilities don\u2019t come so fast to the young people like in big cities or close to the capitals. Rural youth needs to be motivated and supported to participate in international youth events and encourage them to bring back their experiences and developed competences to local level in order to improve rural areas. One of our first tasks as rural youth workers, youth leaders are to develop and improve our youth work competences to make international youth work opportunities as Mobility projects for young people and youth workers according to the proposals of Erasmus + programme more visible and attractive for our target groups. Bring the information such a way for them that they can feel encouraged to participate, they can understand that participation is essential for them and for their local communities as well. Rural development can truly happen if young people participate in European level, experience being European citizen, feel to be active citizens then they can practice these in local level for the sake of their rural areas. Rural youth have to recognise that their opinion and thoughts are important to the decision makers in their rural communities, they can initiate a dialogue with youth policy makers, and they can establish youth councils to represent them, they can cooperate with youth organisations, and other civil society organisations which can support their ways of 'learning to participate' from an early age. As rural youth workers, youth leaders we would like to improve their youth work competences in order to achieve this participation level of our target groups in the sake of rural development. The overall aim of the training course is to develop understanding and awareness of youth workers, youth leaders for the impact of international youth projects to the local community in rural areas and the efficiency of the active participation of young people within international and local youth projects. To build a bridge between the gained skills and knowledge of young people in international level and for using these skills and knowledge in the sake of local community in rural areas.

In order to reach this aim, the following objectives shall be implemented: - developing key knowledge, skills and attitudes as the necessary ingredients in becoming successful and independent users of modern technologies - raising awareness of how digital tools and new media aid youth work and help to create greater impact of present day youth activities- crating space for effective transfer of know-how in regards to media literacy and digitalisation across Europe- exchanging tools, methods, idea, etc. in the use of modern technologies across youth work in Europe- fostering European cooperation in the youth field and supporting the development of new and innovative solutions for new generations of digitalised youth organisations - discovering the potential of Erasmus+ Programme as a tool for developing media literacy and thus promoting smarter growth through establishing \u2018Digital agenda for Europe.\u2019 The objectives listed above are directly linked to the Erasmus+ programme priorities, giving a possibility to not only develop key competencies, share good practices or create stronger network for the benefit of international integration, but also prepare all parties for further evolution of technology and media in the future. As such, the training course proposed is going to take the best of all three worlds of education \u2013 formal, non-formal and in-formal \u2013 for reaching the objectives and producing a feasible outcome in form of 'MELT: Media Literacy Toolbox For Educators': a living handbook with useful methods, tools and tips for everyone willing to tackle the issue of media literacy or use of e-learning in their work. The manual will be prepared jointly by the course participants as well as partner promotes engaged in the project.METHODS:The very course will focus on the development of media related and digital competences that can easily be applied by the youth organisations in promoting their activities, reaching target groups, attracting funding, etc. So as to maximise the learning and impact exerted on the course participants, the main body of knowledge shall be delivered with the extensive use of non-formal education tools. These will include: individual / pair / groups work, discussions, brainstorming, teambuilding exercises, model thinking, simulation exercises, mind mapping, input by trainers, debriefing of exercises, individual and group reflection, etc. All these will be further enriched with energisers and other shorts activities used for capturing the attention. Also, the course is expected to be practical in nature. Therefore, workshops on the use of ICT and media tools will take place as part of the daily activities. For the sake of that participants will be encouraged to bring their own laptops, tables, camera, video recorders and any other digital resources to be used. Finally, study visit to the local library has been planned. The Hive is highly renowned in the area for being digitally advanced and open to new media solutions both for the staff and the public. EXPECTED IMPACT: - increased knowledge, skills and attitudes related to the use of new media and digital tools in the local/national and international youth work activities- concrete (hard) skills in the use of media tools developed - greater awareness gained of how to implement a media rich dissemination campaign- better understanding of the benefits and dangers of (mis)using media - greater confidence gained in using media and digital tool for the sake of organisation management and personal development- improved motivation to be an active yet considerate user of media tools, etc.- international network of new media in youth work supporters created - new ideas for local and international projects developed- staff members, volunteers, trainers, etc. trained in the use of new media tools and available to apply these into the organisation, etc.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2016-1-UK01-KA105-023278_coordinator"], ["3QR", "Facilitarium 2 - art of visual facilitation of learning", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 24817.0, "-TYPE OF ACTIVITY: youth workers mobility - training course- DATES:  20-10 July 2016 - VENUE: Worcester, United Kingdom- NO. OF PARTICIPANTS and STAFF: 35- COUNTRIES ENGAGED: United Kingdom, Estonia, Austria, Poland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Lithuania, Romania,Spain, Bulgaria, Greece and Hungary.CONTEXT: The proposed project idea is based upon the concept of the similar training course on visual facilitation carried out in Estonia back in 2014. Previous project (Facilitarium - http://facilitarium2014.tumblr.com/about) turned out to be highly successful - it not only showed how important facilitation skills are in general, but also how innovative approaches (e.g. the use of visualisation techniques) can help strengthen the overall learning of the target groups as well as enhance the impact and value of educational activities in general. Experience shows that using visualisaltion techniques is becoming more and more popular in the youth sector training, information and exchange activities thanks to their innovation, simplicity and just very big slice of difference in comparison with regular digital ways. In addition to that, recent studies and researches prove that learning is becoming more individual, therefore it should meet the needs and learning styles of different participants/learners, at the same time offering them space for skills acquisition. Visual communication and facilitation certainly provide that through constant active involvement of the learners.  AIM and OBJECTIVES:With the following project we wish to propose a highly practical, hands-on training course aimed at improving the quality of communication and educational activities of youth NGOs. This will be done by means of providing their staff (e.g. trainers, facilitators, teachers, coaches, youth work practitioners, volunteers and all those engaged in conducting educational activities) with a set of tools and practices for enhanced visual facilitation. These can later be used when organising all sorts of educational and informational activities in the youth field e.g. training courses, seminars, partners meetings, study visits, exchanges, presentations, meetings etc.In order to reach the project aim, the following objectives have been set:\u2014 to explore and better understand the need for visual facilitation of learning in the youth activities nowadays (note: it is important that each of the organisations and participants engaged in the course discover the context in which VF can be used in their own everyday work)\u2014 to equip participants with the variety of tools and methods applicable in visual facilitation and mapping of educational and informational activities in the youth field\u2014 to develop practical skills in using important components of visual facilitation (e.g. shapes, colours, composition, hand-writing, visual metaphors, analysing and summing up of information\u2014 to set up the basis for further development of these skills on individual and organisational level in order to ensure the exploitation of newly gained knowledge for the benefit of NGOs and a variety of learners we work with.METHODOLOGY:The working methods of the training will include typical non-formal education methods, focused on individual and group exercises, workshops, live presentations, discussions, quests for experience and tests for skills, by which we are going to cover all the components of visual facilitation process. Most importantly, though, training course is a hands-on activity which means that project's agenda includes a lot of creative practical tasks allowing participants to reveal their talents and master facilitation skills. IMPACT:The proposed project offers a great learning and capacity building potential for participants involved, partner promoters as well as target groups we all tend to work with back home. These are typically young people, as well as occasionally children and adult learners. Here, those attending will be provided with the unique opportunity to develop a set of highly creative and by far innovative competences in visual facilitation of learning. As such, the skills and knowledge gained can be used broadly across various fields, encouraging creativity within meeting rooms, board rooms, workshops, training courses, classrooms and any other places, where visual facilitation of learning is deemed useful. This means that the effects of our joint work are likely to not only target direct partner involved but may stretch out to our local communities as well as any other work carried out by the partners at the regional, national and international level. We expect that also the proposed project will have significant impact on the participants and partner promoters, thus leading to new ideas and future projects being planned.

The mobility will gather 28 partners from the following countries: Bulgaria, United Kingdom, Romania, Macedonia, Slovakia, Turkey, Italy, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Greece, the Netherlands and Poland. CONTEXT:As keen advocates of the previous Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning Programmes as well as the current Erasmus+ Programme, we strongly believe that mobilising and involving young people in transnational projects is one of the effective tools in dealing with the possible consequence of unemployment. Though majority of the projects offered around Europe and worldwide do not create jobs themselves, precious learning gained when attending or helping to organise an activity leads to invaluable experiences. We have already seen the outcomes of that with hundreds of young people boosting their self-esteem, becoming more motivated to overcome challenges, developing resilience and even setting up their own entrepreneurial ventures (e.g. projects, start-ups, etc.).   How to ensure, however, that the projects offered to young people, particularly those unemployed ones, are truly meaningful and empowering? How to turn them into valuable lessons with learning and development (both personal and professional) in focus? And finally, how to activate those who have already lost their hopes and are reluctant to make any further steps towards the future? These and many other questions sparked up the discussion between partners and led to the following application being presented. AIM AND OBJECTIVES:The proposed Contact Making Event (with elements of a training course) is aimed at bringing together stakeholders interested in developing networks and joint future projects with the view to addressing issues of youth unemployment. We wish to achieve that by means of:- gathering 28 youth workers and project coordinators from around Europe to better understand short and long term  implications of youth unemployment - exchanging best practices in the fields of youth empowerment and supporting the development of employability skills through engagement in youth projects- developing capacities to prepare and implement high-quality, sustainable youth projects with long lasting impact at the local and international level - facilitating networking between partner promoters and development of strategies for the future joint projects aimed at unemployed young people- promoting the use of the local and international funds (e.g. Erasmus+) in supporting young people\u2019s development and combating the consequences of youth unemployment- developing ideas and strategies for the future joint projects to be carried out by the partner promoters.WORKING METHODOLOGY: CME will be based on the principles and practices of non-formal education, taking into account the needs of youth NGOs and their target groups, their motivations / expectations and previous experiences. In order to implement an effective and quality mobility, a diversity of working methods will be used, including: interactive presentations,group work, simulation exercises and role plays that involve participants directly and emotionally, multimedia use for visualisation, discussions in form of e.g. World Cafe, games and energisers, daily feedback, etc.      IMPACT:It is expect that Contact Making Event will lead to:- new, intentional friendships and professional networks developed- competences gained in the field of youth empowerment and combating youth unemployment- better knowledge of and hence preparedness to run future Erasmus+ projects- greater capacities developed to initiate and successfully implement high quality local and international projects- new and innovative youth work methods learnt - we hope that the tools and ideas taken from the workshops implemented during the CME will empower participants themselves to act as multipliers and promoters of non-formal education as a way to acquire precious life and employability skills- renewed motivation to carry on with various activates at the local and/or international level - we expect that participants themselves will be the drivers and main promoters of joint project ideas developed with fellow participants during the CME. As such, we hope to see them being engaged in the follow-up activities in forms on new projects, workshops, initiatives, etc.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2016-1-PL01-KA105-023478_10"], ["3QR", "Inter-Mediate \u2013 training course on intercultural social mediation", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 24784.0, "Social change has always been a process provoking tensions and clashes of interest.

AIM and OBJECTIVES:The main aim of the training course is to develop the capacities of youth work practitioners (youth workers, community development officers, facilitators, trainers, group leaders, mentors, etc.) in using coaching as an effective guidance, motivation and empowerment tool in building young people\u2019s resilience for the job market. This will be achieved by:-Assessing and reviewing the key youth employability issues around Europe today so as to better understand the need for a different approach of guidance and support being provided to young people accessing the jobs market.-Equipping youth work practitioners with a set of psychological coaching tools that will directly be applied within career coaching, the empowerment of young people and in the building of their resilience.  -Supporting Youth Workers to directly assess well-being of young people in order to appropriately apply the tools to the their personal and professional development.-Exchanging additional tools and best practices that the course participants will share with each other within the programme. -Supporting participants to take the learning forward beyond the programme through acting as multipliers of learning, cascading the knowledge they have gained to their organisation in their home countries and throughout other professionals in the field. -Facilitating networking opportunities between partner promoters and the development of strategies for the future joint projects aimed at youth guidance and support (especially those to be implemented within ERASMUS+). METHODS USED:So as to help achieve project objectives we shall employ a supportive coaching methodological approach. This implies workshops delivery based on the principles of non-formal education (e.g. experiential learning, theoretical and practical knowledge shared, cooperative learning, shared responsibility, personal reflection etc.). The approach will be further enriched with numerous practical examples of tools, methods, approaches as well as case studies that have brought about change and success in the subject area. As such, the approaches are highly participatory, cooperative and rather self reflective. Several learning opportunities have been predicted and designed and surely incalculable others will occur through interaction, co\u2013existence and cooperation.SAMPLE IMPACT:- Practical competences developed within the subject matters covered during the course - this relates to the knowledge of diverse working tools, skills in using these in variety of contexts, positive attitude towards using the new tools to support young people in the job market;- More resilience of the Youth Workers as they apply tools learnt to themselves and their own work contexts (directly resulting in enhanced focus and attention, better decision making, more self-awareness, greater creativity, better resilience and emotional intelligence amongst other changes);- Developed better understanding and more holistic perspective on youth unemployment and ways to tackle it;- Greater confidence and better quality of interventions applied in a wide range of contexts related to getting young people into employment;(Benefit  for partner organisations)- Having their representatives trained in coaching and building resilience - new competences developed are likely not only to be used in supporting young people, but will surely influence the way teams work back home;- Strengthened cooperation at the international level and new contacts developed (not all partners have already had the chance to work together);- New ideas for future cooperation developed, either within the topics discussed during the course or any other joint areas of interest identified;- Access to wide range of educational tools that are to improve the quality and level of support given to young people (particularly the ones seeking employment, etc.). (Impact on the young people) -  Getting more young people into employment or training (particularly those disadvantaged ones, insecure, without concrete or any educational background, etc.);- Changing young people\u2019s perspectives regarding the job search. Here: greater resilience applied, healthier perspectives developed, positive attitudes, openness to challenges and treating these as opportunities, etc.We hope to see the impact growing bigger and bigger with time and positively influencing all parties involved. Should the need arise, we will be happy to continue supporting project participants and their organisations by developing follow-up workshops (e.g. in form of new mobilities, webinars, tutorials, 1-2-1 coaching sessions, etc.).", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2016-2-UK01-KA105-024811_coordinator"], ["2HR", "BirdLife Malta - Conservation Volunteering", "EIL LTD", 56862.0, "As an eNGO our main aim is to work towards protecting birds and their habitats.

In order to contribute to the prevention of violence against women, this project is planned by WRAP, an informal group gathered to deal with the problems of women. Based on the idea that the problem of violence against women can be solved just by the revolution of mentality, the project intends to let participants reach new horizons by means of exchanging ideas and best practices on prevention of violence against women. Accordingly, the project aims to raise the awareness of youth workers about the importance of this issue and equip them with necessary competences to prevent all forms of violence against women through relevant good practices.For this purpose, this project brings together 28 youth workers from youth organizations working on violence against women for a study visit to be organised in Ankara, Turkey between 9 and 14 October 2016. The participating youth workers from Bulgaria, Croatia, Jordan, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the UK are already engaged in various activities related to the topic, and they are willing to actively use and disseminate the outputs of the project.

Hence, we have designed a practical KA1 youth workers mobility (Training Course) \u201cAnimate to Participate\u201d. The project's main aim is to develop capacities of youth organisations in the use of animations as the innovative, non-formal education, dissemination and empowerment tool. In order to achieve that, the following objectives shall be implemented step by step:\r\n\r\n- analysing the importance of animation in information sharing and assessing its application in the youth field\r\n- bringing together youth work practitioners and training them in the basics of animation techniques \r\n- discovering the potential of the available ICT and media tools in launching, testing and implementation of animation in the youth field \r\n- increasing partner promoters capacity to provide creative and innovative solutions to ensure greater visibility and dissemination of our everyday work  \r\n- through the use of animations > fostering active participation and development of key competences for the benefit of members and service users of our organisations\r\n - exchanging best practices as well as providing space for networking and development of future project ideas based on the creative forms of expression (e.g. animations).\r\n \r\n\r\n- WORKING METHODS: \r\n\r\nTraining course will see the application of traditional non-formal educational methods, including: name games, energisers and teambuilding exercises; presentations (both online and offline); one-to-one and group work;  discussions e.g. round table, brainstorming, etc.; networking and exchange of best practices; reflection time; learning by doing, etc.\r\n\r\n- IMPACT:\r\n\r\n* Participant level\r\n- increased knowledge, skills and attitudes related to the use of animations and digital tools in the local/national and international youth work activities\r\n- concrete (hard) skills developed in the use of animations (stop motion technique)\r\n- greater awareness gained of how to use animations as part of DEOR activities or in educational context (e.g. when creating animated content) \r\n- improved motivation to be an active yet considerate user of ICT tools\r\n- improved confidence and belief in one\u2019s own creative and innovative potential.\r\nAll these will be complemented by:\r\n- new international friendships developed\r\n- increased motivation to use newly gained competences back at home when working with the sending organisations as well as youth and community groups\r\n- eagerness to engage in further ERAMSU+ partnerships aimed at giving upskilling and giving voice (e.g. through creative forms of expression) to those who need it. \r\n\r\n* Organisational level \r\n- staff members, volunteers, trainers, etc. trained in the field of animations   \r\n- creative and innovative ideas developed for the sake of promoting organisations, creating more engaging educational tools, providing bridge for the community work (all these can be granted through the application of animations)\r\n- new international contacts developed (not all partner promoters have yet worked together!)\r\n- new ideas for local and international projects developed.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA105-035636_coordinator"], ["3QR", "See, Draw, Learn:\u00a0training course on visual facilitation of the learning process", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 16873.0, "-TYPE OF ACTIVITY: youth workers mobility - training course\r\n- DATES:  22-30 Sept 2017\r\n- VENUE: Nowy Sacz, Poland\r\n- NO. OF PARTICIPANTS and STAFF: 30\r\n- COUNTRIES ENGAGED: Poland, United Kingdom, Estonia, Romania, Greece, Latvia, Slovakia, Croatia, Austria, Norway, Czech Republic and Turkey.\r\n\r\nCONTEXT: \r\n\r\nThe proposed project idea is based on the concept of the similar course on visual facilitation carried out in Estonia in 2014. Previous project (Facilitarium) turned out to be highly successful - it not only showed how important  facilitations skills are in general, but also how innovative approaches (e.g. the use of visualisation techniques) can help strengthen the overall learning of the target groups as well as enhance the impact and value of educational activities. \r\n\r\nThe main theme of the training is addressing visual tools as an approach to enhanced facilitation of educational and informational activities organised by NGOs and individuals active in the youth field. Visual does not refer here to graphic means only (although graphic component is usually the biggest), but it also encompasses any other tools which allow to communicate ideas and information visually through diverse means e.g. paper-cutting and folding, collages, different 3d shapes, digital presentations etc.\r\n\r\nAIM and OBJECTIVES:\r\n\r\nThe following KA1 project is based on implementation of a highly practical, hands-on training course aimed at improving the quality of communication and educational activities of youth NGOs by means of providing their staff (e.g. trainers, facilitators, teachers, coaches, youth work practitioners, volunteers and all those engaged in conducting educational activities) with a set of tools and practices for enhanced visual facilitation. These can later be used when organising all sorts of educational and informational activities in the youth field e.g. training courses, seminars, partners meetings, study visits, exchanges, presentations, meetings etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the project aim, the following objectives have been set:\r\n\r\n\u2014 to explore and better understand the need for visual facilitation of learning in the youth activities nowadays (note: it is important that each of the organisations and participants engaged in the course discover the context in which VF can be used in their own everyday work);  \r\n\u2014 to bring together 30 practicing facilitators with lack of or low visual presentation skills and newcomers in the training and facilitation field so as to explore the benefits of visual facilitation;\r\n\u2014 to explore and learn the variety of tools and methods applicable for visual facilitation and mapping of educational and informational activities in the youth field;\r\n\u2014 to develop participants\u2019 skills in using important components of visual facilitation: shapes, colours, composition, hand-writing, paper-fold and -cut techniques, visual metaphors, analysing and summing up of information;\r\n\u2014 to set up the basis for further development of these skills on individual and organisational level in order ensure the exploitation of newly gained knowledge for the benefits of NGOs and a variety of learners we work with;\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\n\r\nThe working methods of the training will include typical non-formal education methods, focused on individual and group exercises, workshops, live presentations, discussions, quests for experience and tests for skills, by which we are going to cover all the components of visual facilitation process. Most importantly, though, training course is a hands-on activity which means that project's agenda includes a lot of creative practical tasks allowing participants to reveal their talents and master facilitation skills. \r\n\r\nIMPACT:\r\n\r\nThe proposed project offers a great learning and capacity building potential for participants involved, partner promoters as well as target groups we all tend to work with back home. These are typically young people, as well as occasionally children and adult learners. Here, those attending will be provided with the unique opportunity to develop a set of highly creative and by far innovative competences in visual facilitation of learning. As such, the skills and knowledge gained can be used broadly across various fields, encouraging creativity within meeting rooms, board rooms, workshops, training courses, classrooms and any other places, where visual facilitation of learning is deemed useful. This means that the effects of our joint work are likely to not only target direct partner involved but may stretch out to our local communities as well as any other work carried out by the partners at the regional, national and international level. \r\n\r\nWe expect that also the proposed project will have significant impact on the participants and partner promoters, thus leading to new ideas and future projects being planned. Here, the process of taking next steps after the project shall be skilfully facilitated and will be incorporated in the training course daily timetable.", "http://www.consiliumdt.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2017-1-PL01-KA105-037395_4"], ["3QR", "Agro-entrepreneurship Accelerator", "CONSILIUM DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING LTD", 22622.0, "Agriculture is one of the most important socio-economic activities in many of the countries of European South and a key sector for the development and sustainability of rural areas. During the last decades of the severe economic crises, rural villages have been suffering a dramatic depopulation, thus also encountering difficulties such as, for instance, territorial imbalances and lack of generational relief. As a result, unemployment in rural areas has mainly affected services and agriculture. \r\n\r\nA prosperous agricultural sector can only be developed with the involvement of young people: our aging agricultural community needs \u2018new blood\u2019 to make the sector more dynamic and open to the on-going technological transformations. However, young people, young farmers and other new entrants face considerable obstacles activity -among them societal ones- in starting up farming, while the situation is hampered by the prevailing perception that farming constitutes an unattractive or old-fashioned occupation, sometimes with inappropriate social protection.\r\n\r\nOne of the objectives of EU till 2020 is the reinforcement of agriculture and simultaneously the enhancement of young farmers, by providing them the essential know-how that will enable them to get into the entrepreneurship sector. Based on such rationale, \u2018Agro-entrepreneurship Accelerator\u2019 comes to complete this boost by providing youth workers with all the information needed in order to support young people to enter the world of agro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of the project is the implementation of an Agro-entrepreneurship training, which will constitute the distillate of the participating organizations\u2019 contribution. Inasmuch all the partners have been recognized for the vital role of agriculture education in relation to young people, they have decided to establish an innovative, specialized international training. This training will enable youth workers to gain theoretical and practical knowledge in the field of agriculture. Hence, the fundamental aim of the training is the provision of a contemporary pedagogical material appealing to youth workers, which will consequently operate as the main catalyst in inspiring young people to apply agro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n\u2018Agro-entrepreneurship accelerator\u2019 will not only enrich youth workers knowledge concerning the field but it is also seeking to contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment by boosting rural and regional economy through the creation of new agribusinesses, or the involvement of a greater percentage of young people in the agricultural sector. More specifically, the amplification of education in combination with the creation of an unprecedented strong networking amongst youth workers with strong interest in the sector of agriculture, will definitely help to refresh the economic activities in rural areas, thus aiming to regional development, a fact that provides an additional quality and an added value to the project. \r\n\r\nTo conclude with, \u2018Agro-entrepreneurship accelerator\u2019 project aims at the education of the next generation of entrepreneurs who are concerned with the agricultural ramifications of entrepreneurship. This target will be successfully accomplished through the production of capable influential multipliers, such as civil society organizations and youth workers who will eventually be fully-educated to educate, and therefore to exploit the material derived from the project. More analytically, by the integration of a range of well-designed non-formal methods, ICT tools and educational material in the normal activities of the above-mentioned organizations, the potential agro-entrepreneurs will be trained by youth workers to maximize both their entrepreneurial skills and the agricultural know-how, thus identifying those challenges of our times which might enable them to develop solutions and models for sustainable agro-businesses.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of the training as they result from the specially-developed workshop:\r\n\r\n- The provision of NFE tools to youth workers/leaders  in order to spread awareness about agricultural entrepreneurship; \r\n- The development of specific competences in planning/executing NFE activities targeted at young people, with a focus on youth in rural areas; \r\n- The development of entrepreneurial skills aimed at supporting the growth of a new generation of agricultural entrepreneurs; \r\n- The reinforcement of youth involvement in agriculture; \r\n- To generate a new network, capable to develop knowledge based strategic partnerships concerning agro-entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe international training course \u2018Agro-entrepreneurship Accelerator\u2019 will be hosted in Larnaca by \u2018CIP\u2019 from 20 to 26/11/2018 in cooperation with partner organizations from the following 16 countries: Germany, Greece, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, Romania, Bulgaria, UK and Spain.

There is a strong motivation for further improvement within the sector and there are a lot of significant efforts being done throughout Europe, on national, regional  and local  level, to enhance the quality and recognition of youth work. We believe that youth work can be better recognised by measuring its real impact and effects on young people's lives. Often, youth organisations focus on the quantitative and not on the qualitative outputs. In order though to ensure the credibility and the real value of youth work, a well developed quality assurance framework is needed. \r\n\r\n For this reason, the training course \"LevelUp!\" aims to gather youth workers, youth policy makers, youth educators and youth leaders in order to work through the exchange of best practices, experiences and expertise on the development of a common quality assurance framework that addresses certain needs of young people that have been identified in all the partner countries involved. They will then work in groups in order to adapt this framework to the real needs of the young people of their communities. Furthermore, new innovative digital and online tools will be shared and tested regarding the validation and recognition of youth work. \r\n\r\nWorking closely with youth organizations from different countries in Europe is an important objective of this training course so that a strong international network is built.

After the completion of the first activity in Thessaloniki, the partners and participants will provide their feedback on the effectiveness of the quality assurance framework and the digital tools for the validation of youth work through an evaluation system developed by JKPeV. Being based on their feedback and evaluation we will work further and develop the quality assurance framework and the online validation tools of youth work together in Dresden, Germany in November 2018. By running two activities instead of one, we will be able to disseminate better the results of our work, test these outputs and work further on improving them. The training course is designed for youth workers who are directly involved working with Erasmus+ projects.  We are going to develop a common quality assurance framework for youth work that aims to develop the quality of youth work and its impact on young people's lives. We trust that this training course will contribute to improving quality of Erasmus+ projects and development of competent youth and community workers internationally.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to explore the concepts and benefits of working on the quality of youth work by analysing and mapping the needs of young people from different communities, to use and test innovative online tools that validate youth work and to build a strong international network of youth organisations that aim to improve quality in youth work and their youth projects at local and European level. The participants and their organisations as a result:\r\n\u2022 will know how to define youth work and its role at local and European level;  \r\n\u2022 will learn why quality in youth work is so important in international youth and community work; \r\n\u2022 will share good practices and successful examples of quality in European youth and community projects;\r\n\u2022 will develop different tools and methodology for addressing issues of quality in youth work;\r\n\u2022 will develop a common quality assurance framework that aims to improve the quality of youth works and targeted projects' impact;\r\n\u2022 will use and test innovative online tools that validate youth work;\r\n\u2022 will build their international network so that new partnerships will be developed throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe training programme consists of 6 different types of activities:\r\n1.

Discrimination, violence and racism are everywhere prevalent \u2013 bullying in schools, hate speech and hate crime against migrants, refugees, minorities, vulnerable groups and LGBTs, racist insults against people who seem to be \"different\" as well as sexual harassment. Civil courage essentially describes two things: a persons courage to speak out in the public sphere, and readiness to stand up and help their fellow citizens in time of need. One's ability to judge and act upon civil courage comes when one clearly senses injustice. The training course \"Everyday Heroes\" aims to empower 33 youth workers, youth leaders and educators from Albania, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and United Kingdom to develop ways to combat hate speech, and strengthen support for human rights through non-formal education and awareness-raising actions from 12 to 18 November 2018 in Dresden, Germany. According to Mark Albon, head of Countering Violent Extremism at the Commonwealth Secretariat \u201cHate and intolerance are the currency of violent extremism. We must make it \u2018our common cause\u2019 to offer strong alternative narratives that emphasise people\u2019s fundamental human rights, build inclusivity in our societies and diminish the efforts of those who would seek to sow division and discord across the world.\u201d \r\nThe main aim of the training course \"Everyday Heroes\" is the promotion of civil courage based on democratic values.\r\nTo reach this overarching aim, five intermediary objectives are defined:\r\n- Raising the participants\u2019 awareness about democratic values\r\n- Developing social and cognitive skills\r\n- Strengthening self-efficacy of the participants\r\n- Encouraging personal responsibility\r\n- Building self-esteem and self-confidence\r\nThe training course raises the participants\u2019 awareness regarding the need for civil-courage in their daily life. The participants will learn how to take action and defend principles of justice, fairness and morality as well as to speak up in situations marked by injustice and racist discrimination. The participants will learn how to stand up for their opinions and rights and understand that silence is not a solution.\r\nThe training course includes the following pedagogical guidelines:\r\n- Enabling self-determined and holistic learning processes through non-formal learning methods and theatre techniques such as Forum Theatre and the Theatre of the Oppressed\r\n- Discussions, team-building activities, group work, simulation games, role playing and plenary sessions based on the interests and personal experiences of the participants\r\n- Opening-up experimental fields instead of judging the behavior and the actions of the participants\r\n- Using performative and visual arts as well as digital media as tools to encourage dialogue and cultural interaction as well as to work on the design of campaigns against Hate Speech\r\nThe methodology of the training course is based on theoretical inputs, action-promoting simulation games and interactive exercises. The learning content offers numerous opportunities to reflect on one's own actions and to exchange ideas with the other group members. The training course offers on the one hand basics about moral courage, different factors and forms of violence and hate and the causes of missing help behavior. On the other hand, learning situations are provided, in which reality is simulated, and a comprehension of feelings and experiences through the simulation games can be realised. Each of the participants will be actively involved and will be encouraged to recreate occasions for civil courage and options for action. To be able to tailor the training course to the needs of the group, the expectations and fears are queried at the beginning and integrated into the content. The training course will be concluded by an evaluation, but also during each training day, phases of reflection and discussion are planned. \r\nIt is aspired that the participants will learn how to stand-up and take action in situations where hate, violence, discrimination and racism are observed and that after this training course the youth workers and youth leaders and educators will transfer their knowledge and skills to the young people of their local communities so that a multiplier effect is achieved. An online guidebook about civil courage will be published and will be available on the website of Jugend- & Kulturprojekt e.V. and its facebook page which will include a variety of methods and techniques in order to promote civil courage in non-formal education.
