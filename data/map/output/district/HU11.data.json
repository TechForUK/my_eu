This is in order to guarantee a high quality offer adapted to the learning needs of the younger generations, also according to the dynamics related to the management of SEN students and the multicultural classes determined by the massive phenomenon of immigration. \r\nFor this purpose, it is vital for the current staff in the school to acquire strong and structured skills that can enable and support a real process of innovation.\r\nThe idea that supports the project is to implement job-shadowing activities in four educational institutions that embody an innovative idea of education and training:  the Rastaalan koulu in Espoo (Finland), the St Mary's College in Hull (city of culture 2017; UK), the Institut Cami de Mar in Calafell (Spain) and the Institution Saint Joseph in Le Havre (France).\r\nGetting in touch with advanced European school organizations and their operating realities will allow the team of the I.C. Fiuggi-Acuto to: \r\n-Test new organizational and educational models; \r\n- Aim at the qualification of professional skills through direct observation, practice, exchange and face-to-face comparison \r\n- Directone's work to a policy of internationalization in the perspective of a European development, making use of the collaboration with qualified individuals and systems.\r\nThe experiences of job shadowing will be undoubtedly significant in achieving the following objectives:\r\n-Acquiring new methodological and educational skills;\r\n-Acquiring new organizational and management skills;\r\n-Increasing the determination to face new challenges;\r\n-Improving the ability to promote and support innovation;\r\n-Upgrading the ability to internationalize the curricula and the educational paths;\r\n-Integrating the Institute into a circuit of modernity and a European development plan;\r\n-Strengthening of the ICT Skills\r\nEight members of the school staff will join every single mobility experience. However, members are expected to give detailed feedback, to spread the results and to share the experiences so that all stakeholders can benefit from them.\r\nParticipants in the job shadowing experiences will be chosen with a fair and transparent selection system; therefore, they will have to meet the following requirements:\r\n- Motivation to participate in the ongoing innovation processes;\r\n- Knowledge and experience of alternative teaching practices compared to traditional teaching (flipped classroom, cooperative learning, etc.)\r\n- Good knowledge of the technologies;\r\n- Good knowledge of the English language;\r\n- Interpersonal skills;\r\n-planning skills.\r\nFor every job shadowing experience, the activity plan provides:\r\n - A preparation phase that includes: 1) actions for preliminary knowledge of the hosting schools, 2) initiatives on mutual discussion and opinion exchange through digital tools, 3) preparatory actions of the mobility group, 4) drafting of the program and the timeline of each mobility, 5) preparation of the material for documentation and experience evaluation. \r\n- An action phase that includes: 1) the realization of the four job shadowing experiences according to defined program and timing;\r\n 2) Filling out the material for reports, feedbacks and experiences dissemination; \r\n3) Carrying out actions aimed at encouraging general involvement and stimulating motivation for innovation (within the school staff; \r\n4) Carrying out initiatives involving both local and non-local stakeholders; \r\n5) Revision of the curricula and the educational paths, offers and Syllabi;\r\n6) the experimentation of new methodological - didactic models.\r\n-a verification/evaluation /review Phase that includes: \r\n1) An ex post analysis and shared reflections on the experiences undertaken; \r\n2) The assembling of an evaluation report, \r\n3) Collecting and processing data for estimating the impact; \r\n4) Analyzation of the problems and identification of possible improvements (to the project) in the perspective of future replicability.\r\nThe expected impact concerns the ability to promote, support and manage innovation in its main aspects: 1) in the spatial and temporal organization of learning environments, 2)  in the flexible organization of students\u2019 groups, 3) in managing multiculturalism, 4) in using new learning methodologies and strategies, 5) in the widespread use of ICT.\r\nThe desired feedback is therefore a forward movement in the direction of innovation that affects the attitudes and skills of teachers and, consequently, the internationalization of the system and the educational success of all the students.", "http://www.smchull.org", null, "erasmus_2018-1-IT02-KA101-047513_4"]]}}, "outwardCode": "HU11"}
