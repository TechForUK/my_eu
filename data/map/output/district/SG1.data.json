In fact, Treg numbers and function predict rates of disease progression and survival. Low-dose interleukin-2 (ld IL-2) safely and specifically increases and activates Tregs in conditions such as type 1 diabetes, HBc-vasculitis and chronic graft-versus-host disease, so ld IL-2 has the potential to significantly improve survival and deliver a therapeutic breakthrough in ALS.

With the experience and results gained from the NEOShield project we are now very well equipped to address all aspects of this call, including the development of a European strategy for future research and mission-related endeavours. Our work packages are integrated into a coherent programme of research and development. Building on NEOShield experience we will further develop our GNC systems to allow increased targeting accuracy and relative velocity of a kinetic impactor spacecraft into a small (e.g. 100-300m diameter) asteroid, develop autonomous spacecraft control systems to facilitate navigation close to a low-gravity, irregularly shaped asteroid, demonstrate techniques for precise NEO orbit determination, and develop mechanisms for the collection of material samples. We will carry out astronomical observations of NEOs to improve our understanding of their physical properties, concentrating on the smaller sizes of most concern for mitigation purposes, and to identify further objects suitable for missions for physical characterisation, and NEO deflection demonstration. On the scientific front, our statistical analyses of recently published NEO survey data have been very successful: we will explore the promising avenues that have opened up during our NEOShield research. We will also perform detailed analyses of relevant individual objects (e.g. potentially hazardous objects) on the basis of published data from different observing techniques (radar, infrared, spectroscopy, etc.), in addition to new data obtained.

The competition is increasing in this area both for the full launching systems and the key subsystems. Cost-effectiveness becomes the main driving factor.\nHYPROGEO ambition is to study a propulsion module based on Hybrid chemical propulsion. Hybrid propulsion is not a new technology but its application to a transfer module or to a re-ignitable upper stage is very innovative. It is an interesting alternative for the GEO transfer, between the chemical propulsion (bi-liquid) and the new trend of Electrical Propulsion (EP).  There are very good synergies and complementarities with the other propulsion activities.\nThe proof of concept (specific impulse, thrust) has been demonstrated. The main technical challenge is the long duration firings. The future development of an operational system, already identified in the current roadmaps, requires advanced R&D work on 4 critical technologies:\n- Combustion chamber.\n- High endurance nozzle.\n- Catalytic injector.\n- Production, storage and use of high concentration hydrogen peroxide.\n\nThese R&D activities structure 4 main work packages. A system study ensures the global vision in coherence with an economic analysis, the identification of technical challenges and the consolidation of scientific results. A last work package performs the dissemination of results.\nAn innovative aspect is the fact that the R&D activities are directly driven by the ecvolution of market needs and system requirements.\nMain expected benefits are:\n- Green and simpler design (compared to bi-liquid).\n- Shorter transfer time and reduced cost of operations (compared to EP)\n\nA TRL 3-4 level is expected at the end of the project.\nThe impact of the project is secured by the composition of the consortium led by Astrium with the main European actors of the hybrid: it contributes to the consolidation of the European industrial supply chain for Hybrid propulsion.\nProject duration is 36 months.", 87306.0, 2414635.0, "HYPROGEO", null, null, null, null, "http://www.astrium.eads.net", null, "h2020_193294_999530778"]]}, "fts": {"columns": ["inwardCode", "beneficiary", "amount", "budgetLineNameAndNumber", "myEuId", "year"], "data": [["2AN", "AEROFLEX LIMITED", 442941.0, "Leadership in information and communications technology (09.04.02.01)", "fts_2017_3744", 2017], ["4QR", "CONTOUR FINE TOOLING LIMITED", 97683.0, "Appropriations accruing from contributions from (non-European Economic Area) third parties to research and technological development (2014 to 2020) (08.02.50.01)", "fts_2017_9048", 2017], ["4QR", "CONTOUR FINE TOOLING LIMITED", 9308.0, "Leadership in nanotechnologies, advanced materials, laser technology, biotechnology and advanced manufacturing and processing (08.02.02.01)", "fts_2017_32008", 2017]]}}, "outwardCode": "SG1"}
