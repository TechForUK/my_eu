An ever-growing number of organizations are adopting a model of social business, making active use of social media to communicate and engage with key stakeholders. The new social business mindset is redefining many aspects of organizational operations, including how organizations perceive knowledge management. A new, social model of knowledge management (social KM) is becoming increasingly prevalent. Focus is increasingly shifting away from how to best capture and allow access to knowledge, into how to enable knowledge-generating interactions between individuals in the most effective way. In parallel, cloud computing presents new opportunities for developing and provisioning organizational support systems which are always available and facilitate economies of scale.\n\nIn line with these developments, KnowHow aims to demonstrate a novel Knowledge Management Platform as a Service (KM-PaaS) environment for social business applications, and to prepare the ground for its commercial exploitation.\n\nThe four main objectives of the KnowHow project are:\n1. To analyze the social business market environment and to assess the commercialization opportunities for a novel KM-PaaS offering.\n2. To carry out scale-up activities critical to achieve industrial-grade strength for the KnowHow KM-PaaS, and to implement four new technological solutions based on the platform.\n3. To validate the KnowHow KM-PaaS through trials in the domains of collaborative innovation, social enterprise, supply chain networking, and social media marketing.\n4. To develop business plans and marketing strategies supporting the participating SMEs in commercializing the KnowHow KM-PaaS and the results of the trials.\n\nThe KnowHow consortium consists of 5 partners from 4 EU member states: Germany, Greece, United Kingdom, and Italy.", 247981.0, 2068602.0, "KNOWHOW", "Revolutionising social knowledge approaches", "With speed and complexity rising considerably and work settings transforming continuously, the use of social web technology is vital for small and medium-sized companies (SMEs). An EU initiative is proposing innovative social knowledge management (KM) solutions to meet the demands of SMEs.", "The emergent nature of KM and the use of social media as an adaptive tool in managing knowledge come with an added cost for small knowledge-intensive European companies. New trends in identifying, storing, sharing and creating knowledge to solve problems and make decisions all generate an avalanche of data. This may lead to information overload and wasted time for SMEs.\n\nFunded by the EU, the 'Demonstrating a cloud-based knowledge management platform for social business' (http://www.knowhow-project.eu (KNOWHOW)) project is addressing the growing intricacy and perplexity of social information and knowledge flows in SMEs dealing with rapidly changing environments.\n\nThe project team used the prototype developed during the ORGANIK project in 2010 as a starting point. This innovative KM platform employed Web\u00a02.0 to generate, share and refine organisational knowledge.\n\nResearchers are validating and demonstrating the prototype with the aim to develop a cloud-based KM platform for use in social business solutions.\n\nBy introducing cloud computing to the platform's application domains \u2014 collaborative innovation, social enterprise, supply chain networking and social media marketing \u2014 researchers will be able to offer the four components as a separate service. This method will boost the competitive advantage of SMEs.\n\nThe partners intend to prove the marketability of the scaled-up platform before proceeding with its commercialisation.\n\nKNOWHOW is introducing an innovative social model of KM.

IGIT can be used to change existing game objects and to insert additional objects on demand. For example, Player face can be customized, billboards can be added, and area on the screen can be allocated for user information. The technology does not require any change to the game code. By implementing the technology on multiple games it is possible to create a community that is not limited to a specific game or publisher and can be extended to share any information between the users in real time.<br/>(2) Current MMOG architectures rely on the idea that central servers are responsible for hosting all the items needed and shared during a game.The New Community Project proposes to integrate a P2P overlay into an existing MMOG architecture to stream user-generated content (3D animated objects, video) from one user to other user or from one user to many users. This traffic represents a real challenge to the network being already occupied by the MMOG client server data.The project intends to research and develop new techniques for P2P 3D/Video streaming that are 'friendly' to the MMOG client server communication.", 203825.0, 3226052.0, "CNG", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_94328_992946030"], ["3WN", "GROW Observatory", "Storythings Ltd", "The GROW Observatory (GROW) will create a sustainable citizen platform and community to generate, share and utilise information on land, soil and water resource at a resolution hitherto not previously considered. The vision is to underpin smart and sustainable custodianship of land and soil, whilst meeting the demands of food production, and to answer a long-standing challenge for space science, namely the validation of soil moisture detection from satellites. GROW is highly innovative project leveraging and combining low cost consumer sensing technology, a simple soil test and a large user base of growers and plant enthusiasts to contribute individual soil and land data. It is designed to engage primarily individual growers and small-scale farmers across Europe, and to enable them to develop new wisdom and innovative practices through the collective power of shared and open data and knowledge. Citizens contributing data will gain access to the first single-source comprehensive crop and watering advice service for individual and small-scale growers incorporating scientific and crowdsourced information. Moreover, they will develop \u2018campaigns\u2019 (coordinated sampling operations) around local needs and issues, to underpin smarter decision-making and implementation of policy objectives. GROW will actively identify and enable new and credible social and business innovation processes, creating potential new services, applications and markets. The outcome will be a central hub of open knowledge and data created and maintained by growers that will be of value to the citizens themselves as well as specialist communities in science, policy and industry.
