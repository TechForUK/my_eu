Consequently, if would be beneficial for Early Years staff to attend an Immersion Training Course in France where they would receive intensive professional support  and training in the speaking and teaching of French. As a result they will be more able to deliver the language to the children, recognising the importance of introducing languages at an early age which is likely to benefit other aspects of their development.\r\nStaff would also have the ability to liaise with the middle and upper staff at the school, share resources and methodology and all school staff would then be in a position to support each other, with the teaching of language within the school, embedded in the School Development plan. The benefits of this will be that the children in the school will have a wider knowledge of France, its culture and language and be better prepared for continuing the language in Secondary School.  The potential long term benefits would mean that they will also be better prepared for careers globally. By being involved with this project, the school will be in a position to build ICT links with schools in France as well as in the United Kingdom.  It is anticipated that the school will hold information events for parents and the wider community to showcase the learning that will be happening within the school.", null, "Carrbridge Primary School", "erasmus_2017-1-UK01-KA101-035798_coordinator"]]}}, "outwardCode": "PH23"}
