Our clientele is international therefore our employees should become accordingly inter-culturally capable and the company should become internationalised. Internationalisation is a central task in the field of organisational and personnel development in Volkshochschule, particularly within the next few years. The essential requirements are as follows:1. It is our goal to make sure that every adult has the opportunity to receive a quality and affordable education. This would allow us to advise and assist a more international clientele far better than in the past. The aim is to gain an improvement of communicative language skills at all levels (management, pedagogical planners and administrators, as well as teachers) within the institution.2. We would like to promote equal opportunities through our programs and its subsequent implementation. This can only be achieved through the proper design of courses to be offered by the organisation. The Volkshochschule is an institute visited by those who have almost no knowledge of the German language. Migrants, especially those who are seeking asylum,  can only be sufficiently supported through the presence of effective communication channels. This assistance is only through the use of English-a common language among many-possible. Therefore, these programs are increasingly in demand by the administration and management staff, pedagogical staff, and also those who teach German as a foreign language.3. We want the efficiency and quality of our services to improve education and training. This means in particular, the needs to use the new teaching methods and materials to improve language skills including the inclusion of new standards of testing relevant across Europe. We must expand upon the current narrow language learning and educational opportunities; this may be assisted by using English as an additional connecting language.Number and Profile of Participants and Description of Activities: Appropriate training courses are offered in the United Kingdom for these different target audiences. A total of 28 mobilities will be conducted and evaluated. The main focus is to improve the communicative language skills and increase the quality of teaching English as a foreign language for the language teachers involved.

Our clientele is becoming more international and correspondingly our personnel and the institution in general will have to become more international and capable of operating more inter-culturally. Internationalisation will be a key focus regarding organisational and staff development in the VHS in the next few years. The main requirements are becoming manifest.1. It\u2019s our target to ensure that every adult has the opportunity to enjoy life-long learning being able to attend high-quality and reasonably-priced courses. For this we have to improve the way we attract, cater for and advise a much more international clientele than before. This can only be achieved by improving active and passive language competence at all levels (management, pedagogical planers, administrative staff and also the teaching staff) of the institution.  2. Through our educational programme and its implementation we seek to promote equal opportunities. To this aim we have to make the organization of teaching and learning more easily accessible. We have to be able to reach refugees in particular and people with a migration background who initially do not speak German via the bridge language English and to a lesser extent French, in order even to be able to communicate and give meaningful guidance. Particularly administrative and pedagogical staff, the management and the DaF teaching staff at the VHS have requirements in this area.3. We seek to improve the efficiency and quality of our education and training programme. This means getting to know new teaching methods and tools, improving linguistic skills, looking in depth at the new standards of competence certification which have relevance all over Europe. We have to experiment with educational programmes which go beyond pure language training, which are taught in English or French or where English or French is used to assist as the bridge language.Number and profile of the participants and description of activities:Customized training courses will be offered in the UK and to a lesser extent in France for the various target groups mentioned above. A total of 154 mobilities will be conducted and evaluated. The main focus will be both to improve active and passive language skills and to improve the quality of teaching in the above-mentioned languages for the sub target group of language teachers involved. Moreover participants will gain an insight into the organisation and standards of the partners in the target countries thus boosting the capacity for innovation at the VHS.Procedures for implementing the project:The training project \u201cThe Challenge of Internationalisation at Volkshochschulen\u201d for the consortium from Upper Bavaria will be advertised at the participating institutions. Suitable participants will be invited to apply or can apply themselves. This includes all full and part-time employees as well as VHS teachers of English, French and German as a Foreign Language (DaF)After selection participants are committed to taking part and have intensive preparation. The key topics will be discussed with the partners and the procedure of running the training courses clarified. If necessary training courses will be scheduled. VHS staff will register the participants and book their travel. The training measures will be evaluated by the participants, by the institution responsible and by the management of the partner of the consortium. The results will be communicated within the consortium, but also to the Bavarian Volkshochschulen, the \u201cLandesverband der Volkshochschulen\u201d in Bavaria and on federal level. The responsible project manager will be the applicant for this project.Description of the envisaged results and impact and the expected long-term benefits:The staff at the Volkshochschulen taking part should become significantly more willing and able to communicate in the bridge language of English or French. Thus we will become more sensitive towards learners at the VHS who have a migration background at the first-contact stage, being able to give them better guidance and to invite them to take part in training courses and in the process of life-long learning.

We hope to achieve the following with our project: 1. an increase in the quality of teaching; 2. the establishment of international partnerships; and 3. the development of a sustainable welcome culture and the strengthening of interculturality. The training courses are adapted to the needs of the participants. Training content and objectives are aimed at different status groups and serve different purposes:\r\n\r\n1. In order to increase the quality of teaching, our teachers will examine current learning and teaching methods, foreign language didactics/special needs education, as well as innovative approaches, such as theatre pedagogy, or technology-focused learning. At the same time, the active and passive language skills will be improved.  Individual teachers will also be trained in bilingual subject teaching. \r\n\r\n2. In order to establish international partnerships, our employees (administration, social pedagogues, etc.) will attend General English and Business English courses. This will improve their language skills and their confidence in using English. Those communication skills are essential in order to initiate and maintain international partnerships and to ensure the comprehensive support of unaccompanied minor refugee students. \r\n\r\n3. Intercultural sensitization is a key issue across all areas of our schools. We would therefor like to reach as many colleagues as possible with the intercultural training course offered by our British partners. However, the course is particularly aimed at those colleagues who work with students from a migrant background, as well as those who are responsible for international partnerships.\r\n\r\nWe expect a significant improvement in English language skills, new methodological skills, and increased confidence in the use of the foreign language. These improvements will have positive impact on everyday work in the classroom, as well as the initiation and extension of international partnerships. The reduction of prejudices and an increased intercultural awareness will contribute to this process. At an institutional level, we also hope for new impulses for our curricula and will explore the possibilities of a bilingual teaching strategy, in the aftermath of our project.\r\n\r\nWe take our employees\u2019 claim to lifelong learning seriously. Extended language skills provide additional qualifications for our staff, from which they benefit - both professionally and personally. As indicated, we also expect positive effects on learning methods and curricula, as well as other institutional levels. Ultimately, these are not self-purposes. It is our students who benefit from a European-oriented, cosmopolitan and multilingual school. This applies to all students, but especially to those with special needs and those whose future lies in international sports or the tourism industry of the region.", "http://www.flyingclassrooms.co.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-DE03-KA101-046810_1"], ["1HE", "Bilingualit\u00e4t entdecken", "The Flying Classrooms Ltd", 73461.0, "Established in Wiesbaden, Hesse, in 1972, the goal of Europa-Schule Dr. Obermayr e.V. has always been to implement education in the spirit of European integration in all of our schools. Multilingualism is one of the cornerstones of our educational concept. We\u2019ve consistently developed the language immersion method, which is in alignment with the natural language acquisition in children. Today, our (German-English) educational portfolio in the Rhein-Main area consists of 10 bilingual nursery schools and pre-schools, bilingual primary schools, as well as bilingual secondary schools.  \r\n\r\nDemand for multilingual education is steadily growing in the Rhein-Main area, with its international financial centre Frankfurt. In light of this development, our schools constantly need to increase their bilingual learning opportunities on all educational levels. With our Erasmus+ project \u201cDiscovering bilingualism\u201d we hope to achieve the following: \r\n\r\n1. It is our goal to extend our existing bilingual pre-school portfolio, and to further enhance bilingual teaching in our schools. In order to achieve this goal, we need to train our non-native English speaking teachers in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) methods. \r\n\r\n2. We need to safeguard the quality of English teaching, as well as bilingual subject teaching. Therefore, our English native-speaking teachers will also participate in teacher refresher courses, focusing on new methods and ideas for the classroom. \r\n\r\n3. Because of our bilingual focus, our schools attract an international clientele. By improving the English language skills (active and passive) of our administrative staff, we further enable them to advise interested parents and to supervise international cooperations.\r\n  \r\n4. Because of our international outlook, staff and students in all of our institutions are linguistically and culturally diverse. As Europa-Schools and International Schools we foster a cosmopolitan and open-minded school culture. Strengthening intercultural understanding and an appreciation of \u201cotherness\u201d is an important and ongoing task for all members of staff. We would like to further this process by training members of staff in cross-cultural communication.\r\n\r\nOur Erasmus+ project \u201cDiscovering bilingualism\u201d will cover 80 mobilities for our consortium of 17 schools of the Europa-Schule Dr. Obermayr e.V.  Among the available course are: \u201cTeaching Young Learners\u201d, \u201cContend and Language Integrated Learning\u201d, \u201cTeacher Refresher Courses\u201d,  as well as \u201cIntercultural Training\u201d.\r\n\r\nAll of our Erasmus+ training activities will be evaluated within the framework of the educational quality management of Europa-Schule Dr. Obermayr e.V.

It is placed in Castelldefels, a beach tourist city near Barcelona.\r\n\r\nOur project is based on improving those aspects that could contribute to increase our educational quality through equity of opportunities. For that reason we define three big areas of improvement that integrate different projects:\r\n\r\nMethodological area:\r\n- Cooperative working, through equal learning.\r\n- Coexistence project: emotional education technics.\r\n\r\nTechnological area:\r\n- Google Apps for Education: implementation of virtual learning environment Google Classroom and usage of Chromebooks in the classroom.\r\n- Robotics: implementation of different work lines through BeeBots, LEGO Maths, LEGO Easy Machines, LEGO WeDo 2.0, Scratch Jr, Scratch and Arduino.\r\n- CISCO Program: organized by the multinational to do computational projects about the Internet of Things (IoT).\r\n\r\nPlurilingual area:\r\n- Participation in Plurilingual Experimental Group (GEP) program.\r\n- Involvement in the plurilingual project: non-linguistic subjects taught in English.\r\n\r\nThe staff consists of 32 teachers and the number of pupils is 472. \r\n\r\nThrough all these years we have participated in many innovative programmes such as \u201cEscola Nova 21\u201d, \u201cXarxa de Compet\u00e8ncies B\u00e0siques\u201d, GEP or CISCO, involving the three big areas and we keep on searching for a methodology to integrate all the projects. For that reason we define the following aims in the school project and the direction one (2016-2020):\r\n\r\nAIMS\r\n\r\n- To improve the pupils\u2019 academic results.\r\n- To promote social inclusion and cohesion.\r\n- To enhance the school management and organisation.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve these aims we propose:\r\n\r\n- To consolidate the methodological change started in the last years, through coworking, multilinguism and new technologies.\r\n- To conclude the necessary training for the applying of Project Based Learning (PBL) at school.\r\n- To increase English time of exposure as a communicative tool by everybody in school (teachers, pupils, non-formal education,...).\r\n- To restructure the resources of the school.\r\n- To participate in an European network of innovative centres.\r\n- To integrate the school project in our neighbourhood and the nearby surroundings.\r\n\r\nThose goals will be reached through the following activities:\r\n\r\nPLANNED ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n- Job shadowing in Catton Grove Primary School (Norwich, UK), with the aim of watching PBL application in a similar school to ours.\r\n- Job shadowing in Hauhon Yhten\u00e4iskoulu (H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland), in order to learn how to use Information and Communication Technology (ITC) in PBL.\r\n- Teacher Training in PBL in Berlin with EUROPASS Teacher Academy, to obtain as many resources as possible related with that topic.\r\n- Teacher Training in ICT in Italy, to get technological resources applicable to PBL.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose we define different professional profiles:\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANTS PROFILE\r\n\r\n- PROFILE 1: Primary tutors to understand how to apply PBL methodology in our school.\r\n- PROFILE 2: English as a foreign language teachers, to observe English as the working language in PBL projects.\r\n- PROFILE 3: ICT teachers, with the aim to learn the implementation of new technologies in projects.\r\n- PROFILE 4: Directive School Managers, to understand the impact of PBL in management and direction.\r\n\r\nTo check the success of the project, we define some assessment summed up in:\r\n\r\nASSESSMENT\r\n\r\n- Short-term changes based on methodological organisation: implementation of PBL in students timetable, increasing English and ICT usage and their spreading through our educational community.\r\n- Medium-term changes related to teacher training and teacher management.\r\n- Long-term changes thought to reinforce the project implementation and to rethink the school spaces to PBL methodology.\r\n\r\nIMPACT\r\n\r\nWe expect to improve pupils\u2019 results through the incorporation of PBL in the timetable and the increment of English and ICT exposure. Teachers will need more methodological and linguistic training and therefore we propose changes on their non-academic sessions. Impact will also be generated in those organisations we already collaborate with and we expect to produce the same impact in the formative improvement of the schools involved in this project.\r\n\r\nDIFFUSION\r\n\r\nFinally, the diffusion of the project will be realised through different channels, being the school broadcasting tools (web, social networks) the main ones.

Our clientele is becoming more and more international, therefore our staff - as well as the institution as a whole - need to enhance their international outlook, as well as their intercultural competence. Our Erasmus+ project 2016/17 was a first, but very crucial step on this way. Internationalisation remains the central task in the areas of organisational and personnel development for the vhs in the coming years. \r\n\r\n1. Every adult should have access to high quality lifelong learning at a low price. In order to achieve this goal, we need to improve our ability to approach, advice, and assess an increasingly international clientele. A key factor in this development is the improvement of the active and passive language skills on all levels of our institution (management, pedagogical planning, administration, as well as teaching staff). While English was the focus in 2016/17, we have now identified French and Spanish as further relevant \u201cbridging languages\u201d and would like to train our staff in both. \r\n\r\n2. We want to promote equal opportunities with our educational programmes. Therefore, the organisation of teaching and learning needs to address accessibility. Especially refugees and migrants, whose first language is not German, need to be approached with the help of bridging languages (English, French, and Spanish) in order for communication and counselling to become possible. This is a relevant task for all of our administrative staff, educational staff, management, and those teaching German as a foreign language.\r\n \r\n3. We want to improve the efficiency and quality of our educational programmes \u2013 particularly in the foreign language department (English, French, Spanish, and Italian). Teaching staff will focus on new methods of teaching, innovative teaching material and improvement of language skills. We would like to build on the success of our previous Erasmus+ project, shifting the focus to French, Spanish, and Italian. In order to attract a clientele with increasing media affinity, we would like to test innovative uses of new media, as well as formats of eLearning. Thus, an important focus of our project will be blended learning. \r\n\r\n4. Supporting intercultural exchange, communication, and integration is an important endeavour for adult learning institutions. Nonetheless, the required process of intercultural awareness and cross- cultural communication in our vhs is not an easy one. By offering intercultural training courses, we would like to promote this development even further in our new Erasmus+ project. \r\n\r\nOur follow-up project \u201cvhs Esslingen international II\u201d consists of 40 mobility activities in four countries. This project is a further milestone on our path towards internationalisation and intercultural openness in our vhs. We can already see the benefits of the 2016/17 project:  our staff\u2019s increasing willingness to engage in foreign language communication has improved addressing and advising our international clientele. We would like to build on this success.

In order to approach and advise our clientele more internationally, our staff, as well as the institution as a whole, needs to start a process towards internationalisation und intercultural capability. \r\n\r\nInternationalisation and encounters within intercultural processes will become a key task for Volkshochschulen and adult education in the coming years. This is particularly true for Mannheim and, therefore, for the Abendakademie und Volkshochschule. The city\u2019s impact within the region and the prominent position of the Abendakademie und Volkshochschule (being the largest provider of adult education in the region) require particular effort with regard to the training and development of all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, Mannheim\u2019s strategies of internationalisation with regard to the New Urban Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals are the driving force for an international orientation which can only be achieved through language skills and intercultural qualification on all levels. \r\n\r\nCentral requirements arise particularly with regard to language skills, intercultural education within teaching practice, and the areas of organisational development, and personell development. Staff of the Abendakademie und Volkshochschule should be significantly strengthened in their use of bridging languages. Through extended intercultural competence, educational staff can react more appropriately and moderate more neutrally, thus facilitating appreciative communication. Initial contact with participants from migrant backgrounds will be more sensitive, we will be able to advise better, and will invite people more effectively to participate in adult education. \r\n\r\nOur Erasmus+ project is an important milestone on our path towards internationalisation of the educational institution Volkshochschule. We will use our strong ties within regional and federal boards to make the project known and to draw attention to its benefits. Our managing director is deputy chair of the Baden-Wuerttemberg, as well as the federal association of Volkshochschulen, and therefore has access to a wide variety of multipliers. Because of our strong ties within the city, the project will also have an impact on Mannheim\u2019s strategies of internationalisation with regard to the New Urban Agenda and the SDGs.
