Until recently, these BNCI systems have been researched almost exclusively in laboratories. Home usage has been demonstrated, though only with on-going expert supervision. A significant advance on BNCI research and its implementation as a feasible assistive technology is therefore the migration of BNCIs into people's homes to provide new options for communication and control that increase independence and reduce social exclusion. The goal of BackHome is to move BNCIs from laboratory devices for healthy users toward practical devices used at home by people in need. This implies a system which is easy to set up, portable, and straightforward. Thus, BackHome will (1) develop BNCI systems into practical multimodal assistive technologies that will provide useful solutions for communication, web-surfing, and environmental control, and (2) provide this technology for home usage with minimal support. These goals will be attained through three key developments: practical electrodes; telemonitoring with home software support; and easy-to-use applications tailored to people's needs. BackHome will build on on-going projects in the FP7 BNCI cluster that laid the foundations for this project and provide us with a network of connections and resources that will be valuable in the project. The consortium combines extensive experience with software development, definition of standards, neuroscience and psychology research methods, user-centred approaches and training users in their homes. We will leverage this experience to get BackHome started quickly, maintain solid interactions with end users, and interact effectively with other key research groups. We will evaluate, disseminate and plan future exploitation of the BackHome scientific and technical results in close interaction with end-users. BackHome will thus have a strong impact on European dominance in the field, in the short and longer term, and could make a real difference not only for the end-users targeted but also for caregivers, support personnel, and medical professionals.", 189165.0, 3394185.0, "BackHome", null, null, null, null, null, null, "fp7_101842_970434464"], ["8PT", "Development of a Rapid Cooling technology for commercial refrigeration applications", "Enviro-Cool Uk Limited", "Commercial refrigerators and freezers are ubiquitous and are used in diverse environments such as supermarkets, grocery stores, service stations, restaurants, hotels, pubs, and caf\u00e9s. The most visible are vending machines and open or closed refrigerated cabinets such as open display cabinets. Combined commercial refrigerator/freezers are estimated to consume 85TWh of electricity per annum. Although incremental advancements in refrigeration technology have been made these do not nearly offset increasing use. These trends thus pose a significant risk to the EC\u2019s overall commitment to reduce energy use by 20% to 2020; improve overall energy security of European and reduce green house gas emissions. Beverage cooling accounts for a large proportion of commercial refrigeration covering products such as vending machines and display coolers. Compared to chilled or frozen food products, the majority of beverages have a relatively long shelf life and it is therefore not required to keep them at drinking temperature prior to consumption. However, this is currently the norm as it is often necessary to provide a chilled drink immediately upon purchase. As a result a wide range and number of beverages are kept chilled for eventual purchase. The logical consequence of cooling a drinks container efficiently and rapidly on-demand is a reduced need for chillers to run continuously. RapidCool aims to develop such a flexible, modular cooling apparatus that can accommodate drinks cans and bottles and chill them rapidly from ambient to around 6\u00b0C. The cooling chamber will be designed to be directly operated by the consumer and meet with usage demands associated with vending machines and open cabinet fridge, with both a standalone unit and multi-can variant providing a faster vending solution. The proposed system can save up to 75% of the energy currently consumed by a conventional vending machine or display cabinet, which equates to cost savings of around \u20ac250 per machine per year.", 408086.0, 1002929.0, "RAPIDCOOL", "Chilled drinks in seconds", "Consumers may soon say good-bye to refrigerated display cases and vending machines.

Reducing energy consumption associated with commercial refrigeration is not only smart for the environment but also soon to be governed by law.\n\nNovel cooling units for on-demand rapid chilling of beverages promise to decrease energy consumption by up to 75 % in comparison to of conventional vending machines. EU-funded scientists working on the project \u2018Development of a rapid cooling technology for commercial refrigeration applications\u2019 (RAPIDCOOL) are on to something big that is now penetrating the market under the V-Tex trademark.Scientists produced a number of prototypes including a six-can system that can automatically handle the cans. Tests demonstrated that cooling rates of less than one minute were achieved with an energy savings of 80 \u2013 90 % compared to conventional open-front commercial refrigerators.\nAutonomous and fast cooling of small batches of drinks will enable vendors to meet even higher demands cost-effectively.\n\nFour patents have been filed and commercial agreements have been established with major supply chain partners. In addition, the consortium has signed an official cooperation agreement with Heineken that will include participation in technical meetings, commercial input and development reviews.

The main objectives for teachers and staff is to learn how agriculture in a changing world is addressed in other agricultural schools,  to learn best practices in environmental issues and sustainable use of land and to discuss subject matters with colleagues and reflect on their own subjects and teaching at home, since AUI is the only agricultural school in Iceland it is vital for AUI's staff to meet with colleagues in other countries.\r\n\r\nFor each year of the project 6 students will go on mobility and take three week long period on a farm either in Norway or Denmark through the vocational partners of the project.  Two teachers will follow the student groups abroad at the beginning of the training period. Coordinators at hosting schools will monitor the training period on behalf of the project.
