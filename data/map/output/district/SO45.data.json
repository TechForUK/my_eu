These principles apply to the human scale robotic systems that currently transform the way we work and live. With DNA-Based Modular Robotics (DNA-Robotics) we will take the first steps to scale advanced robotic behavior to the molecular scale for future medical and technological applications. DNA-Robotics brings together the leading research groups in DNA nanotechnology in Europe to collectively develop an integrated and modular robotic platform and demonstrate applications of the novel technology. DNA-based construction is a natural modular platform, which via the programmability of sequence design and self-assembly allows different structural and functional motifs to be flexibly combined. DNA modules will be developed with a range of novel functions for sensing, actuation and intra-system communication and computing, implementing all of the typical components required for a robotic system at the molecular level. Our overall goal is the creation of the first \u201cindustry standard\u201d for modular robotics by the establishment of a modular \u201cplug-and-play\u201d platform that allows the construction of custom-made nanorobots for advanced applications in research and industry. The ESRs will be trained in and develop functional modules that in close collaboration among the ESRs and Partners will be assembled to advanced molecular robots. The highly interdisciplinary research and training program will exploit the synergy between the different competences of the Partners. The innovative and applied focus is supported by the involvement of the company ATDBio as Beneficiary and five companies as Partner Organization that will also provide complementary skills training and intersectoral exposure of the ESRs. This proposal takes the first steps for future application of nanoscale robots in research and industry and will train future generations of researchers in this field.", 238262.0, 3469591.0, "DNA-Robotics", null, null, null, null, null, null, "h2020_211902_997732495"], ["1DD", "Click Chemistry for Future Gene Therapies to Benefit Citizens, Researchers and Industry", "Atdbio Limited", "Gene therapy is expected to play a key role in next-generation medicine by correcting the underlying genetic causes of disease, thereby facilitating personalised medicine. Current gene therapy methods possess undesirable side effects, including insertional mutagenesis, toxicity, low efficiency and off-target cutting. Questions also remain regarding the optimal methods for delivering nucleases into cells and tissues. These limitations will be addressed through the original and innovative approach of the ClickGene network. \n\nClickGene\u2019s research objectives are to train 14 ESRs in the field of biomaterials development with specific focus on, i.) site-selective genetic engineering, ii.) liposomal nanoparticle drug delivery, and iii.) optogenetic diagnostic probes for epigenetic base detection. Most of our academic partners are key members of COST Action CM1201: Biomimetic Radical Chemistry and all have outstanding international reputations as scientific leaders in their field. This COST Action will play a vital role in both networking and training elements of ClickGene, and in combination with transferable skills training, intersectorial and cross-disciplinary secondment, and industry targeted workshops, the education of biomaterials chemists with expertise in click-chemistry and cutting edge application areas of gene therapy, nanotechnology and biological diagnostics will be achieved. \n\nThe training provided will match the skills required by next-generation research leaders in biopharmaceutical, nanotechnology, biodiagnostic and other industries. Allied to academic strength in this network, ClickGene features highlycompetitive industry partners with expertise in commercialisation of nucleic acid click-chemistry (baseclick, ATDBio) and liposomal and lipidome technology (LipiNutraGen).
