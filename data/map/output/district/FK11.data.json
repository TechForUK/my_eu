This programme will utilise the skills of 4 organisations from Germany, Hungary, Poland and the UK, who have wealth of experience of working with disengaged young people to develop in partnership, a standard approach to enable 96 young people to achieve their full potential.\r\n\r\nIn the programme Reaching the Lost Generation different phases can be defined:\r\n\r\nPhase one \u2013 We identify the groups to be worked with. Each country will identify 2 groups of 12 NEET young people\r\n\r\nPhase two - We would then carry out psychometric testing to identify a base line for each of the individual candidates in the group with regard to their core values, abilities, strengths and limitations, their ability to relate to others, team working, work style and what they want from life in terms of careers. All materials will be produced in the 4 languages of the participating countries.\r\n\r\nPhase three - We would then work with the groups to improve their entrepreneurial skills, we would start in all four countries at the same time, feedback what has been successful, and develop the tool as we learn from each group to construct the most effective programme. Then again we will with work with other groups using the revised materials. The programme would be therefore developed with 8 separate groups, 2 per country.\r\n\r\nPhase four - We then assess the individuals at the end of the programme using the same assessment tool we used at the beginning, which would give us a method of measuring which areas had been the most effective and adjusting those which were least effective.\r\n\r\nPhase 5 \u2013 the progression of each young person in each group would be monitored for 12 months, asking how they are progressing every 3 months and movements into self- employment, employment, education and training monitored and collated in a final report.\r\n\r\nPhase six - the development of a final programme with learning materials developed in the language of each country. The final entrepreneurship programme would be distributed throughout each participating country and would be made available on the internet to all other countries interested in the project.\r\n\r\nPhase seven - Dissemination Group. The dissemination group would coordinate the dissemination of the project through, use of the Erasmus plus dissemination platform, project internet site, project blogs, candidate blogs, candidate case studies, educational articles, presentations, newspaper articles, success story advertising. This group would consist of one person from each of the organisations concerned and a multi media communication specialist to ensure the most effective usage of the current media.", "http://www.traindup.org", null, "erasmus_2014-1-HU01-KA200-002376_3"], ["7BU", "Engagement & Beyond", "Train'd Up Railway Resourcing Limited", 206633.0, "There has been no disputes about the necessity of development, whether be an organization from the educational or business sector. Beside a number of crucial elements, engagement of all stakeholders, leaders and employees alike, is a determinative prerequisite of success. While companies are paying more and more attention on their employees\u2019 commitment and engagement in the contemporary world of work, less attention has been paid on the world of education in the same context.\r\nHaving realized this fact, the current project aims to provide a practical tool for school leaders as primary target group, in order to help them become aware of the main mechanisms of engagement. By using the tool, a clear picture of the current engagement status of their organizations\u2019 at employee level will be received, initially. The tool will also cover a methodology and action plan, the implementation of which will likely increase the level of engagement on both personal and organizational level. Individuals will be empowered via regular practical help to be able to actively influence their own engagement level.  \r\nThe project aims to involve approximately 600 participants of different backgrounds in four partner countries (Germany, Hungary, Poland, UK), among them school leaders, teachers, decision makers, HR-specialists, as well as company leaders.\r\nTo achieve the objectives of the project, initially, a foundation study will be produced summarizing relevant literature on engagement an online questionnaire will be developed according to the latest leadership knowledge and practice. \r\nAs respondents of the questionnaire, educational professionals will be involved, and based on the results, action planning workshops will be arranged for them. These events will result in actionable conclusions, serving as guidelines of development for organizations. The methodology and process of these workshops will also be disseminated.\r\nProfessionals interested in personal development, will have the option to receive individual feedback anonymously, and afterwards different contents including short videos, motivating quotations, summaries of articles etc. related to their engagement level on their electronic devices. The IT solutions will contain gamification elements to raise motivation of participants. \r\nAfter a certain time their engagement level will be measured again and some extent of increase will likely be detected, which will also add to growing engagement on organizational level.\r\nTo enhance links between education and the world of work, inter-sectoral workshops focusing on engagement will be held, in the frames of which representatives of both sectors will have the opportunity to exchange experience and to learn from each other. These events also serve dissemination purposes.\r\nDifferent levels of impact of the project can be identified. The main target groups are teachers (individual level) and schools of different types (organizational level). Individuals and organizations involved, will become familiar with the results of the project throughout the whole process. They all will become aware of the importance of engagement as a development tool both on personal and organizational level.\r\nAt individual level, we expect that participating teachers, especially those who will be included in the personal development program, will experience that they have the power to influence their own level of engagement and, thus, influence their own career and the quality of their work.\r\nAt organizational level, leaders of organizations will understand that engagement is a key factor of success of their organization and that they can influence engagement by making and accomplishing an action plan based on the results of a diagnostic tool.\r\nThough indirectly, learners of schools, as relevant stakeholders will also benefit from the results of the project on the longer term. More engaged teachers will teach better and will be more committed to develop themselves professionally, which adds to better learners' outcomes. \r\nParticipants of inter-sectoral workshops from the business side will understand school organizations better and they will be able to find similarities, especially from the aspect of employee engagement.", "http://www.traindup.org", null, "erasmus_2017-1-HU01-KA201-035998_3"]]}}, "outwardCode": "FK11"}
