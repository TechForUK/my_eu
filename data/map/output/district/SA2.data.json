Also, the forest sector is one of Europe\u2019s most important economic sectors. In recent years, widespread forest mortality related to drought or temperature stress has been described in drought-prone forests throughout the world. Such mortality events can radically transform biodiversity, fire risk, ecosystem function, land-atmosphere interactions and ecosystem services. Remote sensing offers the unique possibility to derive spatially explicit information on vegetation status at local, regional or landscape scale. Great benefits would be expected from remote sensing techniques that quantify the photosynthetic carbon fixation dynamics of the vegetation as a reference measurement of forest health. Increasing efforts are currently been carried out by Europe Space Satellite Missions (ESSM) for sensing solar-induced Fluorescence (F). Satellite missions have recently been launched (GOSAT/TANSO) or are currently under evaluation (ESA-FLEX), and will open interesting perspectives for the early detection of plant stress at landscape level. However, upscaling of these methodologies still requires investigation on challenging issues regarding the interpretation of F retrieved from mixed pixels of hundreds of meters that aggregate vegetation, soil and shadow components and a better understanding of the influence of heterogeneous forest canopy structure, background and viewing geometry on steady-state fluorescence.

Scientists are relating the effect of micro-scale and even nano-scale structural features to measurable macroscopic hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility factors. Analytical techniques, physical testing and in-service data collection are being used to develop a multi-scale integrated model of hydrogen transport from the atomistic to the component level.\n\nResearchers have chosen three case studies covering the combustion chambers of a satellite launcher, future automobile chassis components and wind turbine bearings. The approach is to develop accurate descriptions of hydrogen trapping and diffusion. These behaviours are influenced by atomistic factors such as crystal structure and defects all the way up to macroscopic parameters such as temperature and stress gradients.\n\nScientists must balance and integrate the spatial and temporal differences between atomistic and finite element (FE) models to ensure accuracy without undue computational load. They are using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to facilitate use of the results of atomistic calculations as input parameters to FE-based models. Key model parameters are deduced from experiments exploiting specially fabricated model materials with well-defined microstructures.\n\nThe team has been focusing on detailed microstructural analyses of materials for all three case studies, and evaluation of hydrogen diffusion and trapping parameters through experiments and atomistic modelling. Scientists are now integrating the models at the atomistic, meso (intermediate) and macro scales. During the final year, researchers will expand the library of input data and apply it comprehensively in detailed simulations of hydrogen-assisted failure in industrially relevant components.\n\nMULTIHY's multi-scale modelling framework will assist companies in making informed decisions regarding the materials and processing methodologies they choose for their products.

Farmers rely on correct measurements as the vast majority of farmed fish are arranged pre-harvest. Therefore, an accurate estimation could lead to economic benefits of up to EUR\u00a041 million annually for European aquaculture.\n\nPhone interviews with key representatives of the aquaculture industry were conducted by researchers to determine users' needs prior to designing the FISHSCAN system. Respondents said they required a suitable capacity, power supply and level of automation. Cost, ease of use, reliability, environmental and user safety, and compliance with relevant standards were also considered important factors.\n\nProject partners also studied whether fish behaviour could be altered by different forms of artificial light. This enabled researchers to select lights and cameras for use with the remote monitoring system that did not interfere with the natural behaviour of the fish.\n\nCustom-made lighting and electronics, including a control module for the biomass estimation system, were integrated into the prototype.

The main challenge faced during this work was how to compensate for the reflectivity of fish skin and fish movement. \n\nThe consortium also developed a robust housing for the system that was capable of operating in the marine environment.

This microorganism-based process needs oxygen and reduces PH, thereby requiring expensive buffering treatment.\n\nThe EU-funded DEAMMRECIRC project developed a deammonification reactor to convert ammonia into nitrogen gas in a single step. The process is for use in a RAS, and is suitable for both freshwater and marine species.\n\nResearchers also developed sea salt-adapted inoculums from European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) waste.

These costs matter by virtue of their magnitude, as factors affecting flight costs can have a disproportionate impact on the overall energy balance. Flight costs are fundamentally linked to airflows, as well as behavioural responses to them, because birds react to horizontal and vertical currents by changing flight mode (i.e. flapping/ gliding), speed and route. Even minor route adjustments can radically affect the flow conditions that birds experience due to the uniquely dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the aerial environment. Yet our understanding of how airflows impact birds is in its infancy, being constrained by a lack of information on the metabolic costs of flight. Currently, the main methods for measuring flight costs in the laboratory either restrain the bird (thereby increasing energy expenditure) or suffer from low resolution, and field methods do not allow costs to be resolved in relation to fine scale movement paths. FLIGHT will use interdisciplinary approaches, integrating laboratory and field techniques, to address these grand challenges. Breakthrough methodologies will be used to (1) measure the costs of unrestrained bird flight in the laboratory and (2) derive a new proxy for power use in flight that is linked to flight performance, using accelerometry measurements from cutting-edge data loggers.

Promotion is organised in several different manners of which the most important are: presentations to students by the coordinators, special page per college on e-learning system, Facebook and special attention to international opportunities at open days. Furthermore it is a regular topic during mentoring as part of career development. \r\nMost students go on a long-term placement (12 weeks or more) on an individual bases in the period that is set by the vocational department. Therefore the system is very flexible and individual. Each student receives personal attention by the coordinator who will discuss the students needs and requirements extensively with the partner institution. These are complementary to the standard requirements of the qualification that have to be met as with any other placement in the Netherlands such as  accreditation of the host company and an agreement (POK). The student uses an online step by step approach to prepare for the placement and to fulfil all the requirements of the ERASMUS+ programme. There is also a preparatory programme on Blackboard with helps the students to be better prepared for the circumstances in a different country and in a different company.\r\nDuring the placement the student is supported by the placement coordinator (through telephone, e-mail and Skype) and by the partner institution. This network of experienced support around students is working very well and much is due to the long standing relations ROC Midden Nederland has with the partners of this project. Of course ROC Midden Nederland also provides these services to students of partner institutions. \r\nAfter their return students have to provide documentation to proof that they have met requirements of the qualification as well as the requirements of European funding.\r\nFor teachers the system is also very flexible in time and place. However great emphases is put on the learning objectives of each member of staff. These have to be in line with the strategic agenda of the college and have an impact not just on the individual level but also on departmental level. The system is developed in such a way that the matching of learning objectives and the qualities and opportunties of the partner institution are carefully matched. Upon return teachers have to prove that they are making a difference to their department. Monitoring and evaluation of this process is done in cooperation with the human resources department.\r\nTeachers have provide a report which is published centrally on the intranet and also asked to share their experiences with outside companies and potential students.\r\nThrough both these activities for students and staff ROCMN will become a more attractive provider of vocational education incorperating EU innovations and experiences in the further development of its education.", "http://www.gowercollegeswansea.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2015-1-NL01-KA102-008681_10"], ["8PP", "Project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 97828.0, "This is a project for higher education student and staff mobility between Programme Countries and Partner Countries.

The project hopes to broaden the horizons of our students and help them gain self-confidence and self-reliance whilst completing units of their course in an innovative way.   Students from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) curriculum areas have been chosen as they are priority areas for the Welsh Government and the European Union and are curriculum areas which offer employment opportunities across Europe.   We are also looking to develop these opportunities into the Sport curriculum as Wales has a sports sector that embraces collaboration and encourages new ways of delivering opportunities to increase participation and improve elite performance and this project supports this ethos.  We have a reciprocal partnership with a peer college in the Netherlands in the area of Motor Vehicle, a reciprocal partnership with a peer college in Denmark in the area of Computer Technology, a reciprocal partnership with a peer college in Germany in the area of Digital Technology and a new partnership with Sport Lisboa e Benfica in Portugal for our football students.  Through this project we hope to provide opportunities for 112 full-time (male and female) students aged 16+.Activities and methodology:The teaching and vocational training will have been selected to meet the individual skills and learning needs of each participant based on their CV and individual learning plans.  The learning plans will have been developed based on the skills and learning needs of specific units in each vocational course as well as the individual learning needs of each participant.  Experiences through our partnership will be available at North Copenhagen Business College, Sport Lisboa e Benfica, Werner Siemens Schule, ROC Midden College, BMW, Audi, Ferrari, Bosh, Siemens and Mercedez Benz.Results:The accompanying staff and receiving subject staff, along with workplace supervisors (where applicable), will assess and record the skills and learning competencies demonstrated by each participant.  These will include competencies in essential employability skills such as appropriate behavior, attitude, team working, communication and initiative as well as subject-specific skills.  We expect students to achieve academically whilst gaining confidence, independent decision making, self-reliance and motivation.  All students will have their experience validated via college certificates and a mobility certificate.Impact:Based on previous experiences we expect these activities to have a really positive impact on the participating students' attitude, coursework and behavior having gained real experience and an understanding of teaching practices in another European country.  Being exposed to different practical tasks and techniques will be of real value to future employees and will enhance their coursework.   As an added value students will also have gained a wider understanding of the European economy.Longer-term benefits:We believe that this project will have long term benefits for the participating students.  Gaining this type of experience and being exposed to some of the soft skills that will have been developed by traveling, studying and working in a foreign place will have a really positive impact on the participants.  We believe that their aspirations and desires will change and that their self belief to achieve more will be enhanced.  Again these thoughts are based on seeing the changes in previous participating students.  The impact on the college: We have seen an improvement in the pass rates and grades on courses where students participated in mobilities and a recognition across the curriculum spectrum of the benefits both to individual students and the departments.  We are seeing an increased demand from curriculum teams for their students to participate in future projects.  This has been achieved through disseminating project results via the use of ambassadors, our college website, Colleges Wales newsletter and Europemobility network.

The ambition of the two-year, 120-ECTS programme is to: (a) Reflect the contemporary issues of global journalism, the new technological possibilities as well as different areas of journalism research; (b) Explore the way in which changes in global technology, politics, economics and business and culture, have impacted upon the profession of journalism; (c) Combine theory and practice to produce a more global analytical journalism fit for the changed media environment (including internships). This Consortium is currently offering a joint degree that attracts around 400 applicants of which we enrol 80 high-quality global students. Based on a solid structure of cooperation we aim to move the scheme forward to be a global benchmark in terms of both teaching and research. Three pathways have been identified for this: (1) the development of collaborative research projects in close cooperation with relevant industries and actors and incorporating these projects into the delivery of central course elements; (2) the establishment of a series of innovation workshops or incubator hubs bringing together the industry, students and staff in order to develop new ideas about journalism in a global setting; (3) the development of innovative cross-cultural teaching methods and their integration into the programme. To reach these goals we will launch three joint initiatives: a Global Journalism Research Centre; a Global Journalism Ideas Generator and a Global Multicultural Teaching Benchmarker. These initiatives, anchored in three distinct bodies under the Board of Studies, will facilitate the further development and integration of research, industry links and cross-cultural teaching. Our capacity to reach these goals is verified by experiences gained from ten years of successfully dealing with the issues of developing an integrated scheme and joint degrees. A substantial part of this success is linked to the development of an efficient and transparent governance structure for the joint degrees. Looking forward we will build our new three new initiatives on research from the partners, experiences from the media industry as well as the global network of over 400 alumni.

The participating students stay privately with British families (homestay). Thereby, the students have the opportunity to make use of their language abilities both in the families and in the local community as well as experience the multicultural British culture. \r\n\r\nAs the exchange complies both a study and a work placement with homestay the students have the opportunity to improve both their oral, communicative, intercultural and personal competences.\r\n\r\nFor HHX-students work placements in companies are highly relevant and important in order for the students to acquire commercial understanding and knowledge about British companies.

The project hopes to broaden the horizons of our students and help them gain self-confidence and self-reliance whilst completing units of their course in an innovative way.  Wales has a Sports Sector that embraces collaboration and encourages new ways of delivering opportunities to increase participation and improve elite performance and this project supports this ethos with our partners Sport Lisboa e Benfica (SLB) in Portugal. The objectives of the project are:\r\n\r\n\u2022 To provide students with an enhanced learning experience allowing them to gain knowledge and skills to help them achieve their qualification and improve their employability.\r\n\u2022 To enhance the existing Vocational programme by providing an innovative opportunity for participants to experience a different culture and way of learning and working. \r\n\u2022 To enable participants to experience an exciting and different pedagogical approach to learning and work experience, providing them with the relevant skills and knowledge sought by employers.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that participants will return from their placement having gained valuable knowledge and skills to enable them to achieve their qualification and a wealth of experience to help them progress into either further education or employment. This project will provide opportunities for 80 full-time (male and female) students aged 16+.\r\n\r\nActivities and methodology:\r\nDuring their placement participants will experience a number of different teaching styles which differ from those used within the UK.  Participants will enhance their skills and gain valuable knowledge towards their professional and personal development.   The participants are aged 16-19 and their learning needs will be based on their CV and the learning plan has been developed based on the skills and learning needs of their course as well as the individual learning needs of each participant.  Work experience in a foreign country will present the participants with a number of challenges and barriers to overcome, which will help stretch the individual students. \r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThe accompanying staff will work with host staff to assess and record the skills and learning competencies demonstrated by each participant.  These will include competencies in essential employability skills such as appropriate behavior, attitude, team working, communication and initiative as well as subject-specific skills.  We expect students to achieve academically whilst gaining confidence, independent decision making, self-reliance and motivation.  All students will have their experience validated via college certificates and a mobility certificate.\r\n\r\nImpact:\r\nBased on previous experiences we expect these activities to have a really positive impact on the participating students' attitude, coursework and behavior having gained real experience and an understanding of teaching practices in another European country.  Being exposed to different practical tasks and techniques will be of real value to future employees and will enhance their coursework.   As an added value students will also have gained a wider understanding of the European economy.\r\n\r\nLonger-term benefits:\r\nThis project will have long term benefits for the participating students by gaining this type of experience and being exposed to some of the soft skills that will have been developed by traveling, studying and working in a foreign place will have a really positive impact on the participants.  Their aspirations and desires will change and that their self belief to achieve more will be enhanced.  Again these thoughts are based on seeing the changes in previous participating students.  \r\n\r\nThe impact on the college: \r\nThe improvement in the pass rates and grades on courses where students participated in mobilities and a recognition across the curriculum spectrum of the benefits both to individual students and the departments.  There has also been an increase in demand for such opportunities throughout the College for students to participate in future projects.  This has been achieved through disseminating project results via the use of ambassadors, College website, the Colleges Wales newsletter and Europemobility network.  This work will continue to build a greater interest in the wider Erasmus+ programme in Wales through our partners at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe industry in which these participants will be entering are highly competitive and the college is looking to give them every possible opportunity to gain an advantage to achieve and succeed.

It aims at improving their language skills and also their capacity to adapt to a new environment. During their training period, students will have to perform professionnal tasks that are related to the B-Tec they are preparing (B-Tec in Administrative Studies). This training period will be mentioned on their diploma and their CV, giving them a better access to higher degrees or jobs. \r\nb/ To lead this project, a steering committee has been decided upon.

Being exposed to different practical tasks and techniques will be of real value to future employees and will enhance their coursework.   The project will broaden the horizons of our students and bridge the gap between those with fewer and greater opportunities.\r\n\r\nLONGER-TERM BENEFITS:\r\nWe believe that this project will have long term benefits for the participating students.  Gaining this type of experience and being exposed to some of the soft skills that will have been developed by traveling, studying and working in a foreign place will have a really positive impact on the participants.  We believe that their aspirations and desires will change and that their self belief to achieve more will be enhanced.  Again these thoughts are based on seeing the changes in previous participating students.  The project will support the drive to remove social barriers.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPACT ON THE COLLEGE: \r\nThe project allows the college to benefits in many ways; increased attractiveness of curriculum offerings, innovative learning, transfer of innovation and a motivated and enthused work force and student cohort.   Erasmus+ programmes support the Colleges four 'core' strategic directions and associated aims that will support the College in delivering its vision and mission.\r\n\r\nOur Vision:  To be the best choice for learners.\r\nOur Mission:  To inspire and support our learners to achieve their full potential through the delivery of the highest quality of education and training.\r\n\r\nThe industries in which these participants will be entering are highly competitive and the college is looking to give them every possible opportunity to gain a competitive advantage.  Our project will have the added value of providing our accompanying staff with the opportunity of job shadowing and sharing best practice with their peers abroad.  The proposed activities really will set our student apart from others, this is especially relevant for those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  \r\n\r\nOur project will support bridging the gap between those with fewer opportunities and broadening the horizons of all participants", "http://www.gowercollegeswansea.ac.uk", "GOWER COLLEGE SWANSEA", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA102-047378_coordinator"], ["8PP", "Higher education student and staff mobility project", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 499774.0, "This is a higher education student and staff mobility project, please consult the website of the organisation to obtain additional details.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", "erasmus_2018-1-UK01-KA103-047063_coordinator"], ["9EB", "International Career Pathways", "GOWER COLLEGE SWANSEA", 258314.0, "Development of internationalisation as part of the Erasmus Mobility Charter\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nThe development of internationalisation at a large VET college is not without its issues. There is constant pressure on management and staff for educational change, higher quality and better retention while financial resources are scarce. It is not easy for a topic like internationalisation to be present and heard in this tense environment. Still it can offer welcome opportunities for students and staff and a break from the relentless requirements for reporting and testing. \r\nInternationalisation has also received a welcome boost from the introduction of the excellence programme in 2015. At ROC MN about 40% of the excellence programmes for students is international and placements of students both in Europe and outside of Europe are now seen as being programmes for excellent students. This has led to a more coherent approach of opportunities for excellent students called UP 9more information on www.rocmn.nl/up.\r\n\r\nOverall development\r\nNumbers of students and staff taking part in international programmes is increasing at ROC MN. There is substantial pressure from students and staff on available funds and available places abroad. The Erasmus Plus grant has been matched in recent years by funds made available from the excellence programme and professionalisation. Students are doing placements in countries such as China, New Zealand and Malawi. Students are also going on shorter challenges as part of their personal development to countries outside of Europe such as Japan and Argentina. These additional opportunities have provided a boost to the visibility of internationalisation in the roc and to a recognition of their importance of international links. \r\nThe focus of the international office and the international coordinator has therefore shifted to quality improvement instead of more students or staff going abroad. \r\n\r\nThe shift towards higher quality can be observed as well in a number of different initiatives:\r\nMore regular and higher quality meetings of the international team: The team of the international office and international coordinators meet every month under the chairmanship of a college director, following a pcda quality process. There is an annual agenda with regular evaluation sessions and feedback. Developments and processes are brought to a higher level and standardised by the group. \r\nProfessionalisation of the international coordinators: The team of coordinators is being trained by NUFFIC to achieve a higher impact in their respective colleges; to become more involvement in strategic processes there and to be seen as the expert in this field to be consulted on policy matters.\r\nDevelopment of the Virtual International Office: the central organisation has invested heavily in the development of VIO, an online tool for students going abroad. This tool is aimed at making the whole process of going abroad (with or without an E+ grant) more transparent and easy for the student. However not only that, it is also aimed at creating a higher quality experience with the involvement of other members of staff (such as the stage begeleider) and a bigger emphases on the learning experience through a better learning agreement, a progress section and a letter of reference. It has also freed up valuable time of the coordinators to focus students and staff instead of on forms and bureaucracy. Other rocs have expressed an interest in implementing this tool as well.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of \u201cKeuzedelen\u201d: several colleges within the roc are now developing \u201ckeuzedeel II: Naar het Buitenland\u201d. This will open up a new avenue for students to give their international experience more quality and a better, more coherent, place in their portfolio. \r\n\r\nSetting up partnerships and networks: an important element in the quality drive is also to better integrate international activities with the world of work and with the partner abroad. On 21 April the NAVE2 network will officially start with the signing ceremony of the presidents of 4 large schools / associations in Italy. This partnership with institutions from Spain, Italy, Finland and the Netherlands) will increase mobility between the partners and improve quality of arrangements. At the same time a network of international (export oriented) companies in the region is set up, to look at staffing issues and to increase offers of internationalisation at home.\r\n\r\nIn general it can be said that very important steps are being taken to develop internationalisation to a high quality important element of the strategy of ROC MN. However the pressures mentioned at the beginning will remain and so it will be a continuous (hopefully uphill) struggle.\r\nFor more information see Annex 1", "http://www.gowercollegeswansea.ac.uk", null, "erasmus_2018-1-NL01-KA116-038706_1"], ["8PP", "Optimising  translator training through collaborative technical translation", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 126984.0, "The OTCT project will build on the results and recommendations of the OPTIMALE network, an Erasmus Academic Network of 70 academic and language industry partners in the field of professional translation. The OPTIMALE online survey of language industry employers\u2019 competence requirements showed that awareness of and the ability to implement professional procedures throughout the translation process are key factors in the employability of university translation graduates. This led to the definition of good practice in specific areas of translator training, in particular in the integration of professionally-oriented practices in the curriculum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OTCT project (Optimising Translator Training through Collaborative Technical Translation) aims to enhance the professionally-oriented content of university translation degree programmes via intensive collaborative technical translation sessions in simulated professional conditions (referred to as \u201cTradutech sessions\u201d), and by exchanging good practice and resources on the implementation of project-based teaching and learning in the field of translator training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will involve students and staff in advanced translation degree programmes from seven academic institutions (Rennes 2 University, France; HE Vinci, Brussels, Belgium; Swansea University, UK; Univerzita Karlova V Praze, Prague, Czech Republic; Universitatea Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, Romania; Universita ta Malta, Malta; Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Sevilla, Spain). It will primarily involve 1st and/or 2nd year Master\u2019s degree students (i.e. 20-80 students in each institution) but may also involve students in the final year of Bachelor\u2019s degree programmes where relevant (i.e. Sevilla). Two to three members of the teaching staff from each institution will be directly involved, but a larger number will benefit from the outcomes of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will center on the \u201cTradutech\u201d intensive sessions, with preparatory activities leading up to the sessions and material from the sessions feeding into further resources for use in the classroom. \r\n\r\nFour \u201cTradutech\u201d sessions will take place during the project. Each five-day session will involve students setting up simulated translation companies (i.e. teams of 5-10 students, with specific responsibilities and roles assigned to each team member), who will then carry out large-scale multilingual technical translation projects according to the specifications and deadlines set by their \u201cclients\u201d. Source documents will be authentic technical manuals, reports or multimedia materials which will be translated into the main target language(s) of the partner institutions. The source documents will be in English or French as the case may be. Projects will be managed in turn by students from each partner institution, using collaborative software to exchange resource materials and files and computer-assisted translation software to carry out the translations. \r\n\r\nPrior to the Tradutech sessions, students will receive training in technical translation, project management, quality control and translation technologies, using resources produced by different partner institutions and shared with the other partners within the project. Participants will be briefed on the conditions and implementation of the Tradutech sessions, using tutorials produced by students from Rennes and Cluj with prior experience of such sessions. A joint terminology project will involve students from all the partner institutions, in order to promote cooperation and familiarize them with the use of the collaborative platform set up for the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput from the student \u201ctranslation companies\u201d will be assessed according to professional criteria by language industry professionals and feedback will be provided to the students and used as learning materials in classes following the Tradutech sessions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll students who have completed a Tradutech session (i.e. have successfully carried out the responsibilities and tasks allocated to them within one or several translation projects) and the preparatory work prior to the session, will be awarded 4 ECTS credits as part of their study programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of Rennes Tradutech sessions will be attended by teaching staff from the other partner institutions, who will take part in a parallel training of trainer session. Two other sessions will be attended by students from the other institutions, who will be integrated as full members of the Rennes teams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSustainability will be ensured by teaching and learning resource production and dissemination, the training of trainer sessions, and the production of a Handbook on the implementation of project-based translator training which will be made freely available to other institutions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipating students will benefit from the hands-on experience and professional feedback, while teaching staff will gain experience of project-based collaborative learning methodologies.", "http://www.swan.ac.uk ", null, "erasmus_2014-1-FR01-KA203-008533_2"], ["8PP", "Strengthen HE through Innovative Financial Tools", "SWANSEA UNIVERSITY", 261539.0, "Public funding accounts for 85% of all funding of Higher Education in EU (Eurydice); the economic crisis leads governments to cut public expenditures; education is among the first sectors to fall victim of budget cuts.\r\nThe EU in \u201cModernisation of Higher Education in Europe: Funding and Social Dimension\u201d clearly summarizes this trend: \u201cthe economic downturn led to a decrease in public funding, while demand for higher education continues to increase\u201d.

In addition, SHIFT is a \u201cpriority topic\u201d as it is an innovative approach to increase efficiency of public expenditure and investment in education, including new funding models such as public-private partnerships.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, SHIFT has the objective of alleviating the financial burden of access to and participation in HE of students while increasing the efficiency of public spending in HE by developing an innovative model of virtuous Public Private Partnership based on a financial instrument and model (mix of endowment fund and investment fund) that will generate increased financial resources to be distributed as grants, matching grants and soft loans for HE students. SHIFT is a new funding model that pools financial resources from both the public and private sectors, serving the dual purpose of\r\n1. increasing efficiency of public expenditure: SHIFT enhances sustainability of public resources by generating additional funding opportunities for scholarships of university students. The public funds allocated into the SHIFT model (the endowment fund) will be invested (through the investment fund) and only the profits generated will be disbursed (through grants and soft loans) to students, hence keeping intact the capital (here the sustainability of the public funds)\r\n2. mobilising private resources: SHIFT establishes a virtuous mechanism of public and private partnership.

In such cases, people who do not speak the local language can encounter a barrier to enter the labor market: they either remain outside the  regulated labor market, or, even though they are integrated into the labor market, they have difficulty to maintain a long term and sustainable career. This is especially true for the healthcare sector. Immigrants are a case in point. Due to the fact that their priority is usually exclusively learning the main language spoken in the state rather than the local language of a region. To highlight the importance of being able to use the regonal language in a healthcare setting and especially elderly care: By 2025, more than 20% of Europeans will be 65 or over, with a particularly rapid increase in numbers of over-80s (http://ec.europa.eu/health/ageing/policy/index_en.htm). Hence, the number of bilingual elderly people with cognitive disabilities will increase dramatically as well. An extra complexity in this matter is the role of the use of dialects or minority languages with clients in healthcare settings for their well being during treatment. Language is of vital importance for an individual\u2019s well being as well as ensuring trust in healthcare settings. This plays a vital role in power dynamics between clients and staff such as nurses. A minority language or dialect also shares a stronger \u2018emotional attachment\u2019 (Dewaele 2004; Heinz 2011).      (II) Rationale of the Project and Innovative CharacterIn the last decade, there has been a wide range of experiences in language training at the workplace. However, they mainly focus on the major European languages (English, French, Spanish, German) and do not take into account the specific language needs of some European regions and working environments with a strong presence of a regional/minority language. Even with increasing multilingual societies, language training is mostly standardized and homogeneous and does not take into account the role that each of these languages plays in society or even in the workplace. Workplace communication needs are very often not teachable and neither measurable by standard language reference guidelines, but have to be planned and evaluated in relation to determined working fields. The project would therefore combine both communication and psychological skills, which is unique to the focus of previous European projects.The rationale of this project is hence to develop innovative methods, focused on acquiring communication competences in the (local) languages required in a multilingual workplace.(III) Project DescriptionOverall objective:  To offer a versatile training material toolkit for its use in the language teaching area of any regional language of Europe.Project Objectives\u2022Improving the language skills of people currently applying for work or working part-time in the  elderly care and health care sector and where knowledge of the local language is of high importance and improving the quality of work\u2022To train trainers to be able to teach regional languages to migrants disadvantaged learners focusing in the communication needs at their workplaces \u2022To train trainers to be able to teach communication skills for a bilingual work environments (e.g. continuous switching of the language, oral communication and written communication in different languages)\u2022Improve the wellbeing of clients in healthcare settings\u2022Taking steps towards integration: addresses the multilingual needs of immigrants in diverse communities as well as the multi-sited nature of integration.\u2022Increasing opportunities of migrant workers due to the improvement of their professional communication skills.Main Target Group\u2022language teachers (teachers in public and concerted schools for adults)\u2022adult education trainers\u2022language and vocational training teachers\u2022stakeholders in the field of adult vocational training and support for disadvantaged learning).(IV) Expected Results1.
