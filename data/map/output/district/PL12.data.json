As a setting we encourage children to explore and take risks within their immediate environment and engage with them to take part in the future planning of learning within the setting.  We discuss what they like and dont like and what they would like to discover and learn.  As staff we are always reflecting on our practice through training and research and value new approaches to early years education in order to maintain good, reflective and proactive practice within early years.   However, we have never had the opportunity to observe and compare approaches in other countries and with staff from other countries and believe that the value of attending such training abroad is enourmous and certainly not accessible here.   We value and encourage the interaction of parents in their child's learning through parent/grandparent days and continuous sharing of information and ideas. \r\nWe are a committed strong team that is able to lead change in order to improve and enhance our children's experiences in our setting.  We have systems in place that will allow us to manage the project in an efficient manner drawing on our experience to lead school's projects.  \r\n\r\nThe two participants attending the training who are both experienced and well qualified; being the Manager and Deputy Manager of the setting who between them have nearly 40 years experiences in early years education.  The Manager holds a BA (Hons) Degree in Early Years and has supported other Early Years Professionals in their learning and development and as a Mentor.  The Manager is very proactive and always looking to introduce new learning styles within the setting e.g. Mosaic Approach challenging children in their own learning.  The Deputy has over 20 years early years experience also and is an early years SENCO and has a passion for an inclusive nurturing environment for all children within an early years setting.  \r\nAs a setting we are very reflective and proactive in our development and from researching different types of practice for the completion of qualifications such as the BA Hons Degree and Level 3 qualifications have highlighted the different types of practices throughout Europe.  The importance of creativity in early years and self expression and confidence.  We value family input on each child's learning and would like to learn more about how to engage further with families and their children's learning both at home and in the setting making stronger links.  We are a very creative early years setting and encourage children to express themselves through a wide range of media and feel further knowledge of this type of learning would develop this learning further.  \r\nTherefore , or main areas for development are:\r\nCreativity across the early years setting\r\nNew teaching and learning methods that can support enhancement and change within our practice\r\nDevelop our understanding of other European systems in order to share and learn from each other.\r\nInnovative approaches to teaching and learning in early years\r\nOur methodology for developing the areas identified above are through attendance at a structured training course provided by LEAP: Creative teaching approaches in Early Years course. We feel that this will enable us as a setting to gain further knowledge of children's learning through creativity and exploration and to support our practice in this type of learning.  It will enable to share our own practice with others and learn from other practices both from Italy and the other settings attending the training also from other countries.  It will enable the setting to observe other centers and educators in their role and learn from their diverse knowledge.  As manager and deputy we will be able to share this practice with all staff and give two different view points on the practice observed and knowledge gained.  It will empower staff to explore different creative teaching approaches and to put them into practice. Very empowering and exciting.  In turn this new knowledge will be shared with children's families through meetings and attending the setting.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge and experiences gained by staff attending the Creative Teaching Approaches in Early Years will be shared with all staff through meetings and in house training.  The knowledge gained would be conveyed to staff via in house training through written and practical information thus ensuring staff gain the knowledge first hand.

They have a younger perspective of early years and have come with their own ideas and views of early years  practice and value personal and social development in the highest degree and see creative learning as a major tool for this type of learning, development and support. Intuitively they both believe the importance of supporting a child's emotional needs is paramount within a calm and respectful environment and to use creative learning as a tool to achieve this. This view has stemmed from close family bonds and strong emotional values not from their previous schooling experiences; feeling that schooling didn't support every child's emotional needs.   As a team they are intrigued by the development of a child's learning and have calm and supportive dispositions and value the importance of free creative learning for every child. The team that will lead the Sweden project are both experienced and well qualified early years practitioners , one of which has a Level three qualification and 26  years experience within early years settings from city settings to village settings and the other being the Manager who holds a BA (Hons) Degree in early years and has supported other Early Years Professionals in achieving their status and who worked within early years settings for the last 20 years.   Both team members have a passion for inclusive nurturing environments for all children within an early years setting.   Both believe that children need to explore in a free environment in order to develop their self confidence and self esteem through hands on learning experiences within the natural environment; believing that children should have the opportunity of taking control of their own learning; for the adult to step back and learn from the child. \r\n\r\nWe feel that this will enable us as a setting to gain further knowledge of children's learning through creativity, personalised and explorative play.  It will enable us to share our own practice with others and learn from other practices both from Italy and Sweden and others.  It will empower staff to explore further approaches to learning.
